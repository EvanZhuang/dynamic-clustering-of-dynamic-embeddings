    "Word embeddings are powerful in terms of learning latent semantic structure in language.  Recently, Rudolph and Blei (Rudolph and Blei, 2018) explained dynamic embeddings for language evolution, in which he used exponential family embeddings (Rudolph et al., 2018) which can change over time to capture the change in meanings of words over time. Here in this report, we would like to elaborate some findings on modification of the previous models, where we will have context vectors that change over time, and we will have Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM) to cluster words. We study how this new model performs on United Nations general debates data. "

    "Word embeddings can be used to represent text data. For instance, in frequency based embedding, if we do one-hot encoding on a particular text data, then we will have a vector of the same length as the number of unique words to represent each word. To represent a particular word, we can set the corresponding position in the vector to 1, and others to 0. However, more generally, we do not necessarily have to use such high dimensional vectors to represent words. We can have one vector of much lower dimension(i.e. a much shorter vector) to represent a word, and each position in that vector can be decimal numbers instead of (0,1). In probabilistic programming setting, each position in this embedding vector can be viewed as a parameter. "

Each position in the embedding vector of each observed word is modeled using Bernoulli distribution with probability $p_{iv}$ for each $v$ in the entire vocabulary $V$. $$P(x_{iv}|x_{c_i}) = Bern(p_{iv})$$. The log odds $\\eta_{iv} = log \\frac{p_{iv}}{1-p_{iv}}$, which is a function of $p_{iv}$, can be specified as $$\\eta_{iv} = \\rho_v^T(\\sum_{j \\in c_i}\\sum_{v'}\\alpha_{v'}x_{jv'})$$ Here $\\rho_v \\in R^K$ represents embeddings and $\\alpha_{v'} \\in R^K$ represents context.
