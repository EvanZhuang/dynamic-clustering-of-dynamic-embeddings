The General Assembly has unanimously chosen Mr. Opertti to direct the work of its fifty-third session. Echoing previous speakers, I should like to congratulate him, as I consider his election a tribute to his personal qualities as a diplomat and a statesman. Through me, Madagascar is pleased to express its best wishes for the success of his mission. His predecessor, whose competence we valued, was able to rely on our cooperation throughout his term of office; and Mr. Opertti may also be assured of our complete support in his efforts to accomplish his task successfully. Madagascar reiterates its encouragement and support to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, in his quest for ways and means to make our Organization increasingly dynamic. The great family of the United Nations is meeting once again, as it does every year, to reflect collectively on the situation in the world so as to lay the foundations for 19 a better existence, one which is safer and more equitable, in spite of all our differences and divergences. Madagascar reaffirms its support for the United Nations though its presence every year at this annual gathering. For us, this forum for exchanging views represents the first, universal bastion against injustice and violence in the world, and it is the best tool for safeguarding peace and security and for the promotion of progress. In the light of the statements made here, globalization undoubtedly constitutes the backdrop for our many concerns at this end of the century. With all its advantages, disadvantages and disappointments, and transcending the limits of the economic framework, globalization is today expressing itself in terms of insecurity. Insecurity is spreading virtually everywhere, in many forms and manifestations. Insecurity is being globalized, and whenever a man dies — whether it be in a war, or as a bombing victim, or in a cold-blooded massacre, or simply in his sickbed — somewhere children cry, women suffer by the hundreds, by the thousands, by the millions. And death is more than ever part of our daily lives. This is why today we are focusing our attention on the problems of insecurity and on the need to rally our efforts for the maintenance of peace. The international community is now confronting situations that jeopardize peace and security and that threaten the sustainable development of nations. In many parts of the world, civil wars, inter-State conflicts, border disputes, and ethnic, tribal and religious confrontations resurface, bringing suffering, poverty, political instability and marginalization, be it in Kosovo, the Comoros, the Great Lakes region or elsewhere. Added to this is the persistence of new threats, such as international terrorism, organized crime, corruption, the proliferation of narcotic drugs and the deterioration of the environment. Access to weapons of mass destruction is becoming easier and easier. The proliferation of the light- weapons industry and the widespread use of those weapons are becoming a major scourge for most countries. Insecurity is economic as well as social. In the era of technological progress and of the spectacular growth in world food production, whole regions are experiencing famine and malnutrition. One quarter of the world’s population is still living in poverty. Millions of children under the age of five continue to die of diseases, and major sectors of society are cut off from education and from basic health care. About 180 million children under the age of 14 are obliged to work; the less fortunate have no alternative except sexual exploitation, and for many young people unemployment is the only prospect for the future. Similarly, a large number of women cannot to this very day exercise their fundamental rights. Many remain victims of domestic violence, social injustice, deliberate massacres or armed conflict. Moreover, the financial upheaval that has afflicted South-East Asia, Latin America and Russia has shaken the international economic system. It is true that global information networks have reduced both distances and time, but at the same time they have contributed to increasing scientific, cultural and moral insecurity. Computer viruses have become as dangerous as nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. All of this illustrates the magnitude and the drawbacks of globalization, as well as the scope of the interdependence of States. Fifty years after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the rights and freedoms inherent in the dignity and worth of the human person are still often violated, and we witness the burgeoning of new challenges — challenges that are ever different and that require well-adapted and better-planned strategies. It is obvious that no State in the world can guarantee each of its citizens material and spiritual well-being in conditions of peace and full respect for the most basic rights and freedoms. While in the recent past — and more specifically in 1985, from this same rostrum — emphasis was placed on the balance of forces, in general, and on nuclear parity, in particular, everyone today unanimously recognizes that security cannot exist without cooperation and solidarity, which implies spectacular changes in international relations. Evidence of this recognition is the forthcoming entry into force, on 1 March 1999, of the international Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, as well as the establishment of nuclear- weapon-free zones. For its part, Madagascar, which has never deviated from its commitment to disarmament and which is, in this respect, a signatory of a number of international Conventions, is gratified at the prospects of the negotiation of a cut-off treaty on fissile material for military purposes in the framework of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. 20 We also welcome the call for the holding in the near future of an international conference on the complete elimination of nuclear weapons, a call made by the heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries who met recently in Durban. Along the same lines, Madagascar of course associates itself with the proposal made by President Blaise Compaoré, the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), concerning the convening in the year 2000 of a summit conference under the auspices of the United Nations with a view to the formulation by the international community of a joint response to the problem of terrorism. Like other States, on 18 July, in Rome, Madagascar signed the Statute of the International Criminal Court, as well as the Final Act of the Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries. It would be appropriate to consider the question of security through a multidimensional approach encompassing military, economic and social aspects at various levels — international, regional and national. Poverty and the persistence of imbalances that divide the world into developed countries, developing countries, least developed countries, poor and indebted countries, are factors contributing to tension and obstacles to the establishment of a genuine and lasting peace. This, in any event, is the reality in Africa, my continent. The Cairo Declaration of 1993 established the primary objective of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution in Africa. Nonetheless, without the active support of the international community, these actions would remain ineffective. Security Council resolution 1170 (1998), on the holding of regular ministerial meetings in order to evaluate actions undertaken for peace in Africa, should therefore be welcomed. For Madagascar, it is a question of confirming the will to coordinate actions of the United Nations with the pan-African organization and with regional mechanisms. While awaiting an appropriate mobilization of the resources needed for the effective implementation of actions in the framework of the Agenda for Development, it seems to us vital that the developing countries make their contribution by proposing the establishment of a mechanism to help them attain their shared aspirations and affirm their solidarity. It is in this spirit that the Heads of State and Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, meeting at Durban, considered a proposal to establish, within the Non-Aligned Movement, a mechanism consisting of three funds financed by our own resources, up to perhaps 0.1 per cent of gross national product or a percentage of export income. The funds thus obtained would be capitalized through investment in international financial markets. For Madagascar, this mechanism would help integrate the activities of developing countries into the process of financial globalization and would help resolve, at least in part, their financial and debt problems, in tandem with the actions undertaken by the international community and the financial institutions. A large number of speakers during that session recommended an evaluation of the capacity of the Bretton Woods institutions to adapt to current realities. The three-fund mechanism could be among the basic documents for joint reflection on a new global financial architecture. In implementing the resolutions of the international community, it is a key responsibility of each country to create a climate conducive to lasting peace and economic growth. Among the elements of this responsibility are the establishment of regulations that are in keeping with agreed aspirations, good governance, the creation of adequate systems for follow-up and monitoring, and respect for the rules of democracy. In the present context of global economic liberalization, every development actor has its own role to play, including the State as the protector of the fundamental rights of its people and of its sovereignty and as a catalyst for development programmes. Madagascar, whose Constitution and national laws are based on the principles of the United Nations Charter, endorses those values. In that connection, we are engaged in the process of democratization, good governance and the rule of law, along with economic and structural reforms, to lead our country towards credible partnership in the international system. Our authorities are now committed to implementing recovery programmes aimed at stepping up the struggle against poverty and at creating a climate conducive to the complete fulfilment of the citizen. The institutional aspects of this programme include the establishment of autonomous provinces and of institutions provided for in the Constitution, and the continued reform of the civil service and the judiciary system. 21 In the economic sphere, the State is continuing to pull out of the production sector, and will be doing all in its power to create an environment of vigour and competition and to put financial administration on a sound footing through the creation of bodies to regulate sector-based activities. Finally, in the social area, public expenditures will reflect our priorities: education, health and safety, and security. We are devoting special attention to programmes to make the most disadvantaged segments of the population aware of their own responsibilities. Although the implementation of this programme depends first and foremost on Madagascar’s own efforts, it is obvious that there are limits on our resources for guaranteeing a better quality of life for our citizens and thus for protecting their rights. The strengthening of international partnership should therefore be viewed not only from the financial but also from the scientific and technological standpoints, so that all countries may hope for an equal chance of success. Of that I am convinced.  I extend my congratulations to Mr. Opertti on his election and my appreciation to the former President for all his work over the last year. In looking back over the year, I think we would agree that it has been extremely disturbing for most developing nations. At best, it has been one of troubling uncertainty and a deep sense of frustration. At worst, it has seen terror and despair. It is the uncertainty felt by millions in our own region, caught unprepared by the process of globalization and ending up unemployed. It is the frustration experienced by those like the current, third adult generation of Palestinian refugees who declare with understandable defiance that they have suffered enough. It is the terror of the innocent victims of bombings; of those who flee from civil war; or of those, such as the people of Kosovo and Rwanda, who have experienced savage inhumanity. It is the despair of our neighbours in China, Bangladesh and Papua New Guinea, stricken by devastating natural disasters. For many, many millions of people, the end of this century is not a time for any millennial celebrations. It is a time of enormous human suffering. As many of us remarked at the recent summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, at a time when technology presents greater opportunity for human development than ever before and when the power of globalization offers us unique chances to work together, how can this possibly be? In trying to answer this question, the Non-Aligned Movement recently spoke of a primary need to voice the suffering of the billions it represents. It also spoke of this Assembly as the only forum in which that voice can be heard with the strength and insistence it deserves. That is why I would like to thank our Secretary- General, not just for attending the Non-Aligned summit, but also for displaying heartfelt concern for the special problems faced by developing nations. Above all, I would like to thank him for what I feel is crucial in the developing world today, and that is the call he has made for leadership: leadership in ending local hostilities; leadership in making peace processes work; and, perhaps most important of all, leadership in summoning the political will to translate policies made at the national, regional or global level into day-to-day real benefits for ordinary people. It is leadership, in short, aimed at encouraging two things: first, tolerance in the acceptance of differences and the need to resolve all disputes peacefully, no matter how hard this may be; and, secondly, in placing people at the core of policy-making. As the Secretary-General has stated, the United Nations is a place where the connection can be made — one which is so often neglected elsewhere — between economic and social development on the one hand and international peace and security on the other. We entirely agree with him. His observations reflect the need for us to address not policy positions, but ordinary people’s problems — jobs, education, food and security — and to address them from their own perspectives and needs. That is why we very much appreciate the fact that the various conferences this body has hosted within the last 12 months have been directed towards recognizing people and their day-to-day concerns. This is also very much in agreement with the strong appeal we made last year, when, in the context of United Nations reform, we stated that, whatever we do, we have to be sure that nothing weakens what the United Nations does well for ordinary people. By this I mean its work in the field. It is this which gives the Organization meaning to billions. It is the fundamental reason for the existence of the United Nations today, a body founded in the name of “we the peoples”. So, in commending our Secretary-General’s efforts, I would also like to give him our full support in fulfilling the peoples’ need for economic prosperity and social development, and in ensuring that these two concerns remain firmly connected. This will place the emphasis in the United Nations on work which will reinforce peace and stability, reject violence and confrontation and strengthen the foundation of social development. In other words, nothing in the interests of ordinary people can be solved by violence and war. If they have to exist, let the violence be directed against despair and the war be made on suffering.   Senegal takes pleasure in addressing, through me, its heartfelt congratulations to the President on his illustrious election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. His election is eloquent testimony to his intellectual and moral qualities and to his vast experience in international relations, and also reflects the unanimous recognition by the Member States of our Organization of your country, Uruguay, for its ongoing commitment in the service of international peace and cooperation. We express profound gratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, for the skill and commitment with which he discharged his duty throughout a particularly difficult year. Finally, I should like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, a man of conviction who deserves our unreserved support in the pursuit and achievement of the outstanding work of reform, to which he is fully committed in order to ready our Organization to meet the realities of the twenty-first century. The annual sessions of the General Assembly provide special opportunities for the great United Nations family to come together to consider collectively and thoughtfully the situation of the world and the problems and challenges that our Organization must meet as it seeks to bring about peace, progress and solidarity for human society. As this century fades, we are living in an era marked by major challenges that involve all of us individually and collectively. Our world is in the throes of transformation, internationally as well as within each of our States, and our transition towards the third millennium is not without certain contradictions. Globalization has become a worldwide phenomenon. The movement of people and ideas, the computer and information revolutions, the protection of the environment and the fight against drugs and terrorism have also become transnational phenomena that call for global reform and thoroughgoing international solidarity, which is the only thing that will allow us to attain our major objectives — for while we are all similar, we are also all different. At the same time, fragmentations are increasing and differences are asserting themselves at the national level, thereby leading to civil wars and ethnic and tribal conflicts that often jeopardize the structure of our States. Formidable wealth has been created for a tiny minority, while vast expanses of absolute poverty remain; and while human rights are exalted here, they are mocked or trampled underfoot elsewhere. The United Nations, which is the repository of the universal conscience, must adapt to these changing realities and develop the capacity to act, often with urgency, in the service of peace and to respond appropriately to the legitimate aspirations of humankind. As we seek to attain the goals that are before us, our Member States have the responsibility and the duty to endow our Organization with the tools that will allow it effectively and rapidly to implement the agenda for the twenty-first century. In this context, I should like to emphasize and welcome two major developments that have marked the recent history of the United Nations. I shall refer first to the establishment of the International Criminal Court, not because it takes priority but because the head of State of my country, President Abdou Diouf, has conferred upon me the honour of being involved in this issue for the past two years. Senegal was among the first signatories of the Statute of the Court and is waiting only for the certified copy before ratifying it. The Diplomatic Conference in Rome was without doubt a historic gathering, as for the first time the nations of the world, in particular those from Africa, united by a single and shared desire for justice, together found a legal means of deterring those who might be tempted to commit crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of genocide; a means of bringing them to trial, if there are grounds for doing so; and a means of sentencing them if they are found guilty. In short, we have succeeded in forging the missing link in the international legal system. That gathering will also be remembered as historic because the Statute of the Court, which we solemnly adopted on 18 July 1998, in such a symbolically rich place as Rome, introduced major innovations in relations between States and between national and international jurisdictions. Finally, if anyone needs to be reminded, I am happy to say that the Statute and the final act governing the Court complement, and thereby imbue with greater meaning, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, whose fiftieth anniversary we are commemorating this year as one of the great milestone events in the history of the United Nations. What is more, the Statute makes the ideal of justice more precise and more alive. I am pleased to say that my country, Senegal, recently became the first State member of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to ratify the Protocol on the Establishment of the African Court on Human and Peoples? Rights, which was adopted at the most recent OAU summit in Ouagadougou. Last year, during the fifty-second regular session of the General Assembly, we all warmly welcomed the reform proposals of the Secretary-General, contained in his report (A/51/950) entitled “Renewing the United Nations: a programme for reform”. We were unanimous in believing that those judicious, balanced, innovative and action-oriented proposals were very timely because they were in tune with the spirit and letter of the Declaration issued on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary, which stated: “In order to be able to respond effectively to the challenges of the future and the expectations of the United Nations held by peoples around the world, it is essential that the United Nations itself be reformed and modernized.” (resolution 50/6, para. 14) This conviction, which we all shared, has today become an imperative. Indeed, through the dynamic impetus provided by the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session, Mr. Udovenko, the General Assembly adopted resolutions through which it endorsed and reaffirmed the implementation of the measures and proposals recommended by the Secretary- General. In this regard, I should like to convey my sincere congratulations to Ms. Louise Fréchette, who has been appointed to the distinguished position of Deputy Secretary-General of our Organization, with particular responsibility for development issues. To her, our partner in development, I wish every success in carrying out her honourable and important mission. In calling to mind the reforms that will enable the United Nations to become the cornerstone of a multilateral system better attuned to the realities of the twenty-first century, I could not ignore the delicate and complex negotiations under way within the Working Group entrusted with the question of restructuring the Security Council. Security Council reform is a fundamental element in the overall reform of the United 2 Nations, but we must recognize that it will not be an easy task. We all agree on the need to modernize and democratize that essential United Nations body, but we are finding it difficult to reach consensus, or even general agreement, on such fundamental issues as the enlargement, composition and right of veto. Despite five years of discussions within the Working Group, we must not abandon our hopes and become discouraged. If we redouble our efforts and benefit from the momentum that we have created, I am convinced that in due course we will succeed in this great undertaking to restructure the Security Council by conferring on it greater legitimacy, credibility and transparency. Africa certainly has its place in this reform — a place that must be acknowledged given its history and its destiny as a continent of the future in which there is room for continued growth. The United Nations has traversed half a century, and during the course of those years we have progressively laid the groundwork for an international system that should be able to ensure our collective security. In this regard, our Organization has been and remains an irreplaceable tool for the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security. Despite the numerous achievements recorded in that area, we must agree about how much farther we have to travel, as well as about the bold initiatives to be taken in order fully to secure international peace and security. Longstanding conflicts continue to resist our efforts at resolving them, while a number of fresh crises — a new generation of conflicts linked to an upswell in ethnic or intercommunity violence — continue to be a source of major concern for our countries, especially those in Africa. Thus, in the subregion of western Africa, while Sierra Leone was moving towards the total restoration of constitutional order with the return to Freetown of the democratically elected President owing to efforts by the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity and especially the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), a mutiny broke out on 7 June last, spearheaded by part of the standing army of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. At the express request of the legal authorities of that country, Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, another neighbour of Guinea-Bissau, dispatched troops in accordance with the relevant provisions of the bilateral agreements signed by each of the two countries with Guinea-Bissau. I should like to reiterate that Senegal?s involvement in Guinea-Bissau is designed solely to help restore constitutional order, ward off threats to the safety of the civilian populations and foreigners, and contribute to the strengthening of stability and security in the subregion and throughout Africa. On 26 August 1998, ECOWAS, together with the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, succeeded in inducing the parties to sign a ceasefire accord, the first step towards the normalization of life in Guinea-Bissau. In the Horn of Africa, we have witnessed a drastic downturn in the relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Indeed, the armies of those two fraternal countries — forced by history, geography and culture to live in perfect harmony and peace — launched military operations. And yet there have been numerous initiatives designed to bring about a political solution of this new conflict. The brotherly Governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea should agree to sit down at the negotiating table and endeavour, with the help of the current Chairman of the OAU, the countries of the subregion and other participants of goodwill, to find ways and means of reaching a peaceful solution. Elsewhere on the continent, in Angola and in Somalia, the road to peace is winding — if not tortuous — and uncertainty continues to prevail. Allow me to pay once again from this rostrum a respectful tribute to the memory of Matre Alioune Blondin Beye, Special Representative of the Secretary- General in Angola, and of his companions in misfortune, who included our fellow countryman Moctar Gueye, a journalist, all of whom died in an accident on the field of honour in the service of peace. All of Africa aspires to progress and to a better life, even though the conflicts it is enduring continue to pose major obstacles to a balanced and lasting economic and social development. We therefore have the obligation and the duty, as members of the family of nations, to continue to strive to bring about a world order that is more stable, equitable and just. Aware of this reality, Africans together, working in concert with the OAU and in close cooperation with the United Nations, are participating more and more actively 3 in regional efforts aimed at conflict prevention, management and resolution. I should like to take this opportunity to welcome the publication of the Secretary-General?s report on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa. In this invaluable report, the Secretary-General offers a well thought out and objective analysis of the causes of conflicts in Africa, rightly pinpointing the close link between stability and development, and finally recommending criteria, conditions and ways and means of ensuring, building and safeguarding peace in the interest of sustainable development in Africa. My country, Senegal, convinced of the importance of peace in the Middle East and of the need for greater progress in that respect, is actively supporting the peace process and remains committed to the achievement of peace in the region based on the relevant resolutions and agreements, which must be respected by all parties, if only on the basis of the principle of pacta sunt servanda. The time is ripe urgently to call once again on the parties involved, the co-sponsors and all peace-loving nations to ensure that fresh initiatives are taken to reconcile the widely divergent viewpoints of the Palestinian Authority and the Government of Israel in order to restore a climate of confidence and cooperation, which is the only possible basis for peace and peaceful coexistence among the peoples of the region. Ongoing efforts to bring about general, complete and verifiable disarmament represent a major step in strengthening international security. While significant progress has been made in this realm in the past decade, we must acknowledge that global disarmament, today more than ever, remains a long-range objective. Indeed, the conflicts we have seen in recent years have demonstrated that the massive destruction caused by conventional arms requires that initiatives be taken to deter their proliferation, and in particular the illicit traffic in small-calibre weapons, now a real scourge in Africa. Major efforts are being mobilized on the continent to fight this threat, but it is obvious that Africa alone cannot possibly overcome it. Senegal will spare no effort to contribute to the elaboration of an international convention to fight the illicit traffic in small-calibre weapons. At the dawn of the twenty-first century, the universal character of the United Nations has achieved wide acceptance, and its universality gives our Organization greater credibility and effectiveness. In keeping with this principle, Senegal unreservedly supports the request by the Republic of China to rejoin the community of free nations and to be admitted as a member of our Organization and of its specialized agencies. Accordingly, we have proposed that the General Assembly reconsider that part of resolution 2758 (XXVI) that excluded the Republic of China from the United Nations and from its specialized agencies. In keeping with its purpose — to be a centre where nations work together for social progress through the achievement of improved living conditions — the United Nations has made a remarkable contribution to pinpointing the problems facing humankind. Throughout this decade, the United Nations has held a series of major conferences that have enabled the international community to adopt at the highest political level a set of consensual plans of action. These have laid the foundation for a new global partnership for development based upon the principle of national responsibility and the imperative of international solidarity, in the quest for a united response to the challenges that face all of us. Never before has so generous and so highly promising an approach been taken to the concerns felt by the community of nations. These action plans, apart from their degree of relevance, constitute a set of formal commitments on measures that should be taken together. Without the corresponding mobilization of new and additional resources, the specific actions expected from these noble initiatives, whose grandeur and legitimacy derive their very force from the ideals embodied in the Charter itself, are liable to translate into severely compromised or dashed hopes. Above and beyond the problems linked to implementing the results of the major conferences held throughout the decade, the fact is that international cooperation for development now poses a paradox that we cannot ignore without betraying the ideals of peace and development that inspired the founding fathers of our Organization. 4 Miguel de Unamuno, Rector of the University of Salamanca in Spain, once said: “Under certain circumstances, to keep silent is to lie”. How, then, can we remain silent before the obvious contradiction between the incessant expansion of needs for economic cooperation for development and the constant decline in official development assistance, which is today at its lowest level in 25 years? How can we forget the persistent imbalances in multilateral international trade, whose first and foremost role was, after all, to ensure for everyone, in developed and developing countries alike, the benefits of a trading mechanism that was to be open, regulated, transparent, equitable and predictable? What values of humanity can still be invoked when at the dawn of the third millennium, in a world that has become a global village, over a billion men and women are deprived of even the barest elements of a decent life? The marginalization and exclusion that haunt the daily lives of these men and women give proof once again of the absolute priority that the fight against poverty must have at both the national and international levels. This is why strong measures to breathe new life into North-South exchanges are today more imperative than ever. The General Assembly?s high-level debate devoted to relaunching a dialogue to strengthen international cooperation through partnership and the draft plan for an international gathering at the highest level for development financing are encouraging initiatives, as would be initiatives for fair compensation for commodities and a global settlement of the debt crisis of developing countries. The fifty-third session of the General Assembly coincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The promotion, consolidation and expansion of the underpinnings of the State based on the rule of law throughout the world; the strengthening of national institutions for the defence of human rights; the integration of human rights into the major activities of the United Nations system; the promotion of the right to development — these seem to us to be the essential pillars of a global policy for the benefit of human rights and freedoms at the end of this century. In this context, my delegation would like to salute the major initiatives undertaken by Mrs. Mary Robinson, High Commissioner for Human Rights since she took office, particularly those directed to our continent, Africa, which are fully in keeping with our expectations. This means, in fact, that more than ever before, we must promote dialogue with Governments, strengthen dialogue between institutions within the United Nations system and strive to rationalize the machinery of human rights. The fight against the global drug problem remains a concern shared by the entire international community because of the multiple and pernicious ties that drug- trafficking has been able to establish with phenomena such as transnational organized crime, terrorism, large- scale banditry and illegal arms-trafficking networks — particularly those involving small calibre weapons, especially in Africa. This illicit trafficking in narcotics and psychotropic substances has become a dangerous threat to the peace, stability and security of all nations, States and regions of the world at the end of the millennium. This is why my country, Senegal, welcomed the holding last June in the presence of numerous heads of State and of Government in this Hall of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the drug problem. Now it is important for all of us to work for the effective implementation of the important conclusions reached at that meeting, both at the national and international levels. Before I conclude, allow me to say a few words about the financial crisis and the need to strengthen the effectiveness of the United Nations. Our Organization has been in the midst of a very worrisome financial situation for several years now. The causes of this situation have been debated at length right here and it does not seem necessary for me to recall them now. I would simply like to stress that the reform process that we have all undertaken cannot possibly be brought to a successful conclusion within this situation of financial instability that the Organization is experiencing at a time when it is being called upon to act on many different fronts. The new international context, and the multidimensional nature of the challenges to be met require that we have a restructured and modernized United Nations that is endowed with the capabilities necessary to come to our help in resolving our disputes, eliminating injustices and disparities and avoiding exclusion and selfishness. It is enough for us to want these things, because we possess the resources and capabilities to attain them. Humanity has already met so many challenges in the course of its troubled history that we can have no doubt 5 now that it is indeed capable of meeting the challenges of the third millennium as well. So far as we are concerned in Senegal, under the leadership of Mr. Abdou Diouf, President of the Republic, we are ready to shoulder our responsibilities in a genuine spirit of solidarity and collective effort in order to realize our ambitions and dreams. We owe it to ourselves, but especially to the generations to come.  Allow me to congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti on his election to the important post of President of the General Assembly at this session. This is a testimony to the widespread recognition of the country that he represents. I am convinced that his rich experience and diplomatic skill will allow him to successfully conduct this session of the Assembly and deal with the important tasks before it. I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Mr. Udovenko, for his fruitful work over the past year. It would be difficult to underestimate the importance of the United Nations in the fields of peace and security, development, human rights, ecology and economic cooperation. Kyrgyzstan wishes deeply to see the Organization successfully reformed. The SecretaryGeneral’s “quiet revolution” of institutional reforms, begun a year ago, has given new strength to the United Nations mechanism. The first, most important steps towards making this revolution a success have already been taken, but a great deal remains to be done. As the previous session showed, the process of reforming the Organization so that it is prepared to respond to the challenges of the coming millennium will require more time and more work than expected. The reforms of the United Nations will be incomplete if they do not apply to all of its organs, including the Security Council. We judge the Council by its effectiveness. In that connection, we support the Secretary-General’s proposal to expand the role of the Council. We share his view that the Council should deal with economic and social processes, which have an impact on peace and security, just as energetically as it works to resolve political issues. We also believe it essential not only to improve the working methods of the Council, but also to expand its membership. In our opinion, the quantitative expansion of the Council should take place in both categories of membership and provide for equitable geographic representation. Further, the new permanent members of the Council should have all the privileges appropriate to their status. The difficult reform process that all aspects of Kyrgyz society have been undergoing during the seven years of our independence has yielded certain results. The main result has been the preservation of political stability, further democratization of the society and the extension of economic reforms. Lacking access to the sea, Kyrgyzstan is seeking new transport routes, which are essential for facilitating the movement of goods, capital and services into the region. It is acquiring new information technology and electronic communications, which will help the country modernize. Kyrgyzstan wishes to develop regional cooperation within the framework of the Central Asian economic community and the Commonwealth of Independent States. It also believes in the necessity of cooperation with other regions. In that connection, I would like to mention the timeliness and importance of President A. Akayev’s doctrine of “Silk Road Diplomacy”. A revival of the idea of the great Silk Road presupposes the transformation of the area along the road into a zone of stability, security, cooperation and equitable partnership. The idea of reviving this road also represents a commitment to creating favourable conditions for increased international cooperation so that we can take joint action to solve the global problems that confront mankind at the threshold of the third millennium. The national strategy of the Kyrgyz Republic highlights sustainable development as the basis for stable and secure human development as we enter the new millennium. The implementation of the decisions adopted at the World Summit for Social Development are of 29 immense importance for the Kyrgyz Republic. For countries with economies in transition — countries seeking to find their way to sustainable growth — it is especially important that there be coordination and joint action within a revitalized United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions and regional organizations in order to accelerate the integration of these countries into the world economy. A priority for Kyrgyz development is solving the three-headed problem of modern times: how to promote the economy, ecology and social development. I should point out that ecology is the cornerstore of sustainable development for Kyrgyzstan. The harmony of man and nature is at the heart of the sustainable development programme adopted by the Government of Kyrgyzstan last year. Kyrgyzstan is a mountainous country; most of its territory — 95 per cent — is covered by mountains. Mountains, as is well known, are an important source of fresh water, biological diversity, mineral resources and energy, as well as being extremely important for tourism. At the same time, however, mountains means surprises and dangers. Earthquakes, landslides, avalanches, floods — all threaten human lives and require enormous financial and material expenditures. In that connection, Kyrgyzstan is deeply grateful to United Nations Member States for their support of its initiative to declare the year 2002 an international year of mountains, and we request them to continue to support the initiative at this session of the Assembly. The Kyrgyz Republic’s policy of peace, which is focused on the new trend towards a multipolar global system, presupposes, inter alia, a safe, non-nuclear future. The specific steps Kyrgyzstan has taken in the area of nuclear disarmament and in strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation regime confirm its commitment to this policy. Appropriately, the Central Asian countries’ initiative to create a nuclear-weapon-free zone was on the agenda of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly. During that session a resolution on the establishment of such a zone in Central Asia was adopted by consensus. Today it is a pleasure for me to state that the consultative meeting of experts of Central Asian countries, nuclear-weapon States and the United Nations, which took place on 9 and 10 July in Bishkek, laid the legal foundation for the Central Asian initiative. This is a new stage in the creation of the zone. In this connection, we believe it useful to continue regular meetings between experts of the regional working group and those of the nuclear-weapon States, with the participation of representatives of the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency. This year’s session coincides with the fiftieth anniversary of United Nations peacekeeping operations. Kyrgyzstan completely supports the peacekeeping efforts the Organization has undertaken in various global hot spots. At the same time, we believe that, along with peacekeeping operations, more attention should be paid to the early prevention of conflicts — so-called preventive or quiet diplomacy aimed at preventing disputes from turning into conflicts. Kyrgyzstan is seriously concerned by the armed conflict that has lasted for almost two decades in Afghanistan. We are also seriously alarmed at the military confrontation and the grave humanitarian situation in Kosovo, the situation in Africa and the absence of progress in the Middle East, Cyprus and the Korean peninsula. However, we are equally concerned about the financial crises in South-East Asia, Russia and Latin America and the nuclear- weapons tests conducted by India and Pakistan. For, as history shows, the sources of conflict, despite being very different, are at the same time very similar. Armed conflicts are accompanied by violence, mass exodus of refugees, illegal trafficking in drugs and weapons and flagrant disregard for and violations of human rights. The territory of countries experiencing armed conflicts is often utilized to train professional mercenaries and terrorists. Terrorism long ago crossed national borders and became international in nature. Thousands of innocent people have become its victims, including children, women and elderly people. Particular phenomena of the past century have been terrorist bombings and nuclear terrorism. We support the proposals for accelerating work on a draft convention to combat acts of nuclear terrorism. Kyrgyzstan firmly opposes any form or type of terrorism and calls on the international community to pool its efforts against this global threat. Kyrgyzstan’s six years as a Member of the United Nations have been a good training ground for participation in the United Nations family. Together with other countries, we have striven to establish a world of greater justice, to achieve social progress in the interest of humankind and to assert human dignity and equal rights for all. As the twenty-first century draws closer, what the world becomes will depend primarily on our joint efforts — the efforts of all United Nations Member States.  Let me first of all, through you, Sir, congratulate the President of the fifty- third session of the General Assembly upon his election. I am confident that our important work will be guided in a most productive way. I would also like to thank the former President, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his relentless work and creativity to bring about consensus on the Secretary- General?s important reform proposals for the United Nations. Before proceeding to my statement, I would like to report that this afternoon an important resolution on the situation in Kosovo was adopted by the Security Council. The resolution is a firm response to a stark reality. The Council spells out what Belgrade must do now towards achieving a political situation and to avoid a humanitarian disaster. Their deeds and not their words will determine further Security Council action. Also, the Kosovo Albanians must act in accordance with the demands in the resolution. As a Council member, and now as its President, Sweden has worked persistently for such a clear message to be sent by the Security Council. I trust that it will be heard and understood. Sweden aligns itself with the statement made yesterday by my Austrian colleague, Mr. Wolfgang Schüssel, on behalf of the European Union. Economic turbulence, persistent poverty and environmental degradation provide a sombre background to this session of the General Assembly. So do crises and conflicts, terrorism and nuclear test explosions and, of course, the political and financial realities affecting the United Nations itself. We receive early warning signals, but early action rarely follows. Isolationism and unilateralism could easily re-emerge. Many are concerned about the difficulties they face in meeting the requirements of a globalized international community. The positive aspects of globalization — integration and economic progress — offer the best opportunities we have ever known for achieving peace, democracy and development. When trade, economies and financial markets do not recognize any borders, politics must be global as well. The United Nations has to continue to reform in order to remain relevant. The Swedish Government stands firmly behind the reform efforts of the Secretary-General to streamline the Organization, to focus more on its core activities and to introduce a stringent and up-to-date management culture. Member States cannot shy away from their responsibility for the Organization. United Nations reform is not a cost-cutting exercise, but one of rendering the Organization more effective. It cannot be reformed under the threat of political and financial crisis. No Member State has the right to set conditions for fulfilling Charter obligations. All debtors must pay their assessed contribution in full, on time and without conditions. I will speak today of five key areas for global response, international cooperation and common action. First, we must strengthen cooperation to eradicate poverty. Poverty is not only lack of material resources. It is also lack of knowledge and influence over one?s own 32 life. It is a question of justice. The principle at stake is that of equal rights and opportunities for all. A prerequisite for success in the fight against poverty is that the poor themselves are involved in a partnership based on common ethics and mutual trust. Democracy, development and peace are closely linked. Empty stomachs do not provide a sustainable ground for democracy. Individual human security and the security of the planet must be given as much recognition as the security of States. Putting an end to poverty is imperative. Large economic inequalities and lack of civic infrastructure create friction between individuals, between groups, between countries. Marginalization spurs violent conflicts. Security cannot be seen primarily in a military perspective. Development and economic integration play a much greater role in preventing serious conflicts. In an increasingly globalized world the fight against poverty is a common interest and a common duty. Only on the basis of solidarity can we create a world which respects the equal rights and value of all its people. It will require not only efforts by poor countries, but also by richer countries. Therefore, I regret that only four countries meet the United Nations aid target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income. Sweden is proud to be one of them. The seven largest economies on average contribute only 0.19 per cent. Free trade still remains to be fully achieved. Remaining barriers which prohibit poor countries from making use of their comparative advantages are counter- productive and must be abolished. The trade policies of industrial countries should also facilitate regional cooperation among developing countries. The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative must be strengthened, as the debt crisis creates vicious circles for weak economies. The international financial system has proved to be insufficiently adapted to political and social realities. Secondly, we must strengthen cooperation to promote human rights. Societies which respect human rights are more stable and more peaceful. Repression spurs rebellion, violence breeds violence. This year we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It has given hope to people all over the world. It has inspired human rights advocates to expose violations in their own countries. It has encouraged Governments to take action to protect and monitor respect for human rights. But much remains to be done. Primitive expressions of public vengeance have no place in a civilized legal system. Today, a majority of the Member States have abolished the death penalty or placed it under a moratorium. This is sometimes done in response to public opinion, but also frequently as a result of political leadership and with the support of international norms and standards. Economic, social and cultural rights create the basis for a sustainable society with strong democratic participation. The exploitation of children drastically illustrates the importance of these rights. A convention on child labour should be agreed at the next international labour conference, and urgent national and international measures should be taken to combat the most disgusting form of exploitation — child prostitution. The use of child soldiers is another fundamental and increasingly frequent violation of the rights of the child. It is vital to achieve international standards against involving children under 18 as combatants and to combine this with practical and preventive measures to help and protect children in need. The rights laid down in the Universal Declaration apply to all. Special norms for vulnerable groups are necessary to ensure that they can be equal with others. The principle of non-discrimination is of particular and critical importance for individuals who belong to ethnic, linguistic or religious minorities or to indigenous peoples. This principle should be complemented with national mechanisms to ensure effective participation in society. Few measures would be more important to prevent conflicts within and among States. The adoption of the Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court is a milestone in the struggle against genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Sweden will become a party, and I urge all States to do the same. It is imperative to close the gap of impunity. Thirdly, we must strengthen cooperation to deepen democracy. The United Nations should increasingly become a leader in worldwide efforts to strengthen and deepen democracy. It is essential to develop civil, open 33 and pluralistic societies; to promote equal participation of all women and men in political life; and to ensure independent media, freedom of speech and the rule of law. I suggest that the time has come to look systematically at how the United Nations system as a whole can be even more effectively put to use to promote democracy. Already in 1795 Immanuel Kant stressed the strong connection between peace and democracy: “If the consent of the citizenry is required in order to determine whether or not there will be a war, it is natural that they consider all its calamities before committing themselves to so risky a game.” (Perpetual Peace) Democracies seek security in cooperation with one another rather than through deterrence — in openness rather than in secrecy. Democracies also have a proven record in dealing with internal tension and strife without resorting to violence. Strengthening democracy helps prevent violent conflict, by allowing for differing views and interests. A democratic culture provides the ground for reconciliation. The common values inherent in democracy also provide fertile ground for peaceful cooperation to build society. The free exchange of ideas, people and goods creates interdependence and common norms. The future becomes a shared opportunity. This is illustrated by developments during the last decade in Sweden?s own neighbourhood, the Baltic region. For half a century, the Baltic was a deep trench separating East and West. The same sea today unifies free countries in blossoming trade, political cooperation and people-to-people contacts. Fourthly, we must strengthen cooperation to bring about disarmament. In May this year, two States — India and Pakistan — exposed their nuclear ambitions by conducting a series of test explosions. These aspirations endanger international peace and security, as well as stability in the region and international non-proliferation and disarmament efforts. This was why Sweden and Japan took the initiative to prepare a Security Council resolution deploring the testing. After a decade of great promise in the field of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, the spectre of nuclear weapons is again at the centre of attention. The possession of nuclear weapons — by any State — cannot be indefinitely accepted as legitimate. On 9 June, I and my colleagues from Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia and South Africa made a joint ministerial declaration on nuclear weapons. In the declaration, we urge the five nuclear-weapon States and the three nuclear-weapon-capable States to clearly commit themselves to eliminating their nuclear weapons and nuclear capability and to start work immediately on practical steps to this end. We also set out a series of mutually reinforcing measures providing a road map to a world free from nuclear weapons. At this session of the General Assembly, the eight nations will follow up the declaration with a draft resolution. This initiative has already been presented from this rostrum. We invite all Member States to join us in supporting this draft resolution and, inter alia, call for the accession by all States to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the entry into force of START II and negotiations on START III, the prompt de-alerting of nuclear weapons and the withdrawal of non-strategic nuclear weapons. New and forceful impetus is urgently needed to regain the momentum for nuclear disarmament. It is necessary to counteract the tendency to assign new importance to nuclear weapons. These weapons must neither be given increased emphasis in defence planning nor be seen as a means to counter threats from other weapons of mass destruction. The world needs a new international agenda for complete nuclear disarmament. We must at the same time redouble our efforts to rid the world of all biological and chemical weapons. The threat of terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction adds to the urgency of disarmament efforts. Strict adherence to international agreements, strengthened verification and controlled weapons destruction are essential parts of a long-term strategy against terrorism. International control regimes to limit the transfer of technology that could be used to produce weapons of mass destruction as well as other armaments must be further developed. The proliferation of small arms and light weapons is a serious threat to peace, security and development. Such 34 weapons have been the primary cause of casualties in almost every recent conflict on the United Nations agenda. Practical and concrete measures — such as collection, safe storage and destruction in the context of peacekeeping operations — should be the focus in dealing with small arms and light weapons. Therefore, the Swedish Government supports the Mali initiative for a West African moratorium on the production and transfer of such weapons. I warmly welcome the forthcoming entry into force of the Ottawa Convention. This is a major step in the struggle against the plague of anti-personnel landmines. Concerted efforts will be needed to ensure its full implementation as well as the adherence of the largest military Powers. Fifthly, we must strengthen cooperation to prevent armed conflict. Stable peace does not suddenly turn into military conflict. War normally breaks out after a period of gradual deterioration. Prevention has the best prospects of success at the earliest possible stage of such a process. The need for early action is obvious. Nevertheless, decisions are taken at a late stage — often too late. There are strong forces at work which obstruct early action — forces hiding behind arguments about sovereignty, public opinion and national interest; forces defining security as stability and order, rather than dealing with the underlying causes of conflicts. After almost two years on the Security Council we are more convinced than ever of the urgent need to build political commitment for preventive measures and to develop, hone and refine preventive instruments. It is a question of political will. It is a matter of allocating resources. It is about looking for solutions that are sustainable over the long term, even when strong forces want to focus on short-term needs alone. National responsibility for conflict prevention is fundamental. International law makes every State responsible for its international behaviour. States should also be expected to account for their internal actions, which often have major external consequences. Sovereignty should stand for responsibility and accountability. Conflict prevention is also an international responsibility. The United Nations possesses a wide array of instruments for preventive action. Lessons have also been learned from a wide range of peacekeeping operations. A new generation of peacekeeping operations is emerging, often with a flexible mix of civilian, military and police components. International service is a key task for the Swedish armed forces, and increasingly also for the Swedish police. To be effective, the United Nations — and, in particular, the Security Council — must act promptly, unitedly and in unison with regional actors. Several regional organizations have identified conflict prevention and peaceful settlement of disputes as key tasks. The growing network of European security organizations is one example, cooperation between African States another. Cooperation with regional actors is crucial but complex in today?s growing grey zone of conflicts — domestic in origin but international in impact. They often involve neighbouring countries as recipients of refugees, as weapons suppliers or even as participants. In such situations, the United Nations must be faithful to its global principles, but must also find a way of engaging regional actors in peaceful solutions that guarantee the legitimate security interests of all. When regional leadership is available, the role of the United Nations should be one of providing support and, when international military peace operations are needed, authorizing and monitoring. When regional leadership is lacking, the United Nations must be ready to lead. I have highlighted five key areas and objectives for the United Nations: the eradication of poverty, the promotion of human rights, the deepening of democracy, the achievement of disarmament and the prevention of armed conflicts. Yet the uniqueness and strength of the United Nations lies not in any single field of activity, but in the totality of them all. Peace, security, democracy, human rights, social justice, humanitarian relief, sustainable development and prevention are inseparable. In a time of difficult political and financial challenges for the Organization, it is important that we spell out our expectations and priorities. We will have to work hard to allow the United Nations to realize its potential. We owe it to the United Nations — and to each other — to give it the chance to succeed. It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Mr. Opertti on his election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. I would also like to commend the efforts of his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, whom we recently welcomed to our country. I should also like to place on record our appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan. He has been working tirelessly to promote the authority of the United Nations, advocating respect for the international legitimacy for which it stands, especially in the area of finding peaceful solutions to the explosive conflicts that are raging in some parts of the world. The international community has recognized his great achievement when he succeeded a few months ago in defusing an ominous military confrontation in the Arab Gulf region. We hope that this will be followed by similar successes in other volatile situations plaguing different parts of the world. The hopes that are pinned on the United Nations assume a special meaning at this session, which coincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, an instrument which Lebanon participated in framing. Today, human rights are a major pillar of the new world order. Respect for human rights has become the yardstick by which the democracy practised in countries is judged. Compliance with the provisions of the Declaration under all circumstances and conditions guarantees not only the peace, security and stability of societies but also the establishment of relations of cooperation and understanding among States. The United Nations is duty-bound to enhance its independence since it was liberated from the impact of the cold war and of the bipolarity which held sway over international relations in the post-Second World War era. Today, it is called upon to reactivate its role in making and consolidating peace. This task can be achieved primarily by addressing the root causes of conflicts, through preventive diplomacy and through various 18 technical and development assistance programmes in various fields. It is important here to refer to the fact that international institutions have an important role to play in providing the developing countries with the necessary technical assistance. Such assistance will enable them to take advantage of the accelerated pace of globalization in the field of trade and finance. It will also give these countries sufficient time to adapt and get ready to face the new challenges. This will help many developing countries avoid the negative effects of surging globalization, given the inadequacy of their production capabilities and the absence of a competitive edge. In this regard, Lebanon is effectively contributing to the establishment of a free trade zone specifically in the Arab region while continuing its commitment to the establishment of trade liberalization worldwide. On the eve of the twenty-first century, the United Nations role requires it to fulfil the tasks of reform and streamlining so that it can keep up with the fast pace of international relations. Thus the reform measures initiated by the Secretary-General must be completed. Furthermore, the reform of the working methods and streamlining of the Security Council to increase its membership and make it more representative should also be completed. Once reformed, different States, particularly small States, will be enabled to participate in the decision-making process relevant to the maintenance of international peace and security. We commend the efforts that went into the establishment of the International Criminal Court whose Statute was recently adopted in Rome. Lebanon supports the establishment of the Court and is determined to study its Statute positively. More than ever before, the international community is called upon to promote the peaceful settlement of disputes, especially in extremely sensitive regions of the world. We need also to address the root causes of the problems and thereby to defuse the crises before they turn into full-scale conflagrations. The time has come to solve pending problems, particularly those of the Middle East region. For instance, a settlement must be found to the question of the three islands in the Gulf disputed by the United Arab Emirates and Iran. Such a settlement should restore the disputed islands to their rightful owners and thus promote peace and stability among the States and the peoples of the region. If we are truly interested in the promotion of regional and international peace and security, we must work in all seriousness to build a world free from weapons of mass destruction. In this context, we aspire and call for the establishment of a zone free from nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. Five years ago, I was privileged to stand here before the General Assembly to speak about Lebanon and about its commitment to a just and comprehensive peace. From this very rostrum, I declared that Lebanon is committed to the principles of democracy, liberty and human rights, and that it has succeeded in safeguarding these principles even through its darkest moments. In this context, reference should be made to Lebanon?s firm position of condemning terrorism in all its forms and manifestations including political, cultural and economic. We condemn terrorism whether sponsored by States or by individuals. Lebanon condemns attacks against civilians, embassies and diplomatic missions, plane hijacking and any other act that jeopardizes the lives and property of civilians. However, we must stress the importance of distinguishing between terrorism and peoples? rights to resist the forces of foreign occupation in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and in its successive resolutions adopted by the international Organization and other fora, especially the Declaration of the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations. Lebanon is fully committed to the role of the United Nations and is keen on furthering this role and on safeguarding the equilibrium and integrity of international relations. We therefore believe that it is important for all States, large and small, to commit to the principles of international legitimacy and refrain from undertaking unilateral measures that are driven solely by narrow interests and dictated by expediency. Today, as we reiterate these constant positions of principle, we can point with confidence to the originality of our experience in coexistence, which is based on moderation and tolerance, and our firm belief in both deserves to be a living model that should be emulated whenever solutions are sought to the problems of societies afflicted with wars, racial or factional strife all over the world. This is particularly true of societies that are trying to restore civil peace as part of their post-conflict peace- building efforts. 19 Lebanon, with an open and creative society, a society that is Arab by identity and orientation, has remained united in territory, population and institutions; Lebanon has remained a vibrant oasis of goodwill and beneficial interaction. As is well known, Lebanon has for the past few years embarked on a reconstruction plan following a protracted devastating war. It has been tirelessly working to regain the prominent cultural and economic position it once held in its region and in the world, depending on God Almighty, then on the will and resourcefulness of its own citizens and on the support of its brothers and the contributions of its friends all over the world. Throughout this period of reconstruction, Lebanon faced difficult circumstances caused first and foremost by the continued Israeli occupation of parts of its territories and by the continuity of its devastating attacks against its villages and peaceful citizens. These attacks have claimed the lives of many innocent civilians, men, women and children, and wounded many many more. I am confident that the international community still remembers very well the Qana massacre perpetrated by Israel in 1996. Lebanon has faced a critical stage of its history through the past few years while implementing the reconstruction plans. The only parallel to the intensity of this stage is the determination of the Lebanese people to face the various challenges on more than one front. Lebanon has succeeded in regaining the world?s confidence in its ability to play once more a distinguished and shining role in the cultural, economic, commercial and financial fields. Beirut is back to its position as the crossroads of various cultures and civilizations, a fact attested to by the many conferences and the regional and international meetings that were convened there. The United Nations building that Lebanon has recently completed as the focal point for United Nations activities in Lebanon and in the region is proof, if any was needed, of Lebanon?s keen interest in the return of international organizations to Beirut. As an indication of international confidence in our performance, the world financial markets traded in treasury bonds issued by the Lebanese Government and institutions of the private sector. This was made possible by the cooperation between the Lebanese financial institutions and their international counterparts. It is a demonstration of the confidence that the world has in the present and future of the national economy and of the confidence of the Lebanese themselves in their country and its future. But to date, Israel has not wanted to meet its commitments; it has not done what it promised to the Palestinians and to the international community; it does not want to resume the negotiations with Lebanon and with Syria from the point at which they left off. We invite the institutions of the international community to play a more effective role in securing compliance with the resolutions of international legitimacy. They must bring the necessary pressure to bear on the aggressor to remove the causes of this conflict and lay the foundations of a just and comprehensive peace. Israel cannot merely pay lip service to peace and expect to be considered a truly peace-loving State. Talking about peace is one thing; Israel?s actions on the ground are another. Israel?s claim that it is a weak country surrounded by hostile neighbours is one thing; Israel?s military might, based on weapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons and state-of-the-art Western weaponry, is another. Israel has all those weapons and is the mightiest Power in the Middle East. But it does not want to implement or respect the resolutions of international legitimacy. We went to the Madrid Peace Conference with the other Arab parties sincerely hoping to achieve a just, permanent and comprehensive peace that would end the continued cycle of violence that has engulfed our region over the past 50 years. The negotiations on the Palestinian track remain in a vicious circle, and the repercussions of Israeli intransigence could very well shatter our hopes for peace; the negotiations on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks have come to a complete standstill as a result of the intransigent position of the Israeli Government. We reaffirm our permanent commitment to the noble objective of achieving peace. We have previously declared that the accomplishment of this goal lies in the full, immediate and unconditional implementation of United Nations resolutions. On this occasion, we reiterate our total rejection of any settlement of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. We call upon the international community to increase its voluntary contributions to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) pending the implementation of international resolutions relative to refugees, particularly resolution 194 (III). As we repeat our commitment to a just, comprehensive and permanent peace, we declare that we 20 in Lebanon and in Syria are ready to resume the negotiations from where they were stopped. We are ready to sign a peace treaty with Israel within three months, on the condition that it withdraws from the South, from the West Beqaa, and from the Syrian Golan to the lines of 4 June 1967. Peace negotiations aimed at achieving a just and comprehensive peace — the peace that we always proclaimed our desire to achieve — can only be accomplished on the basis of the Madrid terms of reference, in accordance with the principle of land for peace. These should be pursued on two parallel, inseparable tracks with Israel: the Lebanese negotiation track and the Syrian negotiation track. The interdependence of the twin tracks was a strategic decision dictated by the supreme interests of both Lebanon and Syria. This interdependence enhances the prospects of a just, permanent and comprehensive peace. We have previously declared, and we repeat today before this assembly of nations, that neither Lebanon nor Syria will sign a separate peace agreement with Israel. Lebanon and Syria are committed to the resolutions of international legitimacy. We continue to be committed to peace as a strategic choice. Peace as we see it is a peace built on justice, a peace that will restore usurped rights to their rightful owners fully and without diminution. Any initiatives that ignore these principles and bases are nothing more than manoeuvres predestined to failure. They will only prolong the conflict with all that this implies in terms of squandering the human and economic resources of all concerned. They will further postpone the permanent, just and comprehensive peace which we still uphold and aspire to. To us, this will always be the only viable means to achieve the prosperity and progress of our people and of the other peoples of the region. The voices that were recently raised calling for the establishment of military alliances in the region on the pretext of confronting certain trends of thought can only be seen as attempts to bring the region back to the atmosphere of alliances and confrontation. Time and again, history has proven these to be harmful to the interests of peoples. They can only lead to negative results that will obstruct the peace process. So long as the Israeli occupation and assaults against our people continue, we shall continue to uphold our right to resist occupation and to use all legitimate means to which peoples who have had to endure the injustices and evils of occupation have resorted previously. The Lebanese resistance in southern Lebanon and the West Beqaa is in pursuit of a legitimate right supported and endorsed by the entire Lebanese people. The Lebanese people who, like other peoples whose lands have been occupied, have been resisting occupation, and appeal to the international community to spare no effort in helping to secure the release of its citizens who are incarcerated in Israeli prisons and in detention camps under Israeli control in the occupied Lebanese territories. Hundreds of our sons have been languishing in Israeli jails and detention camps for years. Some have already served the prison sentences handed down by Israeli courts, yet are still in custody for reasons unknown to anyone. Others have been in custody for years but have not yet been arraigned. Their incarceration continues under an arbitrary measure that Israel calls “administrative detention”. We have been trying to secure the release of all Lebanese detainees from Israeli jails with the assistance of friendly and brotherly States and with the active involvement of the International Committee of the Red Cross. We appeal to the United Nations and to other international humanitarian agencies to give this matter their utmost attention. We also call upon them to plead with Israel to improve the living conditions of these prisoners, who live in unbearable, inhumane circumstances that run counter to international laws and conventions. Lebanon finds itself today twice victimized. On the one hand, it has to endure continued devastating attacks by Israel, attacks that can be justified only under one rubric: Israel?s stubborn clinging to its occupation and to the flimsy pretext of security. On the other hand, Lebanon sees how the international community is incapable of doing what it takes to restore its legitimate rights through compliance with the just resolutions adopted by this international Organization, in particular Security Council resolution 425 (1978), which calls for unconditional Israeli withdrawal from the Lebanese territories. Lebanon, which for 50 years has dearly paid for the establishment of Israel, suffers from the double standards which have so far obstructed the implementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978). The United Nations, which has made continuous efforts, and whose peacekeeping forces have made the ultimate sacrifice, in the South, remains the best witness to the indiscriminate nature and ferocity of the Israeli attacks against the Lebanese. The United Nations peacekeeping forces have repeatedly been the direct target of Israeli bombardment, including the 1996 shelling of the 21 headquarters of a battalion of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, in Qana, which was the scene of a heinous massacre in which scores of Lebanese lost their lives. Here we would like to pay tribute to the fallen soldiers of the United Nations who have died in Lebanon, victims of Israeli acts of aggression. Lebanon considers them to be its martyrs too. From this rostrum, we honour their memory. We salute each and every member of the United Nations peacekeeping Force stationed in Lebanon. We express special thanks and appreciation to the friendly States that have contributed troops to that Force. On the occasion of the departure of the Norwegian battalion that has worked in Lebanon for over two decades, allow me to express, on behalf of the people and the Government of Lebanon, our thanks and gratitude to the Norwegian people and Government for their enduring commitment to and participation in the Force. Many members of the Norwegian battalion sacrificed their lives in the line of duty. Lebanon has the right to demand that the international community and the United Nations, which represents international legitimacy, should make every effort to secure Israel?s compliance with international resolutions and its withdrawal from its territories. Lebanon, which believes in peace, will work with its brothers to consolidate this peace and make it a foundation for a new life in the Middle East region. Achieving this noble objective will not only translate just resolutions into tangible action, but it will also further the confidence of small States and nations in an authority that will guarantee their rights, their very existence and their future. In conclusion, I would like to address the Israeli people to tell them that the Arabs, specifically Lebanon and Syria, have taken a strategic decision, namely the peace option, which is the difficult choice. This is the strategic option which we uphold and for which we work in the interest of the future of our nation and that of our children. For peace to be realized, Israel also has to follow suit for the sake of the future of its children. Peace requires courage and a broad vision of the future. Lebanon and Syria have made their choice. Will Israel make the same choice?   Please accept my sincere congratulations, Sir, on your election. I am convinced that your solid academic background and valuable experience as a statesman will serve your country, Uruguay, well, and will strengthen Latin America?s image. I also congratulate the Secretary-General on the excellent report he submitted to the General Assembly at this fifty-third session. It is a document rich in profound analysis and noteworthy proposals for these new times. I am speaking on behalf of Venezuela before the General Assembly of the United Nations at a time when my Government?s term is drawing to a close, in just a few months. Venezuela?s words are candid and sincere, for we are ever at the ready to make our modest but solid contribution to the establishment of stable friendship and an effective and durable peace among all the peoples of the world. The century that is drawing to a close has left a deep imprint on human history. Two gigantic wars nearly put an end to our civilization?s impressive progress and, above all, to the respect for human rights that is fundamental to all progress. An unparalleled revolution seemed destined to change decisively the face and destiny of the world, and the end of that revolution was the most striking and fortunate surprise the world has ever seen. The world war that started in 1914 revealed to the horror-stricken eyes of the world the human capacity for evil and destruction. But it was followed by two decades of lavishness and squandering that made people forget the root causes of the conflagration. The attempt to create a League of Nations awakened ideals and showed the way, but it disintegrated when the thunder of cannons announced the outbreak of the Second World War. The subsequent post-war era, enriched by the bitter lessons of experience, encouraged by suffering and inspired by the ideals of peace and liberty, lived for five decades under the threat of nuclear war. The terrible catastrophe predicted as the inevitable result of the so-called cold war remained at the forefront of the world?s concerns until the memorable fall of the Berlin Wall, which opened the new era in which humanity now finds itself. For half a century peacekeeping has been a difficult and sometimes agonizing task. Faith in ideals was not enough to resolve the problems; what was needed was the will and firm purpose, illuminated by experience. The United Nations has undoubtedly played a very important role in this peacekeeping task, despite all the deficiencies and errors it could be accused of. It has been the irreplaceable forum where all countries could talk to each other, where all ideologies, all ethnic groups, all political systems, could meet, without losing sight of the goal of encouraging and fostering freedom everywhere and of practising and promoting, by all legal means possible, the democratic system, the only system that is truly compatible with respect for human rights and the free competition of all to govern. The Organization has managed to keep its respected position, and today we hope to be able to strengthen it further so as to work firmly together to confront the new problems and realities, something that will require ever greater efforts. The century that is coming to an end has also been a time of incredible transformations. Air travel, which had 10 been the dream of a few visionaries, has become an everyday reality, and each hour thousands of people fly in and out of airports around the globe. The great adventure of space exploration has now left progress in air travel behind, starting with man?s travels to the moon. The very nature of the planet we live on has been the object of comparisons that take us across infinite distances in our thoughts about the basic nature of the universe. The position of our solar system and the global unity we live in, in relation to the whole cosmos, is a subject we are trying more and more to define and penetrate. Furthermore, in just a few short years, compared with the span of history, the communications revolution has made the world more unified, more interdependent, more in need of standards and systems that cannot be imposed by the most powerful, but must be the result of consensus, with respect for each individual?s identity and right to life. In today?s society we are fully conscious of the infinite presence of what is large, but we also have a precise idea of the importance of what is infinitely small. The technological revolution has not left an iota of knowledge untouched by its transforming impact. And those who cultivate thought, pure science and art laboriously search for new avenues, driven by a zeal that arises from the progress already achieved in changing mankind?s way of life. We strongly favour the Secretary-General?s plans for reform of the Organization. We are convinced that the Security Council must be enlarged. The establishment of the International Criminal Court represents an important step in the juridical life of the international community. The fight against drug trafficking and terrorism increasingly requires that the international community become its centre of coordination. These are delicate and demanding problems that cannot be left to the individual actions of States, however powerful. The international community therefore faces an arduous task. The fight against poverty has been one of the most important aspects of international action in the last few years. The World Summit for Social Development reflected one of the priority concerns of the United Nations. The ongoing activities of specialized agencies and the projects of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) mark out a clear path in the search for a solution to this problem, a path that must be extended over the whole surface of the Earth. We know full well that peace, true peace, stable and permanent peace, requires justice, and that justice is most truly expressed in social justice. This was recognized by the victorious countries in the Treaty of Versailles at the end of the First World War, and it was also expressed in the Declaration of Philadelphia of 1944 by the belligerents about to triumph in the Second World War. The fight against poverty is ever more necessary and urgent, for the market economy and the current globalization process cannot on their own respond to the demands that social problems make on world leaders. In addition to its positive aspects and the progress it undeniably entails, the complex phenomenon we have come to call globalization can also have progressively negative effects on the emerging developing countries. Faced with the world?s present imbalance, we must therefore make a special point of emphasizing the harmful effects of international financial speculation. The balance of terror imposed by the cold war has been replaced by a lack of financial discipline, by ruthless speculation that is alien to the values of solidarity and ethics that should prevail even in technology?s most sophisticated advances. The poorest countries are the traumatized victims of this reality, but the whole world community may be threatened by this situation that will affect even the advanced countries. No one can escape the consequences of this situation. I therefore believe that today?s international agenda must concentrate on this critical point, giving it priority over other objectives that, though also important, must give way to this indispensable matter. My country?s delegation to the United Nations has set forth, first to the Group of 77 and then to the General Assembly, the need to call a special meeting to study the financing of developing countries. If financial assistance to the developing countries is not addressed on a priority basis, if the necessary resources are not forthcoming from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as well as other agencies dealing with the basic aims of development, globalization will not be as successful as we could hope it to be. The effects of the Asian crisis on Latin America have resulted in the weakening of some currencies, a significant downturn in the capital markets, rising internal interest rates, restrictions to the obtention of external credits and a rapid increase in the risk factors for many emerging countries. The visible effects of the phenomenon of globalization have demonstrated the imperfections of the international financial and monetary system, which has 11 recently been characterized by, inter alia, the sharp impact of the participation of powerful financial groups and the decisive actions of certain parties, such as the agencies that assess risk, certain of which have become a worse threat than the terrible forces of other times. The time is ripe to encourage a better understanding between developed and developing countries, all equally affected by financial instability. Venezuela believes that financial and monetary issues must have a permanent place on the agenda of the United Nations system. To that end, the exchange of ideas between the Organization and the international financial institutions that make up the Bretton Woods system must be encouraged and strengthened. Fundamentally, globalization will depend on the balance between rich and poor, between the more advanced, the intermediately advanced and the least developed nations, and on the application of equitable formulas to alleviate the external debt burden referred to by the Secretary-General in his report. At the end of the twentieth century, there is no more important objective than to steer the concern of the international community in this direction. If measures are not taken to put an end to the abuses of what His Holiness John Paul II called savage capitalism, which gives rise, with its excessive desire for profit, to unstable situations that are transmitted with vertiginous speed to all the world?s economic centres, we will have replaced the fear of nuclear war with the threat of an economic and social catastrophe. It is my view that in today?s globalized world, one of the primary commitments of the community of nations, working through and coordinated by the United Nations, is to strengthen its resolve to prevent and correct unacceptable imbalances, and to ensure the awareness and capacity of the international financial mechanisms for facing contingencies. In a few weeks, the people of Venezuela will go to the polls to elect their new leaders. For 40 consecutive years, at each constitutionally determined interval, the transfer of power stipulated by the Constitution of the Republic has been carried out. In shifting circumstances, the institution of democracy has remained stable in an atmosphere of full and absolute freedom. A difficult economic situation and the winds of change that are blowing throughout the world and are becoming stronger on the eve of a new millennium have focused Venezuela?s political debate on the idea of change. I am nevertheless convinced that, despite the change Venezuela envisages, its people?s love for liberty and democracy as the best system of government and its commitment to fight for peace and understanding among all nations will remain unaltered. May I remind the Assembly that, although our fight for political independence was perhaps the bloodiest of the nineteenth century, we have not had a single violent conflict with any other country since the birth of our Republic. In international forums, Venezuela has distinguished itself by its constant support for universal peace and has always made its modest contribution to any initiative in favour of justice and peace. That is why I can assure the Assembly that the next Government of Venezuela, whatever the electorate may decide, will continue to follow the same path within the United Nations. The Organization can rely on Venezuela for anything relating to service to any and all human beings, or to friendship, cooperation and peace among nations, and anything required by the fight against crime, poverty, drug-trafficking, terrorism, hatred, discrimination — all the evils that have beset humanity. We trust that the United Nations will always stand against those evils as a shield against adversity and a beacon of hope.   My country and my delegation wish to take this opportunity to extend to Mr. Didier Opertti our warmest congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. His election to the high office is a tribute to both him and his great country. My delegation also wishes to convey our deep gratitude and appreciation to the outgoing President at the fifty-second session of the Assembly, His Excellency Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, who presided with boundless energy, vision and competence. Change is a fact of life in our world. Change covers new paradigms, new systems, new technologies, new patterns in international relations and new initiatives aimed at lasting peace and international security. Thus we welcomed the wind of change in the area of nuclear disarmament when we adopted the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) two years ago. My country was the first to ratify the Treaty. But the more things change, the more they remain the same. Some months ago, India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests. My delegation calls on India and Pakistan to reconsider their nuclear pretensions and to become parties to the CTBT. We call on all countries to become parties to this Treaty and to fully implement the provisions of the Treaty. My delegation would like to see the CTBT improved to set a clear time-frame for the elimination of all nuclear weapons. As an imperative for meaningful change, my 24 delegation urges all nuclear-weapon States to destroy all stockpiles and arsenals of nuclear weapons, and in so doing rid our world, once and for all, of nuclear weapons. My delegation also calls for meaningful change regarding the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction. Let us rid our world of chemical weapons and biological weapons. We call on all nations to become parties to the landmines Convention so that we can all act collaboratively and meaningfully to rid our world of landmines as well. Over the past three decades, the developing countries of the world have waged a desperate struggle for fundamental change in international economic relations in order to attain economic justice and facilitate economic development and sustained economic growth — thereby laying the foundation for eradicating the problems of high unemployment, hunger, disease and poverty, which ravage the least developed and developing countries. The establishment of the World Trade Organization was supposed to have laid the foundation for a new system of international trade relations which would contribute to the development of developing and least developed countries. As a developing island State, we seek Members? support and indulgence in understanding the special needs and the vulnerability of small island States. They should be differentiated further, as a separate group of disadvantaged States. The work has already started on the determination of criteria for such differentiation based on a vulnerability index. Among the members of the United Nations organizations, development is measured through the human development index, which takes into account the expansion of gross domestic product, real gross domestic product per capita, life expectancy of the population and other yardsticks. However, the hurricane that recently struck a number of islands in the Caribbean, the devastating tidal wave in northern Papua New Guinea and extreme drought conditions in many countries, including mine, demonstrate the vulnerability of small island States to natural disasters. We also sympathize with China and Bangladesh, which have suffered from extensive and prolonged flooding. In Fiji, the Government right now is providing special food and water relief assistance to more than 54,000 households, or more than a quarter of Fiji?s total population. Because of the drought, we are expecting this year a 50 per cent reduction in our production of sugar, which is our main export, and there is no guarantee for an improvement for next year. Also, because of the drought, we do not have seeds of sufficient quality to allow for a quick recovery in the foreseeable future. Such is our vulnerability, and no part of the aforementioned index has any real relevance to our calamity. Things may have changed, with new names and new systems, but, alas, it is the same old story. I appeal to the United Nations development support system to consider special schemes of assistance covering natural disaster situations. There are already examples of such schemes in the Lomé Convention between the European Union member countries and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States. The creation of the World Trade Organization was intended to lay the foundation for changes in international trade by ensuring an open, secure, equitable, transparent and predictable multilateral trading system. Yet developing countries continue to be paid paltry prices for their primary products; they continue to be denied access, under one pretext or another, to the markets of the developed countries; and even the little export trade we have is being taken away, as in the case of Saint Lucia and its banana exports to the European Union. Export trade is vital to economic development and sustained economic growth in developing countries. My delegation calls for remedial change in international trade — facilitating better prices for primary products, greater access to the markets of developed countries and the retention of special trade arrangements for the essential exports of developing countries. We in the developing countries require substantial foreign investment capital flows to promote economic development, sustained economic growth and social and human development. Regrettably, there has been little change in the volume of international capital flows, the pace of such flows and the direction of such flows. Where flows have taken place, they have been directed to a handful of developing countries. My delegation calls for strategic change in the area of foreign investment through substantial, increased and continuous capital flows to developing countries. 25 We in the developing countries require new, environmentally sound technologies to facilitate and sustain economic development and social and human development. There is a dire need for us to participate in and benefit from appropriate, environmentally sound technologies. Yet despite our pleas for the cooperation and assistance of the industrialized countries for reciprocal change — by the transfer of appropriate technologies at an affordable price, by assisting us in institutional development and capacity- building to accommodate the transfer of such technologies and by assisting us with funding, education and training programmes to facilitate the transfer and stimulate increased cooperation at a business-to-business level — the situation has remained virtually the same. Sustainable development is critical to small island developing States such as mine, for which the paramount challenge is to balance economic and social development with environmental protection. Six years have passed since the first Earth Summit in Rio, and the second summit has come and gone. Little progress has been made in securing new sources of financing for making the transition to sustainable development. My delegation calls for stimulating change on the issue of sustainable development through the prompt and full implementation of the commitments and recommendations of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. The reform of the United Nations to make it more relevant to today?s world and more responsive to the needs, aspirations and hopes of the international community in all aspects of international relations has engaged our attention over the years, and more so last year with the presentation of the Secretary-General?s reform programme. If the reform of the United Nations is to bring about purposeful change, then the Charter of the United Nations should be revised to remove the anachronisms contained in it and to make it more relevant to our world today and tomorrow. A geographical reconstruction of regional groups adapted to the geopolitical dimensions of today?s world ought to be implemented. We submit that the current set of regional groups should be increased numerically and reconfigured. My delegation further submits that the membership of all United Nations organs and organizations should be governed by the principle of geographic rotation, so that each country can enjoy its right as a Member to serve on all United Nations bodies. The current system of rotation has resulted in some countries becoming de facto permanent members of the United Nations organs and organizations. The Security Council is a classic example of things remaining the same. Membership on the Council, permanent and non-permanent, continues to be geographically inequitable. The system of rotation does not provide all Member countries the opportunity to serve on the Council, and the system is further aggravated by the number of regional groups and their geographical configuration. My delegation continues to call for a review of the membership and operations of the Council. International peace and security has been one of the main pillars of the United Nations. This year marks 50 years of United Nations peacekeeping as an instrument for maintaining international peace and security. Yet we all are still beset by conflicts of one kind or another, and lasting peace and security in our world continues to elude us. My country is fully committed to the international peacekeeping missions of the United Nations. In fact, this year also marks 20 years of participation by my country in United Nations peacekeeping. I should like to take this opportunity to pay homage to our brave sons who have made the supreme sacrifice in the service of international peace and security. Because of the eminent contribution of international peacekeeping to permanent and lasting peace and security in our world, we call on all Member countries to settle their assessments for peacekeeping operations promptly and fully. My delegation would like to take this opportunity to express to the Secretary-General our sincere and deep appreciation for citing Fiji, among other countries, as consistently among the stalwart nations ready to contribute troops, police and observers and to take other steps to improve overall readiness. My delegation deeply appreciates the meaningful change that has taken place in the scale of assessments of Member countries. My country welcomes the new assessment rates. But while such a beneficial measure has taken place, the arrears in the annual contributions of some Member countries continue to plague our coffers and to place the finances of our organizations and our many and varied international programmes in jeopardy. My delegation calls on all Member countries which are in arrears in payment to pay those arrears promptly, fully and without conditions. At a time when so many changes have taken place in our world in the areas of human development and human rights, the bleak future of the world?s indigenous people has remained the same. My delegation calls on the 26 international community to be more responsive to the need for a better future for our indigenous people. In the interest of meaningful change, my delegation calls for the speedy adoption of the draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the setting up in our Organization of a unit for indigenous peoples? affairs, the granting to the indigenous people of the right of self-determination, and the establishment of an international fund to promote and facilitate their survival, development and progress. My delegation is aware that the most pervasive violation of human rights is violence against women, which cuts across all boundaries of culture, economic status and geography. In this connection, the Government of the Republic of the Fiji Islands has maintained the commitments entered into at Beijing through the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action and met its obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. In promoting greater participation by women in economic and social development, a major initiative by the Government will be the launch by our Prime Minister, in the next few days, of its National Plan of Action. Addressed in the Plan will be areas such as the development and strengthening of women?s enterprises, gender parity at decision-making levels, training, promotion and appointments, domestic violence, sexual abuse and child abuse, and review of laws which disadvantage women. One area of meaningful change in our world has been the Convention on the Law of the Sea. It enjoys universal support and almost universal participation, and all States benefit from the stability and certainty that has been achieved by the Convention. The work being done with respect to the oceans requires the support of the international community if the achievements of the Convention are to be consolidated and its promise of benefits to the peoples of the world realized. Sadly, the more things have changed in the Middle East, the more they seem to have remained the same. Peace in the Middle East remains as elusive and perpetually shifting as the Negev desert. The international community must play a stronger and more decisive role in getting the peace process on track, keeping it there and ensuring that it moves at a faster rate. We call on all the parties to the crisis to pursue positive and genuine negotiations to effect meaningful change through compromise and achieve a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. My delegation calls for conciliatory change in Lebanon with the full implementation of resolution 425 (1978) in order that Lebanon may fully enjoy its territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence. Similarly, my delegation believes that a concessional change is necessary to find a solution to the situation in Kosovo. My delegation calls on the parties to the internecine conflict to enter into constructive dialogue on a political solution that should include a substantially greater degree of autonomy and meaningful self- administration in the territory. The issue of Taiwan has remained unchanged. China and Taiwan contribute significantly to the development of the South Pacific region. My country is committed to a one-China policy and enjoys very good relations with both China and Taiwan. We therefore warmly welcome the renewed talks between China and Taiwan and hope that they will lead to profitable change on the Taiwan issue. Likewise, on the Korean peninsula, we urge South Korea and North Korea to continue their dialogue to amicably resolve their common future. The removal of tension and the resolution of remaining international disputes in East Asia are vitally important to the maintenance of peace and security in the entire Asia and Pacific region. For the Fiji Islands and other small island countries in the South Pacific, permanent peace in the wider Asia-Pacific region has a direct bearing on our economic future. Given my country?s commitment to global peace, the Government of the Republic of the Fiji Islands strongly condemns international terrorism in all its violent forms. It is a scourge, and all States should treat it as such. My delegation urges universal condemnation of such indiscriminate acts of violence, and we pledge to cooperate with all other members of the General Assembly in preventing such acts and in bringing those responsible to justice. We welcome the recent adoption at Rome of the statute of the International Criminal Court, and we express our gratitude to the Italian Government for hosting the conference at which this took place. Last but not least, my delegation wishes to inform the Assembly that a new Constitution of Fiji was 27 promulgated on 27 July 1998. Pursuant to the coming into force of the new Constitution, the name of our country has been changed to the Republic of the Fiji Islands. An innovative feature of the new Constitution is that it makes provision for the formation of a multi-party system of Government through representation in the Cabinet of all political parties that secure a certain number of seats in Parliament. The new Constitution also makes provision for the appointment of a Human Rights Commission and a Constitutional Offices Commission. The Government of the Republic of the Fiji Islands considers the promulgation of the new Constitution as laying the foundation for meaningful change in our multiracial country. General elections under the new Constitution are due to be held next year. Change is a paradox in international relations. If we are to fashion a new and better international community in which international democracy is to prevail and in which the development and progress of all nations is to be engendered, we, collectively and in collaboration, have to inculcate change in the many issues which my delegation has enumerated. We must make meaningful change in our world an international imperative.   On behalf of the people of Rwanda and on my own behalf, allow me to convey sincere and heartfelt congratulations to you on your outstanding election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. This election reflects the unanimous recognition by States of our Organization of your country, Uruguay. A well-deserved tribute is likewise extended to your distinguished predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, who demonstrated dedication, skill and open-mindedness at the last session. Heartfelt fraternal thanks go to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his skill, performance and far- sightedness. This fifty-third session of the General Assembly is the second in his term of office. The Government and the people of Rwanda are grateful to the Secretary-General for the working visit he made to Rwanda in May 1998. That historic visit made it possible for him to take stock of the results of the genocide committed in Rwanda in 1994, and we thank him for his words of encouragement to the Government and the people of Rwanda for efforts made in the process of rebuilding the country. Each time we have had an opportunity to do so, the Government of Rwanda has supported the proposals of the Secretary-General with regard to the essential reforms of our Organization and deemed that the same proposals for reform were likewise valid for the reform of the Security Council. We are prepared to continue our contribution to and support for the collective efforts to bring about more democratization in the Security Council at the dawn of the third millennium. The existence of the specialized agencies within the United Nations has made this institution an instrument of development, particularly in the economic, social, political and cultural fields, and in many other areas. The Government of Rwanda supports the existence of the specialized agencies of the United Nations. The United Nations reform under way should take them into account in order to better structure them to be more operational. Since the 1960s, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has constantly been a source of concern to the United Nations and the international community. One United Nations Secretary-General even lost his life there in the search for a solution to the problems of that country. Today, more than in the past, this country, Congo — which has since become the Democratic Republic of the Congo — is experiencing the darkest times in its history, because genocide is being committed there on the orders of the highest authorities of that country. Since 2 August 1998, Rwanda, like everyone, has been witnessing a rebellion in the Democratic Republic of the Congo against the Government and President Kabila. Since then, the Government of Rwanda has consistently pointed out that that crisis is purely internal and that Mr. Kabila had definitely been facing a highly structured rebellion. The commission of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), composed of the four member countries Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Namibia and Zambia, acknowledged in its report to SADC, following its fact-finding mission, that a rebellion exists against Mr. Kabila in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. President Kabila himself implicitly recognized the existence of this rebellion when he published a long list of Congolese authorities that he banished by withdrawing their Congolese passports and issuing international arrest warrants against them. These Congolese were banished by President Kabila because they are leading the Congolese rebellion against him. Mr. Kabila’s implicit recognition of this rebellion was also shown when he arrested and imprisoned six journalists from the Kinshasa news agency “La Voix du Peuple” because he suspected them of supporting the Congolese rebellion. The position of Rwanda is to join its mediation efforts with those of the international community to find a solution to the Congolese crisis through negotiations between the Congolese rebels and the Government of President Kabila. Unfortunately, these efforts of the Government of Rwanda have collided with the obstinacy of President Kabila, who believes that the solution to this inter-Congolese conflict is to persecute and massacre the Banyamulenge, the Tutsi and the Rwandese living in Congo, as well as Congolese who refuse to support his grim designs. In this respect, Rwanda, like other observers near and far, is concerned at the increase in human rights violations committed by the Government of President Kabila, which is inciting the people to genocide, massacres and racial and ethnic hatred. The Government of Rwanda believes that the United Nations must condemn the genocide as well as human rights violations being committed in the Democratic Republic of the 4 Congo and take the necessary steps against the Government of President Kabila. This genocide and these human rights violations are characterized by summary executions, incitement to hatred by President Kabila and members of his Government, massive arrests, arbitrary detentions and forced disappearances. With regard to summary executions and incitement to hatred taking place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the following facts are illustrative. The present genocide and the massacres in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are similar to those that occurred in Rwanda in 1994 when the Radio Télévision Libre de Mille Collines (RTLM) was inciting people to hunt down Tutsis and their Hutu accomplices, as they were called by the radio station at the time. During the Victoria Falls Summit, which took place on 7 and 8 August 1998, President Kabila declared that those who committed genocide in Rwanda were right and were worthy of support then and now. This is tangible evidence of recruitment by President Kabila of Interahamwe militias and former members of the armed forces of Rwanda who committed genocide in Rwanda and took refuge in Congo Brazzaville, a fact recently denounced by the High Commissioner for Refugees. At that same Victoria Falls Summit, President Kabila implied that Rwanda was seeking to establish a Hima empire in the Great Lakes region. In that regard, my Government believes that that statement by President Kabila shows his racist leanings and theories, similar to those spread during the 1980s by the late President Habyarimana and his ilk, who invented this pseudo-empire to stifle the claims of Rwandese refugees who had been in exile for more than 30 years and who were beginning to vociferously reclaim their inalienable rights to unconditional return to their motherland. These, then, are the racist theories cunningly invented and orchestrated by the former President of Rwanda, Mr. Habyarimana, and his regime in order to demonize the Tutsi. Now, unfortunately, Mr. Kabila is making use of them once more to demonize not only the Tutsi but the whole of Rwanda and all its people. In that context, the Government of Rwanda requests the international community to put an end to these groundless racist theories and this campaign to demonize Rwanda and its people. President Kabila and his close collaborators are inciting the Congolese people to acts of mindless violence against any person suspected of being a rebel, any person of Tutsi origin and any person who, according to them, is in league, directly or indirectly, with the rebellion. The governmental authorities of Kinshasa are calling upon the people, through the official media, “to treat the enemy like a virus, a mosquito, a piece of garbage that must be crushed with determination and without mercy”. The Congolese Minister of Justice, who after all is supposed to be safeguarding everyone’s human rights, has said, “These Rwandans, these Tutsis, they are insects, microbes that must be methodically eradicated.” In support of the words of President Kabila, who said he would export war to Rwanda, the Congolese Minister of Health, Dr. Jean-Baptiste Nsonji, stated, “The Rwandans will become like snakes whose head and tail have been cut off, unable to move, unable to escape.” In response to these incitements to hatred and violence spread by President Kabila and the Congolese Minister of Information, Mr. Didier Mumengi, the Minister of Health, Dr. Jean-Baptiste Nsonji, and the Director of President Kabila’s cabinet, Mr. Yerodia Abdoulaye, the population has begun to attack persons suspected of being in league with the rebels. People have been burnt alive because they were caught with red mud on their shoes — red being the colour of the mud in the region of the lower part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, at that time occupied by rebels. The Government’s soldiers have fired point blank at other suspects whose bodies were abandoned in the streets. Several mentally ill people were summarily executed because of a rumour, spread by Kabila’s Government, that the rebels had disguised themselves as madmen in order to pass unnoticed. On 27 August 1998, a mentally ill person living at the corner of Kasai and Usoke streets in the town of Barumbu was riddled with bullets in the central market of Kinshasa. An unidentified person was summarily shot down because he was caught speaking on a cellular phone. Another person was executed purely and simply because he was speaking English. President Kabila’s governmental troops are using all possible means to wipe out the evidence of the atrocities they commit. Several witnesses, including some fishermen, agree that they saw human bodies carried on the waters of the Congo river. Other persons suspected of being rebels have been buried alive in Kitambo and Masina. 5 The mass arrests, arbitrary detentions and forced disappearances in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been denounced in particular by an African human rights association (ASADHO) that works in Kinshasa. The association denounced these arrests and disappearances on 10 August and 3 September 1998, and the following facts were stated by this Congolese human rights association: “Several individuals of Tutsi origin were arrested and arbitrarily detained in the Kokola and Tshatshi camps and in various jails belonging to the information service and in the Kin-Mazière jail in Kinshasa- Gombe; more than 500 soldiers from the former Zairian armed forces were arrested, and some are still missing to this day. “Other Congolese who are married to Tutsis, friends of Tutsis or who look like Tutsis have been arrested in connection with this inter-Congolese conflict. Some persons have been removed from their homes, their hotel rooms and even from the premises of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Kinshasa, as a result of curfews and various manhunt operations decreed by the Kabila Government.” All these facts are cited from that Congolese human rights association. The Rwandan Government believes, once again, that the solution to this inter-Congolese conflict lies in political negotiations between the Kabila Government and the rebels, for the following reasons. First, the Congolese must resolve among themselves, once and for all, the question of nationality and citizenship, though this is not negotiable. Normally, a question of nationality or citizenship is not up for negotiation, but we believe that this problem has to be resolved among the Congolese. Indeed, we wonder why President Kabila’s former ministers, such as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Karaha, and the Minister of State to the Presidency of the Republic, Mr. Bugera, and many other Congolese citizens from the eastern part of the country have been banished from their homes and from Congolese territory. It is Rwanda’s view that we cannot eternally have stateless people on our borders, especially the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Secondly, this inter-Congolese conflict has repercussions for the security of the neighbouring countries, particularly Rwanda, given that Kabila’s forces are a combination of all the criminal elements of the countries of the region. Security in the north of Rwanda is constantly menaced by elements of the former Rwandan Armed Forces and the Interahamwe soldiers who committed the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 and who still use Congolese territory as a rear base in order to reprise their gruesome crimes. The security of neighbouring countries must be a constant source of concern to the Government and the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo must be constantly mindful of the fact that each time the forces of evil seek to sow insecurity in a neighbouring country, the country of origin of these destabilizing forces forfeits its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Thirdly, the Congolese army should be national, not a Katangese militia composed of followers of President Kabila; the Congolese of the eastern part of the country, the Banyamulengue, the Congolese of Masisi, those of Jomba and those of Rutshuru and other eastern locales, as well as other regions of the country, should also be part of it. Fourthly, the inter-Congolese conflict will be resolved by good governance and good leadership that does not incite people to commit genocide and massacre of part of the population that it is supposed to protect. The political negotiations between the Kabila Government and the rebels must encourage the emergence of this kind of leadership, which the Democratic Republic of the Congo so urgently needs. Fifthly, the philosophy of genocide and the culture of murder that President Kabila is cultivating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with the assistance of former elements of the Rwandan Armed Forces and the Interahamwe soldiers that committed the genocide in Rwanda, as well as terrorists in the pay of either country, must be quickly eradicated from the Congolese population by a new, enlightened leadership devoted to the national cause, the cause of all Congolese without exception. We have spoken at some length on the problems of the Great Lakes region, and particularly those of the Democratic Republic of the Congo; this is necessary in view of my Government’s great esteem, respect and consideration for the fraternal people of the Congo. That is why my Government shouldered its responsibility and did its neighbourly duty to the Congolese people, inter alia by demonstrating solidarity with the fraternal people of Congo in helping it rid itself of the 32-year dictatorship of the former President Mobutu, who had bankrupted the country. 6 In its efforts to find a solution to the present crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Government of Rwanda supports political negotiations leading to the emergence of a leadership worthy to guide the Democratic Republic of the Congo to a future other than that of genocide — which, unfortunately, is the situation under the regime of President Kabila. But although President Kabila and his cronies have brought disappointment and despair to the Congolese people by sowing ethnic hatred in their country, Rwanda — which had the misfortune to be the victim of the 1994 genocide — has the right to denounce the crime against humanity that is now being perpetrated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in order to prevent it from being exported to Rwanda, as appears to be on President Kabila’s political and military agenda. We hope that the United Nations will speedily condemn the genocide being perpetrated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and will take the necessary steps to halt it before it is too late. Copies of the Dallaire fax on the genocide in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are without question to be found here in New York, at the United Nations Office at Geneva, at the European Union headquarters in Brussels and in every Western capital. In the light of the existence of the Dallaire fax, no one can claim not to have been informed in time to condemn President Kabila’s acts of genocide and those of the Interahamwe militia and the elements of the former Rwandan Armed Forces, who planned and carried out the genocide in Rwanda more than four years ago. At the very beginning of the crisis, the Congolese Minister of the Interior, Mr. Gaëtan Kakudji, quietly approached the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the High Commissioner for Human Rights and told them that unless they quickly organized the evacuation of all those who had been arrested, those people would be killed. We wonder what the United Nations did in response to that alarm sounded by a Congolese official, none other than the Minister of the Interior, who has now dissociated himself from President Kabila’s acts of genocide by abandoning his ministerial post and fleeing his country for Europe, according to information in the media. The defection of the Congolese Minister of the Interior, who is a cousin of President Kabila, may be food for thought, and perhaps for inspiration, for President Kabila’s new allies. Will they continue to support a genocidal regime that has come to be abhorred by its own people? The Governor of Shaba-Katanga province also made a discreet appeal to the United Nations and, thus, to the international community; he revealed that he had official orders to massacre all Congolese Tutsis, anyone of Rwandese origin, and any Congolese who resisted this grim plan. How did the United Nations respond to that appeal from the Governor of Shaba-Katanga province? Many people are wondering whether or not Rwanda has a presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They have, indeed, made this an overriding issue. The problem of the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of attempts to resolve it is not to find out who is and who is not in the Congo; it is to try to understand why. Why is a given actor present in the Congo? What are the real reasons for such a presence there, and why is another actor not present or even trying to be there? Why is genocide being committed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the orders of the highest authorities, including President Kabila himself? What is the meaning of the presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo of the combined genocidal forces that came from Rwanda in 1994 — the Interahamwe militia, elements of the former Rwandan Armed Forces, elements of the ex-forces of the former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin Dada, terrorists in the pay of one country or another, and other trouble-makers? Around whom and against whom are these fascist forces uniting in the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo? Will the United Nations and the entire international community wait for genocide to be committed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo before they dispatch a commission of enquiry after the event? Could not the International Criminal Court — whose recent establishment through the adoption of a suitable statute we welcome — quickly take up this matter and arrest the leader and his henchmen who are now engaged in murder in the Democratic Republic of the Congo? Those are the real questions that in our humble view should be asked about the present crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo — a crisis to which a purely political solution has to be found through political negotiations between the Government of President Kabila and the Congolese rebels.  Costa Rica is extremely pleased at Mr. Didier Operttiâs election to preside over the work of this fifty-third session of the General Assembly. We say this not just as the ritual greeting required by protocol, but as an expression of our deeply felt congratulations to a gifted citizen of the Americas and as an expression of our certainty that in this position the noble qualities you have displayed as a great jurist in the inter-American system and as the distinguished Minister for Foreign Affairs of our sister Republic of Uruguay will once again be shown. In presenting our respectful greetings to the Secretary-General, my delegation also wishes to express its sincere recognition of the enormously courageous efforts he has made in the Secretariat in favour of maintaining international peace and security, as well as his efforts to renew and modernize the United Nations. Costa Rica congratulates you, Sir, for your work and encourages you to continue in your endeavours, which do honour to Ghana and to Africa. We are approaching the twenty-first century, the third millennium of our era, at a dizzying speed. In a few years, all of us here will be men and women of the past century. Nevertheless, we have the obligation to bestow upon the new millennium a world of greater solidarity. This subject calls for reflection. What have we done so far, and most of all, what are we doing about the imminent future? What positive contributions can we make to the new horizon that is opening up in the annals of history? Undoubtedly, the very existence of the United Nations constitutes a most positive element. In 1945, this Organization emerged as a successor, on a larger scale, to the ideal of peace embodied in the League of Nations. The 51 countries represented in San Francisco aspired to build a world in which harmony would prevail and where international security would be supported by a far more solid foundation. Today, in this Hall, almost all the countries of the world are represented â€” we hope that in the near future there will be no exceptions â€” and each of them has taken upon itself the obligation to abide by the purposes and principles of the San Francisco Charter. Under the vigorous leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt, the members of the Commission on Human Rights of the Economic and Social Council worked untiringly, freely and openly discussing the subject, and trying to harmonize approaches that encompassed both Western humanism and the ancient philosophy of the East. The fruit of their efforts was the adoption, on 10 December 1948, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 26 During those bitter years, when the shadows left by the worldwide conflagration had not yet cleared, and those of the bipolar confrontation were already looming, some believed that the Declaration was a pleasant, romantic and entirely unrealistic suggestion. Others saw it, on the contrary, as our speciesâ best hope, in the conviction that international relations have ethical value only insofar as they guarantee the dignity of human beings, which is our very essence as rational creatures, through respect for our natural attributes. As the former President of Chile, Mr. Eduardo Frei Montalva once stated, the ratification of the Declaration was a demonstration of faith in peace, faith in the peoples of the world and faith in moral progress. I am proud to be able to say that Costa Rica enthusiastically supported the Declaration; since then, Costa Rica has expressed its firm belief that human rights cannot be subordinated to the interests of States. Today our country is the seat of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights, and the University for Peace of the United Nations. Throughout Costa Ricaâs history as a Member of the United Nations, it has consistently been committed to the cause of human rights, in both the international arena and the domestic sphere. On this occasion, I reiterate to the Assembly all Costa Ricaâs firm, solemn and unconditional commitment to continue fighting actively, whenever and wherever, to achieve full respect for all human rights. Today my country reaffirms that its voice will continue to be heard in all forums on behalf of the noble ethical and moral ideals that we proclaimed 50 years ago. Perhaps the most important legacy that the United Nations of the twentieth century will leave to the United Nations of the twenty-first century will be the certitude that human rights are a matter of universal concern. This conviction has allowed the broad conceptual, legal and political development of the subject of human rights. We have debated and signed pacts, conventions and protocols on increasingly specific aspects of human rights. Despite this prodigious pile of legal instruments, humanity is still very far from having inscribed human rights on its very spirit. In many aspects, the commitment to an ethic of coexistence is as absent from the events of today as it was half a century ago. Costa Rica observes with regret the instances of intolerance and violence that still persist in our world, the ethnic, religious, cultural, national, ideological or gender discrimination: the conflicts in the Balkans, the tragic wars endured by some African peoples, the situation in Afghanistan and the savagery of terrorism in various parts of the world. We are extremely concerned by the limited progress of the Middle East peace process and the increasing virulence of national extremism and religious fanaticism in certain countries. My country believes that these serious problems must be faced from an ethical standpoint, with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as the basic code for the conduct of both States and individuals. The legal validity of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is no longer debated today. However, for a long time, doubts and objections were raised as to the possibility of establishing mechanisms to guarantee it. Thanks to the efforts of many years, the United Nations now has a High Commissioner for Human Rights. My country is proud to have been one of the main sponsors of the establishment of that office. One of the most important events that has taken place this year was the successful culmination of the effort to establish an International Criminal Court. The valuable experience of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia â€” of which the Second Vice-President of Costa Rica, Judge Elizabeth Odio, is a member â€” undoubtedly contributed to strengthening the conviction on the need for a permanent court to try the most serious violations of human rights. My country embraces the adoption of the Statute of the International Criminal Court, which took place in Rome on 17 July of this year, whereby the international community rejects and condemns the most heinous crimes against our universal conscience. We are especially pleased that the Rome Conference included within its definition of crimes violations of the basic norms of international humanitarian law, applicable both to international and internal conflicts. In addition, in the light of the tragic experiences of some Latin American countries in the recent past, we are gratified by the inclusion of the legal definition of forced disappearance. I am pleased to announce that, in the coming days, I will have the honour of signing the Courtâs Statute on 27 behalf of my country, and I express Costa Ricaâs firm intention to proceed with its speedy approval and ratification. My country is convinced of the necessity to establish a commission that will prepare, before the year 2000, the essential conditions for the Statute to enter into force. Costa Rica believes that the commission should be convened as soon as possible. This year, in addition to celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, my country will celebrate another anniversary which, for Costa Ricans, is no less important: the fiftieth anniversary of the abolition of the Costa Rican army, decreed on 1 December 1948. Only 10 days later, Costa Rica adopted the Magna Carta of international ethics, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The abolition of the army was the culmination of my countryâs long anti-militaristic history. In 1866, the then President of Costa Rica, Mr. JosÃ© Mar'a Castro, stated that one of the foundations of external peace is a strict adherence to international law, among whose prescriptions, as listed by President Castro, are dignity, good faith, loyalty and frankness. Today, as then, my country believes that in order to invoke international law and aspire to be a respected and valued State without need of military support, Costa Ricaâs principal duty is to govern its domestic and international conduct by a system of values that is grounded in the fundamental rights of individuals. As a result of its historical and moral tradition, Costa Rica believes that there are no small countries when it comes to consolidating and preserving peace. Such has been Costa Ricaâs rule of conduct when it has had the opportunity, as it does now, to be a member of the Security Council. For this same reason, Costa Rica has tenaciously supported the work aimed at general disarmament, and in particular the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, and has vigorously condemned the carrying out of nuclear tests. In that regard, my country urges all those States that have not yet done so to adhere fully and unconditionally to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Because of the values that have emerged from its own experience, Costa Rica has invariably repudiated terrorism in all its manifestations, wherever and by whomever it is committed. We do not believe that there is any justification for attacks against innocent people. Likewise, we condemn those Governments that support, shelter and give assistance to those who commit or instigate terrorist acts, in clear violation of their international obligations. We believe that the international community must make special efforts to prevent and eliminate international terrorism. In this context, we stress the recent negotiations on an International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, and we urge Member States to sign it. We also trust that during this session of the General Assembly decisive progress can be made on the preparation of an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism. My delegation wishes to express how deeply pleased it is that the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction is to enter into force within six months. My country urges all those States that have not yet done so to accede to that Convention as soon as possible. We are pleased to see that in Central America â€” notwithstanding the conflicts and the turmoil that our countries faced during the last decade â€” there are signs of progress towards the elimination or substantial reduction of military expenditures. Some countries have eliminated their armed forces, and others have reduced them significantly. Costa Rica does not intend to either export or impose any models on others, but it warmly applauds the decision of these brother countries. The international community should acknowledge the specific progress that has been made in reducing military expenses by developing countries. In this spirit, Costa Rica wishes to propose the creation of a special fund for Central America, which would be established through contributions of developed countries and organizations. The idea would be that each dollar not spent on military budgets would be at least matched by contributions for social development programmes to strengthen democratic systems in our region. The Central American peace process has been one of the most successful ones of recent times. Only a decade ago, in this same Hall, we were exhausting ourselves discussing and commenting on the effects of the Central American crisis. Today, our countries rarely make the headlines of the international press. However, we would like to stress that, notwithstanding Central Americaâs huge social and economical problems, it resolutely continues to work to consolidate for its children a more dignified and freer way of life, more in accordance with the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We have 28 progressed in the areas of electoral democracy and freedom of expression. Now the time has come to consolidate participatory democracy. Therefore, at the end of this century and of the millennium, Costa Rica has begun a process of national political dialogue, with broad popular participation, in order to strengthen our more than 100-year- old democracy. The Central American countries have worked strenuously for the integration and liberalization of our economies. We have achieved important progress in our integration mechanisms and structural adjustment processes. We are participating actively in the negotiations aimed at creating a free-trade area throughout the Americas, and we continue to maintain a policy of openness and commercial links among the Latin American countries. Despite the regional efforts to redraft its economic plans and to adapt them to the world marketâs requirements, Costa Rica views with apprehension the creation of economic unions or commercial blocks that beget new discrimination against third countries. Similarly, new conditionalities in the commercial policy of the industrialized economies and the use of managed-trade mechanisms are a clear impediment to the ideal of free trade and create new inequalities of access to the world economy. At the same time, we observe that, while the global trade in raw materials and agricultural products is losing its vigour, the exchange of high-technology goods is growing stronger. This means that the portion of trade traditionally carried out by the developing countries is becoming weaker in the global context. In this regard, Costa Rica urges the opening of markets, not only of the small economies, but also of the large and industrialized economies. Costa Rica also advocates commitment to the ideal of free trade that gave birth to the World Trade Organization and respect for its rules and resolutions in order to create an international environment more propitious for developing countriesâ economic progress. Free trade encourages economic growth, and economic freedom encourages the creation of wealth within the nations. In accordance with these principles, my country undertook, in 1997, the chairmanship of the negotiating process for the free-trade zone of the Americas, and we are trying to contribute dynamically to its progress. We are also making efforts to attain fair and non- discriminatory access for Central American products to markets in the United States and the European Union â€” the regionâs principal trade partners. In both markets, our countries have been negatively affected by the diversion of trade and investment that have resulted from the granting of preferential concessions to third countries, which are displacing our main exports. We refute the neo- protectionist arguments of the groups who are trying to obstruct the access of Central American products to those markets. For this reason, we are promoting the strengthening of the Caribbean Basin Initiative in order to correct those diversions and inequities. Furthermore, we believe there should be better opportunities for our exports to the European Union through its generalized preferences system. We are also promoting tariff reduction for agricultural products in all the industrialized countries. At the same time, Costa Rica urges industrialized nations to cooperate with the efforts to strengthen the international financial institutions in order to ensure the stability of the world financial system. Institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and regional entities such as the Inter-American Development Bank must provide support to overcome the crises that cause financial instability, especially in the emerging markets. While some believe that economic profit and ethics have nothing to do with each other, experience has shown us otherwise. Capitalism without rule of law and not subject to ethical rules usually causes scourges such as the spread of drug-trafficking, the reign of organized crime and corruption. My country, like many others, has been affected by these phenomena. Mr. Miguel Angel RodrÃ­guez Echeverr'a, President of Costa Rica, is actively participating in both the fight against and the prevention of these scourges, and he gave proof of his commitment to this cause when he contributed to the success of the recent special session of the General Assembly on drug- trafficking. For Costa Rica, these struggles can be won only if they have a solid ethical foundation. Genuine ethical leadership can do more for the long-lasting and sustainable prosperity of a society than the best laws and the most detailed treaties. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not only a statement of rights, it is also a clear statement of every human beingâs duties to the community. One of the fundamental obligations of all persons is to behave fraternally with their fellow men and the environment. 29 Costa Rica has not been exempt from the problems caused by environmental degradation. However, my countryâs authorities and many organizations of our civil society are working strenuously to solve them. In a relatively short time, we Costa Ricans have achieved major progress in the task of recovering and preserving our rich biodiversity, while at the same time transforming it into a source of income. For example, Costa Rica is today one of the developing countries that has undertaken a leading role in carbon-fixation projects. We have negotiated important bilateral agreements based on the filtration capability of our forests. Those agreements have allowed us to become the first country to issue â€œsale of oxygenâ€ certificates as specific proof of the quantity of captured emissions. My country has been the recipient of important international cooperation programmes. In many areas we continue needing them. Nevertheless, we firmly believe that cooperation is a two-way street in which we can all teach and learn, give and receive. Costa Rica believes that its experience in ecological matters may be useful to many other countries and it makes it available to the international community. Furthermore, my country would like to express its firm intention to offer technical cooperation for development, in the modest measure of its capabilities, through the action of a specialized office that is being established for such a purpose. Thanks to this office, Costa Ricans will share with other nations our experiences in the areas of health, education, ecology, human rights and electoral development. For Costa Rica, the respect for diversity consecrated in the Universal Declaration must be an essential characteristic of the Member States of the United Nations. In this regard, we are always conscious of the valuable lesson of the African thinker, Salif Tall Tierno-Bokar, when he taught that the rainbow owes its beauty to the varied tones of its colours in the same way that the voices of various believers make up a harmony that rises up to divinity. The survival of the human species cannot be based on a system of separate existences. Since human beings first appeared on the face of the earth, they must have had an awareness of their individual limitations and must have understood that they could not survive without the other members of their species. Today, such natural wisdom of our far-distant ancestors continues to be valid. We must live in community in order to build the future. The concept of love for our fellow men is at the core of all religions. The ancient texts of the great masters of China, Mexico and India, and the Torah, the Gospel and the Koran, regardless of any differences, are all permeated with a deep sense of identity among individuals. Moral and spiritual perfection, the dream of so many thinkers and the innermost aspiration of so many peoples, cannot be reached without a basis in the constructive and fraternal coexistence of all the nations. At this moment in history, we the people who inhabit the earth must create a civilization of peace and solidarity. The twenty-first century should be the century of the culture of peace, which is also the culture of freedom, tolerance and solidarity.   First allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the crucial post of President of the General Assembly and to wish you success in guiding the work of this important forum. The example of Tajikistan clearly demonstrates the fruitfulness of close cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations in peacekeeping activities and highlights the need for the international community to implement a coordinated strategy to support the efforts of the Government and people of a country to resolve crises, overcome instability and find ways to achieve lasting peace, national reconciliation and prosperity. We welcome the key role played by the United Nations in coordinating this multifaceted work. I would like once again to express my profound gratitude to all Members of the General Assembly and the Security Council and to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for their growing and multifaceted support for the peace process in Tajikistan and for their overall unflagging attention to our problems, which, regrettably, remain acute. We commend the efforts of all States and international organizations that are acting as guarantors of the General Agreement on the Establishment of Peace and National Accord in Tajikistan signed on 27 June last year in Moscow and reached with the assistance of the United Nations. During the almost five years they were stationed on the territory of Tajikistan, the collective peacekeeping forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States, by their presence and practical actions, helped stabilize the situation in our country and helped us continue to pursue the complex inter-Tajik political dialogue. This has led to the implementation of the historic agreements that resulted from these talks. We express our deep appreciation to all our friends — countries and international organizations, and in particular United Nations agencies — that empathize with the people of Tajikistan in their hardships and are trying to help them overcome them as soon as possible. While paying due tribute to the United Nations for its contribution to the strengthening of peace and national reconciliation in Tajikistan, we are fully aware that the primary responsibility for restoring peaceful life in our country and for the future of our motherland lies with the leadership of the Republic of Tajikistan and with the Tajik opposition. 19 We believe that the peace process in Tajikistan, though arduous, is becoming more established and is moving towards national accord. This is born out by the fact that the work of the Commission on National Reconciliation has definitely entered a constructive phase. The majority of refugees and displaced persons have returned home. The process of reintegrating the United Tajik Opposition armed formations into the Government military structures has begun. The majority of the participants in the military and political resistance movement have been granted amnesty and released from prison. All prisoners of war have been released. Virtually all the leaders of the Opposition forces have returned to the country and are living and working in Dushanbe. Representatives of the Opposition have been appointed to a number of important Government posts. A process is under way to bring the nation’s laws up to date with the new needs of political life in Tajikistan. A number of other serious measures have also been implemented. Guided by the vital aspirations of the people and recognizing that there is no viable alternative to full and timely implementation of the Tajikistan General Agreement, the country’s leadership is determined to continue to do all it can to ensure speedy implementation of all the provisions of the General Agreement. We are grateful for the empathy for our problems shown by the former Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Tajikistan, Mr. Gerd Dietrich Merrem, who completed his work in May this year. We are prepared to build on this positive experience of cooperation in our relations with his successor, Mr. Jan Kubisz. Tajikistan has great respect for the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) and for all its staff. These brave and noble people are serving a lofty goal under difficult conditions and are making a valuable contribution to the attainment of national accord and the establishment of peace and tranquillity in our country. The Government of the Republic of Tajikistan reaffirms its desire to continue to closely cooperate with the United Nations in implementing the peace accords and in the post-conflict reconstruction of the country. We have taken decisive action to prevent excesses similar to the tragic death this past July of four UNMOT officers, and to provide better security for all personnel of international organizations present in Tajikistan. While in no way diminishing the United Nations obvious achievements in organizing collective international responses to crisis situations in various regions of the world, we feel obliged to draw attention once again to the dangerous, protracted Afghan conflict, which remains unresolved. We have particular reason for highlighting this problem — above all because we feel profound sympathy for the continuing sufferings of the fraternal people of Afghanistan. Moreover, we, together with our nearest neighbours and Russia, are very seriously concerned about the dangers posed by the situation in Afghanistan, which threatens to destabilize the entire Central Asian region; to lead to a massive and spontaneous exodus of Afghan refugees across the border into Tajikistan; and to spread terrorism, arms and drugs. We are especially alarmed about the threat of the proliferation of religious extremism, and are joining forces with Russia and Uzbekistan to counter it. Since the inter-Tajik reconciliation process has not been completed, all these factors are impacting very negatively on the situation in our country. As the history of Afghanistan shows, the use of force by any internal or external actors not only is incapable of solving the problems of Afghan society, but is fraught with the danger of a new escalation of civil war in that country. In this context, we cannot but feel alarmed at developments in Afghanistan, in particular the open disregard for the efforts of the international community to find a political solution to the conflict and for the Afghan people’s desire to preserve the integrity of their State. We, together with the other members of the Almaty Five, are closely following developments in the Islamic State of Afghanistan. Tajikistan fully supports the United Nations playing a central role in coordinating all international efforts to find an Afghan settlement. As a member of the group of neighbours and friends of Afghanistan, the Six plus Two group, we are firm in our opposition to any external interference in the affairs of Afghanistan, including interference in the form of sending military personnel and arms to that country. The Republic of Tajikistan notes the important role played by the United Nations in disarmament and in a whole range of problems related to strengthening non- proliferation regimes with regard to weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons. In this context, we are joining the initiative of our neighbours to create a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia. We believe the establishment of such a nuclear-free zone requires, first and foremost, action on the part of prospective parties to that treaty. We need to consider such questions as the 20 definitive geographical configuration of this zone; the substance and range of guarantees granted to the parties by the nuclear Powers; how to deal with any transporting of nuclear weapons through such a zone; verification measures; and other matters. Our position on the establishment of a nuclear- weapon-free zone in Central Asia cannot overlook the fact that India and Pakistan have conducted nuclear tests. We fully support the urgent appeal of the Security Council to India and Pakistan to accede to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We believe that both these countries — along with the overwhelming majority of members of the international community — must choose the path of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The evolution of the world economy today is characterized by increasing globalization and liberalization. This is reflected in the growing interdependence and greater openness of national economies and of commodity and financial markets — a development that is beginning to have both positive and negative impacts. We share the view that, in addition to national efforts to increase their economic and social potential, developing countries and those in transition need the consolidated support of the international community, including that of the United Nations and other multilateral institutions. Above all, we have in mind two things: first, the creation of favourable international conditions so as to provide open access to markets, as well as to financial resources and modern technology; secondly, assistance in overcoming poverty, protecting the environment, implementing economic reforms and enhancing the competitiveness of national enterprises. Unless we resolve these problems, it will be impossible to fully integrate countries in transition into the world economy. For Tajikistan those matters are all the more relevant given that our country has many outstanding problems caused by the prolonged period of military confrontation, as well as challenges directly related to its peaceful settlement. They include the humanitarian needs of rather large and vulnerable segments of the country’s population — needs for food, medicine and health care. Vital infrastructure, in particular for water supply and sanitation, needs to be rehabilitated. And, finally, assistance is needed to help refugees and displaced persons return home, and to demobilize and reintegrate the Tajik Opposition fighters into civilian life. The leadership of Tajikistan is doing all it can to deal with the country’s humanitarian crisis caused by the internal conflict, to rebuild the basic elements of the national economy and to make progress in transforming it into a socially oriented market economy. However, these efforts will be insufficient without the assistance of many countries and international organizations, including the humanitarian agencies of the United Nations system and the charitable funds. In this regard, we note in particular the work of the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Tajikistan, who is responsible for coordinating international aid to Tajikistan for its post- conflict reconstruction and further sustainable development. We hope that at this fifty-third session there will be broad support for a resolution that fully reflects Tajikistan’s needs at this difficult stage in its development, including the tasks related to implementation of the General Agreement on the Establishment of Peace and National Accord in our country. We have gratefully acknowledged the consolidated appeal drawn up by United Nations agencies to meet the humanitarian needs of the Tajik people for 1998. This appeal clearly defined the priorities and set the minimum amount of external aid required. We would be grateful to donors if, reflecting the spirit of support for the peace process in Tajikistan expressed at the Vienna meeting of donors in October last year and at the Paris conference held in May this year, they would meet the goals of this appeal. We attach great importance to continuing our cooperation with institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which are seeking to provide assistance during the post-conflict reconstruction and development of the Tajik economy. We hope that in the near future this cooperation will further expand. Tajikistan consistently supports various United Nations efforts to protect the environment. As a predominantly mountainous country, Tajikistan sees particular relevance in increasing the attention paid by the international community to the preservation of biological diversity and natural mountain ecosystems. In this connection, we actively supported the proposal of the Kyrgyz Republic to declare the year 2000 the 21 International Year of the Mountain. We were one of the co- sponsors of the relevant draft resolution, which we hope will be adopted by consensus at this session. We are inspired and encouraged by the growing interest of the United Nations in helping to solve the environmental problems faced by our country and other countries of Central Asia. In our view, one of the most serious ecological challenges posed not only to Tajikistan but to almost all the countries of the region is to eliminate the potential threat of the major natural disasters that could occur if no effective action is taken to normalize the situation in the area of Lake Sarez, which lies 3,263 metres above sea level and contains 17 billion tonnes of water. This poses a grave danger not only for the people of Tajikistan but also for neighbouring Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan, which could sustain serious damage in the event of a breakage of the natural dam that was formed at the beginning of this century as a result of an earthquake. We count on our renewed cooperation with the United Nations for help in dealing with this problem in a comprehensive manner. Among the many problems on the United Nations agenda, we would like to stress the issue of combating the drug menace, whose deleterious impact, unfortunately, has not bypassed our country. We fully support the coordinating role of the United Nations in the mobilization of the international community’s efforts in this area. We note the usefulness and timeliness of the convening in June this year of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to this issue. Tajikistan, together with its closest neighbours, is taking active steps to halt illicit drug trafficking. It is broadening its cooperation with the United Nations International Drug Control Programme. As is well known to those who have observed the situation in one of our neighbouring countries, “narcodollars” create fertile soil for terrorism and illicit drugs and arms trafficking. We view terrorism in all its forms and manifestations as a grave crime against humanity. The Government of the Republic of Tajikistan vigorously condemns the acts of violence that have been committed recently in certain countries. We call upon the United Nations and its Members to declare merciless and uncompromising war on terrorism all over the world. Tajikistan supports the steps being taken by the Secretary-General to reform the entire United Nations system to enable it to serve better in a new environment, and to deal with different issues without undermining the foundation of its activities. This point must be taken into account when dealing with expansion of the membership of the Security Council, so that this important body can continue effectively and expeditiously to discharge its primary responsibility under the United Nations Charter: the maintenance of international peace and security. We are confident that the joint efforts of Members to reform the Organization will lead to a renewal which will preserve its universal character and its ability to adequately meet current and future challenges. Mankind is increasingly feeling the winds of the twenty-first century. What they bring depends on all of us, on whether or not we succeed in responding collectively to new challenges and in establishing a reliable system of international security and stability once we have overcome the vices, antagonisms and stereotypes accumulated during the century about to end. This is not only possible, it is the imperative of our times! A well-known Russian proverb says, â€œIf you would live in the world, live in peaceâ€. It contains a highly philosophical message of everlasting value. Mankind will live in peace and harmony once it has learned to resolve emerging problems through peaceful, political means. States will live in peace and harmony once they have recognized their interrelationship and interdependence and started to seek collective responses to the challenges of their times. Experience confirms the truth of this popular wisdom. The most recent example is the sharp aggravation of the world monetary and financial crisis which has besieged many countries, including Russia, which is undergoing sweeping economic reforms. The current upheaval in the world financial markets can be overcome only by joint efforts that do not pursue unilateral advantages and are intended to ensure global economic stability. Interaction of States in this process, including within the framework of the United Nations, must, on principle, be raised to a new level. As for Russia, after overcoming an acute political crisis, the countryâs President, Boris N. Yeltsin, the Government and the leading political forces are making vigorous efforts to stabilize the economic and financial situation. This is not an easy task, but the solution will be found. From this rostrum I pledge that Russia will not deviate from the path of reform and will do its best to pass with dignity this most difficult test, so as not only to preserve the democratic progress that has been made but also to augment it. Likewise, Russiaâs foreign policy will remain consistent and constructive. It is firmly geared towards building a democratic multipolar world, ensuring interaction with other States in the interests of settling international problems by political means and developing broad, mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas. 20 We are convinced that the problems before the world, no matter how complex they may be, can be solved on the basis of strict observance of international law and close interaction among States. Multilateral organizations and mechanisms have a special role to play in this respect. Above all, this applies to the United Nations, which continues to be the sole universal international peacekeeping organization and is thus better equipped than any other world body to reach agreements on how to settle conflicts, as well as to identify and remove the underlying social and economic causes. It is important for United Nations efforts to be reinforced by support from regional organizations. We highly value the level of interaction that now exists between the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), acting as a reliable partner in addressing complex European problems, as well as interaction with the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and other regional organizations, including the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The international community has developed a unique arsenal of political and diplomatic tools intended for the resolution of every international problem. It must be put to effective use. Coercive actions constitute exceptional methods of last resort. Their use must be strictly regulated by the rules of international law and above all by the United Nations Charter. In other words, we advocate invoking the force of law rather than the law of force in international affairs. The fact that the Iraqi crisis which erupted earlier this year was settled precisely by political means, through the joint efforts of many States and the initiatives launched by the United Nations Secretary-General, provided graphic evidence that the potential inherent in constructive and active diplomacy is by far more efficient than relying exclusively on military force. A new outbreak of tensions around Iraq has made us deeply concerned, since it is fraught with serious consequences for regional and international stability. No doubt Iraq must fully travel its part of the road, resume full cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and implement relevant Security Council resolutions. On the other hand, the Security Council must adequately assess the situation related to the elimination of Iraqâs weapons of mass destruction and answer the question of whether or not that country still poses a threat to regional and overall international security after seven years of work carried out there by United Nations inspectors. Concerted action by the world community is required today to finally unblock this crisis situation. Political logic must prevail over the logic of force in our search for ways to settle the explosive conflict in Kosovo. The use of tools of coercion to resolve the Kosovo conflict might lead to a major war with unpredictable consequences for the Balkan region and Europe at large. It is our firm belief that a political solution is the only possible way of settling the problem of Kosovo, granting it broad autonomy and ensuring strict respect for the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The bloodshed in Afghanistan continues in spite of the fact that, as experience has shown, only temporary gains can be obtained in that country through the use of arms. Rather, it is only through a persistent search for political solutions, with the United Nations playing a central role, that genuine stabilization, real settlement, formation of an efficient central Government recognized by all Afghans and, finally, assurance of Afghanistanâs territorial integrity and independence can realistically be accomplished. Collective political efforts are required to give a second wind to the Middle East peace process. In our view, it is not so much the absence of fresh ideas or proposals but rather the upsetting of the balance that has stymied progress on all the negotiating tracks. It should not be ignored that even if the Middle East process has long-term objectives, it also has its time limits. Russia has consistently advocated the establishment of an independent Palestinian State through political means and negotiations. It is only in this way that the inalienable rights of the Palestinians to self-determination and reliable assurance of Israelâs legitimate security interests can be realized. In a parallel move, talks must be resumed on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, building on the results already achieved. The recently proposed settlement of the Lockerbie case has been a major accomplishment of the international community. The adoption by the Security Council of a relevant resolution was possible due to the constructive approach taken by the parties concerned â€” the United States, Great Britain, France and Libya â€” as well as due to diplomatic efforts by many international organizations, which were supported by Russia. It is essential to proceed without delay to its implementation. 21 Arguably, similar perseverance must be shown in the efforts to break the deadlock in the Cyprus settlement. The United Nations must play a leading role to this end. Failure of the international community to fully extinguish any one of the long-standing local conflicts in Africa in recent years is a source of growing concern. Moreover, new flash points of tension have emerged on that continent. It must be admitted that so far attempts to achieve full coordination between the United Nations and Africaâs regional organizations have not succeeded. That is why the upcoming Security Council ministerial meeting on Africa should focus on shaping a strong common stance capable of radically reversing the negative dynamics of Africaâs latest developments. For objective reasons, Russia has paid special attention to settlement of conflict situations in the CIS. Whether in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Tajikistan or Trans-Dniestria, our country has but one objective â€” namely, promoting a political settlement and helping build lasting peace. As requested by the sides concerned, Russia has undertaken a difficult peace-building mission and is doing all it can to bring it to fruition. But the effort can prove unavailing unless the parties in conflict show goodwill and a constructive attitude and also receive more meaningful international backing, above all from the United Nations and the OSCE. While making strong efforts to settle regional crises, we should not lose sight of global problems, some of which have acquired a new dimension in the last year. We cannot but feel concerned over the emergence of a real threat in the form of the proliferation of nuclear weapons throughout the planet. It is a common task of the international community to encourage all countries to accede both to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty. We welcome Brazilâs accession to the Non- Proliferation Treaty. Russia is committed to the idea of continued reduction of nuclear weapon arsenals and the maintenance of strategic stability at lower armament levels. In this context, we attach particularly great importance to the Russian- American interaction in the area of reducing strategic offensive arms. In the course of his appointment hearings, Mr. Yevgeny M. Primakov, Chairman of the Russian Government, expressed his firm resolve a few days ago to seek early ratification by the State Duma of the START II Treaty. Likewise, it is important for the United States to ratify all documents related to START II. Accession of the other nuclear Powers to the nuclear arms control process is now on the agenda. We urge careful consideration of a proposal made by President Boris Yeltsin that calls on the nuclear Powers to deploy nuclear weapons exclusively within the boundaries of their national territories. We note with satisfaction the recent consensus decision in the Conference on Disarmament to start negotiations banning production of nuclear-weapon-grade fissionable materials. What is of special significance is that the decision was supported by States that are not yet parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, among others. We are convinced that such a ban would be a further necessary step in multilateral efforts to enhance the non-proliferation regime and nuclear disarmament. The nuclear threat has many faces. Today, nuclear terrorism can also be a source of that threat. What seemed to be science fiction yesterday can now, much to our regret, become a reality. Hence, strong action by the international community is required to prevent the real- life emergence of that new form of terrorism. Accelerating work on a draft convention to combat acts of nuclear terrorism, submitted by our country so that it can be adopted by the General Assembly at the current session, has become particularly relevant. Russia has repeatedly stated at the highest level its firm opposition to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. International terrorism is one of the most dangerous global challenges to international stability. It can be successfully combated only through united action by all States. Indeed, only by acting together instead of making unilateral power moves, shall we be able to succeed in our fight against that most dangerous of evils. Militant separatism has become another factor that destabilizes international relations. Relying exclusively on extremist methods in the struggle for the national rights of minority groups within multinational States, separatism often finds itself in league with terrorism and religious fanaticism. Separatism inevitably provokes internal conflicts in which neighbouring countries frequently get involved, thereby setting the stage for stoking regional crises. More than two and a half thousand national minorities live in 150 countries of the world. Were all of them to aspire to a State entity of their own, the disastrous and catastrophic consequences could easily be imagined. Those who foment separatism should keep that in mind. 22 The fight against drugs also requires joint, concerted action. We must focus on the practical implementation of the relevant decisions aimed at combating the drug threat adopted by the General Assembly at its special session. The international community should take a common stand in implementing the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, whose fiftieth anniversary occurs this year. In this area, too, resolute joint action is needed in respect of those States which, under various pretexts, violate generally recognized human rights and freedoms. There can be no tolerance of double standards involving attempts to shield those who elevate to the level of Government policy discrimination against a part of the population. Russia cannot and will not remain indifferent to the fate of hundreds of thousands of Russian-speaking citizens subjected to harsh repressive measures in Latvia and Estonia. The international community, and above all the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, should closely watch the situation in those countries. I have touched upon a few of the important issues which the United Nations is called upon to deal with at this time. It continues to play its unique role as facilitator of joint efforts by States to strengthen peace and security, deal with urgent issues and meet new global challenges. To that end, it is necessary to improve United Nations mechanisms and adapt them to todayâs needs. That is exactly what the process of reforming the United Nations, launched by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, seeks to accomplish. The rationale behind it is enhanced efficiency for the Organization. That is the angle from which we approach the ongoing discussion on the work of the Security Council. No one should question the Security Councilâs primary responsibility under the Charter for the maintenance of peace and security. It is extremely important to preserve its effectiveness and its efficiency in decision-making, as well as to build on internal cohesion and work coordination methods developed in recent years. I should like to reaffirm that we support the implementation of reforms and changes in United Nations mechanisms that will promote effective consolidation of the United Nations and improve its activities. Among the steps taken to that end I wish to mention adoption, under United Nations auspices, of the Statute of the International Criminal Court. Russiaâs initiative to launch a discussion on ways to achieve international information security serves the same goal. In essence, our proposal is intended to offset threats inherent in the use of the latest advances in science and technology for purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security. I wish to single out a dangerous tendency: that of adapting the United Nations to meet the requirements of an individual State, or of replacing it altogether as, for example, in the case of peacekeeping. What I have in mind are attempts to undercut the powers of the Security Council, as laid down in the Charter, to use coercive measures. We must not allow a precedent to be created involving the use of military potential in a crisis situation without the consent of the Security Council. Surely it is obvious that such actions could lead to a serious erosion of the existing system of international relations, whose central element is the United Nations. United Nations sanctions as an instrument of international coercion also require a highly balanced approach. When introduced by the Security Council, sanctions should not become a tool to fight a regime that may be disliked. Sanctions should not make people suffer. They should not destabilize the economic situation in the country subjected to sanctions or in the adjacent region. It is time to fine-tune the mechanism regulating the imposition of sanctions and their duration and the procedures for easing and lifting them. In short, individual elements of the United Nations mechanism need improvement and retooling. But we should go about it with a full sense of responsibility, mindful of the medical professionâs rule that unnecessary harm is to be avoided at all costs. Every session of the General Assembly is, in a way, a milestone event. Each session is expected to make a tangible contribution to the resolution of acute problems confronting mankind. It will depend on all of us whether or not the fifty-third session of the General Assembly lives up to the expectations and hopes we place in it. It will depend on all of us whether or not joint effective steps are taken to lead us to a more stable, peaceful world, a world free from war and conflict and from financial and economic upheaval, a world built on the principles of democracy and multi-polarity. Russia stands ready to work with others to attain these goals.  I wish to welcome at the outset the President of the General Assembly at its fifty- third session. He has assumed a difficult and important task, and we have full confidence in his ability to give this body the direction required at a time when many complex issues are on its agenda. I would like to pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has continued to represent our Organization in an outstanding manner and to whom we are all indebted for initiating a comprehensive reform process. His presentation of the report on the work of the Organization at the beginning of the general debate has provided us with a clear picture of where the United Nations stands today and of the major issues we must address. We remain committed to the reform process and hope that the ongoing changes will bring about the urgently needed improvement in the financial situation of the Organization. We share the Secretary-General?s deep concern at the deterioration of the security situation of United Nations personnel involved in field operations and the view that determined action by the General Assembly is needed to address this problem, which poses a threat to many core activities of the United Nations. On the positive side, we share the satisfaction felt at the entry into force of the Convention on the Prohibition of Anti- personnel Mines next spring and are pleased to announce that Liechtenstein will deposit its own instrument of ratification very soon. After a series of major conferences in the first half of this decade, we now have to tackle the important task of addressing the follow-up processes to these major events, in order to ensure that the relevant final documents are implemented on the national and international levels and thus translated into concrete action for the benefit of people worldwide. This year, we celebrate both the adoption of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action five years ago and the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, which is usually referred to as the 32 “50 plus 5” anniversary. We hope this event will send a powerful message to the world that the United Nations and its Member States are aware of the need for genuine and effective national policies and international cooperation in order to achieve the standards established in this area by the United Nations. The Universal Declaration constitutes a milestone in the history of human rights activities of the United Nations and the basis for the remarkable achievements made over the following years and decades. Therefore, it is our view that on 10 December we should reaffirm in strong and clear terms the contents of this Declaration, as well as our commitment to fully implement its provisions, in order to ensure that all individuals worldwide benefit from the standards set out in the Declaration. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action have been a key element in the human rights deliberations for half a decade now. The value and importance of this document have become very clear during this period of time, while the implementation of many of its contents has been slow and not satisfactory. The Vienna document is complementary to the previously existing instruments and standards in the field of human rights. Our main task is to ensure that these high-quality standards under international law are made a reality in daily life for people worldwide, since there continues to be a very noticeable deep gap between these standards and their implementation in practice. I am pleased to announce that the Liechtenstein parliament has approved accession to the International Covenants on Human Rights, as well as to the protocols to the second Covenant. We fully subscribe to the principle that all human rights are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and have thus to be treated on the same footing. There is, however, one area to which we would like to give particular emphasis, namely, the promotion and protection of the rights of children, which warrant our special attention. The scope and number of violations of the rights of the child are particularly disturbing, and we are grateful to note that the international community has in the recent past stepped up its efforts to combat some of the most outrageous forms of such violations. Another welcome and necessary measure is the appointment of a Special Representative of the Secretary-General on children in armed conflicts. We pledge our full support to the activities undertaken by Mr. Olara Otunnu and express our hope that his office will be provided with the necessary human and financial resources to fulfil its far-reaching and complex tasks. We are disappointed that it has not yet been possible to adopt an optional protocol on children in armed conflicts, which could make a major contribution in this respect. A very important and timely impetus to the cause of human rights and international humanitarian law was provided by the adoption of the Statute of an International Criminal Court this summer in Rome. While the International Criminal Court is not a human rights court, we consider the Rome Statute to be a very important contribution to Human Rights Year. We welcome the outcome of the Rome Conference as an achievement of truly historic dimensions and — like the Ottawa process — as an example of the fruitful role civil society can play in an intergovernmental negotiating process of high complexity. While we would have preferred to give the International Criminal Court more far-reaching competence, we are very satisfied and encouraged to note that what seemed like a dream just a few years ago now has a chance to become a reality. It is of crucial importance to realize that the adoption of the statute was not the end of the process, but, rather, a decisive step which requires determined follow-up and further hard work from all of us. Constructive and serious work in the Preparatory Commission and a speedy process of signature and ratification are the most important tasks for the imminent future, and we hope that the General Assembly will send out a strong message to this end. As a participant in the Rome Conference and as one of the first signatories of the Statute, Liechtenstein stands ready to make its contribution. One of the most disturbing developments in the past year took place in the field of nuclear non-proliferation. Liechtenstein continues to condemn all nuclear tests and has expressed its concern at the impact of the tests conducted this year on political stability in the region concerned. This matter touches on the very existence of humankind, and thus we have to make every effort to create a non-proliferation regime which is just, effective and credible. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) of 1968 and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty of 1996 constitute, if fully implemented, two cornerstones of such a regime. Other measures will be necessary, and it is of crucial significance that all countries stand ready to make their contribution to solving this issue in the interest of all of us. Our own region has been affected by the crisis in the former Yugoslavia for many years now. We all welcomed the conclusion of the Dayton Agreements, because they 33 brought an end to the terrible suffering of the people in the former Yugoslavia. We remain concerned, however, at the slow process of implementation, especially with regard to the civilian aspects of the Agreements. The year 1998 has brought about a new crisis of alarming dimensions: the conflict in Kosovo. Liechtenstein condemns the numerous and serious violations of international humanitarian law in this conflict and remains very concerned about the situation of the civilian population and the potential impact of the developments in Kosovo on regional stability. Preventing a further deterioration of the humanitarian situation and finding a viable political solution are the two most important issues for a solution to the Kosovo crisis, which poses a clear threat to international peace and security and should therefore be dealt with appropriately by the United Nations. It has become clear once again that the capacity of our Organization to deal with such challenges needs to be enhanced and improved. As with other crises in the recent past, most notably the one in Rwanda, the outbreak of violence in Kosovo came as a surprise to nobody, and yet not enough was done to prevent it. Further developing the concept of prevention and translating it into concrete action remains, therefore, in our view, one of the most important issues on the agenda of the United Nations, and the increased involvement of women in preventive diplomacy continues to be of particular importance to us. We note with gratitude the signs of an increased political will to support the concept of prevention, while we believe that more concerted and determined efforts to this end have to be made. We are ready to make our contribution, and I would like to recall in this context once again our initiative on the right of self-determination. We are more convinced than ever that a more innovative and flexible application and implementation of this right has great potential to defuse tensions and prevent conflicts within States — the type of conflicts with which the international community is most commonly faced these days. A genuine political dialogue between central Governments and communities living within States lies at the heart of our ideas, the ultimate goal of which is the prevention of tendencies by such communities to claim statehood and attempt to achieve this goal through violent means. The Liechtenstein Research Programme on Self- determination, conducted at Princeton University, has continued and increased its activities over the past year, and we have noted with great satisfaction and gratitude the interest and contributions from a large number of permanent missions in New York. We will continue to try and enhance political support for our ideas, which we hope can make a contribution to the effectiveness of our Organization in the future.  Please allow me to extend to you, Sir, my delegation?s sincere congratulations on your election to preside over the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. I wish you all the best in carrying out your duties. Let me also express my appreciation for his excellent work to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session. As of today 462 days remain until the end of this century — a century which has recorded many phases in the development of the world. There have been times of confrontation and times of partnership, times of protectiveness and times of openness. Seven years ago the walls of separation between the nations of East and West were torn down, creating opportunities for closer cooperation and economic integration. This also opened doors for nations to promote general welfare, mutual understanding and respect and the building of trust and confidence in one another. As has been said about this moment in history, it is not so much that the borders between States are now open and can be freely crossed, but that they can be transcended. Distances and borders now have limited significance; the globe has become a universal village in its own right. Today, the world economy appears to be sliding into a deep crisis. The countries that are suffering the most are the poorest. While I realize that globalization entails risks and challenges for economies and societies, I am convinced that there is no alternative. The only credible formula for a viable global economy is the promotion of freer trade through the abolition of trade barriers and the pursuit of sustained economic and democratic reform. Once starting on this path of reform, as difficult as it may be, there can be no stepping aside for shortsighted political consideration. Estonia?s success is living proof of this. Along with many other States, Estonia began its transition from a Communist regime to democracy and from a State-controlled economy to a free market in 1991. By 1997, Estonia had the highest economic growth rate in Europe, and preliminary figures for 1998 indicate that growth continues to be strong. Estonia?s inclusion among the six countries to begin accession negotiations with the European Union is a recognition of its achievements in building a civil society and a well-functioning market economy. In my country, we are proud of the European Union invitation. We regard the European integration process as among the most challenging yet most rewarding endeavours for our continent, today and in the distant future. European integration is not simply an effort to provide our citizens with the tools for success in a globalizing world; it is also a catalyst for greater openness throughout the continent. We are convinced that pursuing membership is in itself a strong guarantee for stable development, as it provides all applicants with a viable road map to reform. Estonia greatly appreciates the help provided by the United Nations, other international organizations and a number of bilateral donors during the difficult early years of transition. Now that Estonia has entered into the post- transitional stage of its development, we believe it is time to start paying back. During the last eight years our Government and people have accumulated a wealth of experience and know-how on transition to a market democracy. We want to share this knowledge with countries at an early stage of their reforms, starting from building up a well-functioning border guard and finishing with successful monetary reform. Learning how to teach and provide support is the final lesson before graduation, and this should be the goal of every reform country. At any one time, there are 15 or 16 armed conflicts from around the world on the Security Council?s agenda. Conflicts between and within States spread from Europe to Africa, from the Middle East to Asia. These conflicts are often driven by poor socio-economic conditions or ethnic nationalism. Estonia, recognizing the primary role of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security, supports efforts to maintain and strengthen the Organization?s capacity to organize and effectively conduct its peacekeeping operations. In addition, we trust that the phasing out of gratis personnel, as mandated by the General Assembly, if handled properly, will not adversely affect the functioning of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. As a contributor of personnel, Estonia is committed to continuous participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations. We are preparing to dispatch the joint Estonian- Latvian-Lithuanian battalion known as BALTBAT for its inaugural tour of duty in the near future. I would like to extend our thanks to all nations which have supported the establishment and formation of BALTBAT. Estonia also intends to continue its involvement in Bosnia and Herzegovina within the United Nations International Police Task Force (IPTF). As a conflict 31 prevention measure, it welcomes and supports the enhanced cooperation of the United Nations with regional organizations or arrangements. In particular, deeper cooperation with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has great potential. This year has already provided the international community with a number of landmark events. Among notable achievements were the twentieth special session, on the reduction and prevention of the illicit production, sale and demand of narcotic substances, and the adoption of the Statute of the International Criminal Court. Estonia trusts that this fifty-third session of the General Assembly will reinforce the momentum captured in June and July in both New York and Rome, respectively. On the other hand, the world community has witnessed a number of vicious terrorist attacks. It is time for everybody to understand a basic fact: terrorism is not politics; it is not religion — it is murder. Estonia deplores all terrorist activities wherever they occur, whatever the form or manifestation. We sympathize with all nations that have suffered these acts and call for even stronger solidarity to fight against such attacks. We also must acknowledge that even on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, one of the major accomplishments of our Organization, the world is still home to gross violations of human rights on all six continents. We therefore call for a sustained effort of the General Assembly, in close cooperation with regional organizations, to address this issue and to find the most effective mechanisms for early warning to identify and stop these violations. Finally, a few words concerning the United Nations reform. We support reform based on the proposals by the Secretary-General. Estonia strongly believes that the aim of this reform must be to come to grips with a changing world as well as the principle of cost-effectiveness.I congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly, a sure guarantee of the success of the fifty-third session. At the same time, I wish to thank your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his fine job in handling the difficult issues that arose last year. On the broader issues facing the General Assembly in the year to come, Italy associates itself with and supports the statement made on Tuesday by the Foreign Minister of Austria on behalf of the European Union. Fewer than 10 years have gone by since the euphoric days that surrounded the fall of the Berlin Wall. As our decade began, “a new world order” was on everyone’s lips. Many believed that we were at the threshold of a new age of stability, freedom and prosperity. In the ensuing years, we have indeed witnessed rapid growth in the world economy, but we have also seen an outbreak of new forms of nationalism, ethnic hostilities and acts of aggression. Our peoples have grown apprehensive about the future as they watch the performance of the stock market, internal instability in various regions of the world, the failure of financial institutions, the rise and unpredictability of terrorism, unchecked waves of immigration, the constant flow of refugees and the resurgence of misplaced nuclear ambitions. In some countries, a few short months of crisis was all it took to wipe out the gains of an entire generation. Such crises shed light on an improper balance between the power of the market and the power of institutions. Globalization and liberalization certainly have great merits. They have forced the national political classes to set public finances in order and to promote economic efficiency. But a global market requires some measure of global government built on the knowledge that the wealth of single States cannot be separated from the welfare of the international community, a government whose strength rests on the democracy of institutions. As Secretary-General Kofi Annan underlined in his speech, globalization requires good government. This is why we urgently need to strengthen international leadership. The institutions are still not strong enough to provide such leadership, restore confidence, introduce change, stabilize the global economy, guarantee growth and protect the most vulnerable of us in the race towards development. Technology, communications and the market are progressing at a much faster pace than politics and institutions, thus creating a widening gap. In the final years of this century, our challenge is to strengthen institutions and their capacity to coordinate the action of Governments. Globalization has impacts on ideologies and behaviour, societies and institutions. The opening of markets to competition must be accompanied by reaffirmed cooperation among the largest possible number of States. The burden of responsibility falls on the shoulders of the stronger nations, particularly those of the G-7. They have a duty to show solidarity, transforming their privileges into benefits for all humanity. The system of international institutions has the United Nations as its paramount and most authoritative benchmark. The United Nations must be the driving force behind a review of the network of interdependence. Like industrialization in its early days, globalization produces both great progress and dangerous imbalances. Thus, it requires governance. No one country can govern it, however great its political, economic and military power. Our century is drawing to a close with a revitalization of institutions upon which we can build the three pillars of stability: prosperity, security and respect for fundamental freedoms. The first pillar of stability is governance of the economy to prevent crises from degenerating into catastrophes. The time has come to perfect the rules of conduct that guide the development of the global market. 19 While these rules are imperfect and not always respected, we must assert the conviction that it is important and appropriate to observe them. This is the secret of their success. It is up to the economically stronger countries to guarantee continuity in the development of the market. They must be buyers, lenders and the final guarantors if we are to instil confidence and forestall the threat of a global recession. The forces that drive the global economy are the same as those that uphold the fundamental freedoms: the circulation of information and ideas; open borders and societies; the rule of law and individual rights. The challenges facing the economy are the same as those facing freedom. At times, the markets are driven by a short-term logic that privileges the earnings of today over the growth of tomorrow. They conduct constant but instant referendums. The stock market does not always move at the same pace as the economy and society. Relentless technological progress can lead to the exclusion of many from the world of employment. Recent major economic and financial crises show that the market does not always grow when the State shrinks. Rather than enhancing freedom, sometimes it only increases the power of the strongest. It is a dangerous illusion to think the economic sphere can be unhinged from the political system, the social context and the history of nations. There can be no healthy economy without a strong State, without the rule of law, without social cohesiveness and protections — in other words, without respect for peoples or awareness of their history. The market’s supporters should not turn into the standard bearers for a new fundamentalism. The international financial institutions must know how to couple theory and practice, how to avoid strategies that damage society and destabilize the political system for the sake of defending the market. They must initiate policies and reforms that minimize moral hazards in their rescue operations. They must look at society as a whole and not just at its financial dimensions. Otherwise, some will rebel against or flee the market. The United Nations and the international community can rely on the new cohesiveness of the European Union. The European currency, the Euro, demands new responsibilities at the international level as a repository of value and as an investment and reserve currency. It will allow the Union to project abroad standards that it would not otherwise be able to preserve, such as stability, competition and social solidarity. The European Union has no intention of hiding behind the shield of its currency. It has no illusions of being an oasis of prosperity sheltered from the tempests of the world. The politicians of Europe are the first to have rethought the limits of national sovereignty. Today, the European Union, in the wake of the single currency, is about to become a political subject, and to participate as such in world leadership, to correct the fragility of the complex systems that govern the world. It is not enough to have strong national powers. For the European Union, too, the time has come to be a “leading nation”. The time has come to further enhance the rules that have allowed us to unite the continent, banishing war within our borders. To the South, Europe is facing massive waves of immigration. Europe is well aware of the needs that drive to its shores so many people trying to escape from suffocating demographic trends. Europe knows that the only solution is an ambitious policy of solidarity and development. Otherwise, like King Canute, it would be trying to hold back the sea with a wave of its hand. Our cooperation policies must be revitalized to help close the gap between North and South. The Economic and Social Council, whose presidency will be assumed by Italy at the start of the coming year, can be instrumental in eradicating poverty and harmonizing the differences between and the needs of the two hemispheres. Renewed institutions will also have to manage the second pillar of stability: security. Here, too, the United Nations must play a central role. I refer not only to its traditional role of direct involvement in peacekeeping operations. Italy, I would underline, continues to provide a strong logistic base, as well as men and resources, for such missions and has long proposed ways to make these operations more efficient and effective. I refer also to the novelty of the future: growing relations with other institutions, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), to which the transatlantic community entrusts its defence. The Atlantic Alliance is redefining its strategies, missions and membership, but it is also rethinking its relations with the United Nations in a new spirit. It is looking to the United Nations for additional legitimacy to broaden the scope of its mission. This is another crucial aspect of the system of institutions that can guarantee peace and stability and on which we must build our future. 20 Peace is also jeopardized by resurgent temptations to brandish nuclear weapons in an effort to restore regional balances, enhance national prestige and consolidate national unity. While such goals can be in themselves legitimate, they become totally illusory if entrusted to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, instruments that threaten the very right to life. In the framework of institutional strengthening, we must, as a matter of priority, root out senseless ambitions that rely on lethal weapons. We must aim instead to complete the non-proliferation regime and make it more effective and more universal. Security is jeopardized by a breed of terrorism that has become more and more irrational, threatening fragile peace processes, privatizing terror and directing its hatred mostly, but not exclusively, against the Western world and the values it represents. We must therefore redouble our common efforts to fight this scourge. Individual rights are the third component of institutional strengthening, along with prosperity and security. The market and fundamental freedoms, as we increasingly discover, are two sides of the same coin. But human rights are likely to remain abstract or illusory if the United Nations cannot enforce them to the benefit of all individuals and, if necessary, also against their Governments. The international community, and all of us individually, must deepen our commitment to safeguard these rights. The measure of our civilization is the protection we afford to the weakest and most vulnerable social groups. I am thinking first of children who are victims of atrocities whose true dimensions the media is only now beginning to expose. The Rome Statute to establish the International Criminal Court represents what is probably the greatest institutional advancement since the San Francisco Charter. In this field, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights, it confers certainty and universality on the Charter’s system of values. But here, too, we must complete our journey. Therefore, I urge those countries that have not yet done so — and they are the majority — to sign the Statute and to start to move towards prompt ratification. The core of every reform touches on the Security Council. It is not enough to strengthen institutions: we must make them more democratic and representative. And it is on the concepts of democracy and representation that the debate over the future of the Security Council pivots. Significant progress has been made in recent months in identifying measures aimed at improving the transparency and the working methods of the Security Council: greater openness of informal consultations; more involvement of countries that contribute troops to peacekeeping operations and multilateral forces; more prompt and detailed briefings on the Council’s activities by the President-in-office; and ready availability of texts and documents being examined by the Council. But the stalemate continues on the issue of enlarging the Council. The Italian Government will be willing to support any reasonable formula, provided that it does not prejudice the eventual establishment of a common European seat on the Council, distance Italy from the other principal industrial countries or increase the number of countries that are “more equal” than others, transforming the majority of Member States from protagonists into mere spectators. The essential problem is one of principles and criteria. Italy has made and will continue to make an active contribution to this question that is of fundamental importance to international peace and stability. It will continue to fight for a more democratic, efficient and geographically representative Security Council. No one should feel excluded. Every country, no matter how large or small, has a contribution to make, an experience to share. Given the current stalemate over increasing the number of permanent members, we wonder whether it would not make more sense to concentrate for the time being only on an increase in non-permanent seats. The solution of increasing the number of elective seats for every regional group would make it easier for all Member States to have access to the Security Council. After all, this is the same solution that was adopted in 1963, when the only previous enlargement of the Council took place. As to the method we should follow to get there, we believe that on a matter of such crucial importance it is essential that any decision with Charter amendment implications should be adopted by a majority of two thirds of all Member States, as prescribed by Article 108 of the Charter. These are some of our suggestions for the “quiet revolution” of the United Nations, to which Secretary- General Kofi Annan has dedicated such passion. We are grateful to him for his efforts. 21 The century that is about to end has taught that there are no definitive and total solutions. Although the institutions are imperfect, they are flexible instruments. It is our high duty to improve them so that they can become the visible hand of stability, together with the invisible hand of the market. Institutions are the only truly indispensable power. It gives me great pleasure to extend to Mr. Didier Opertti warmest congratulations on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago on his election as President of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. Trinidad and Tobago is indeed heartened to see one of its regional neighbours in this post, more so given the close ties of friendship which exist between Trinidad and Tobago and Uruguay. I am convinced that under his astute guidance the deliberations of the Assembly will be managed with the same skill and diplomacy with which he is known to discharge his duties of office. I also take this opportunity to express deep appreciation for the manner in which his predecessor, Mr. Udovenko, undertook the tasks of office during his tenure as President of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly. The impact of his leadership and the achievements of the Assembly during the last session of the General Assembly can only redound to the benefit of this body. The United Nations has grappled, over the past 53 years of its existence, with myriad issues confronting the international community — old issues and new issues, especially those which have taken on a new dynamic in the international relations of our Member States. Having successfully manoeuvred through the high seas of the cold war, the United Nations continues to confront issues of direct concern to all its Member States. In striving to attain its goals of international peace and security and justice for all, which are the raison d’être of the United Nations, this most valuable Organization to all of the world’s peoples is now drawn to focus on development as a necessary precondition to the achievement of international peace and security. We are now called upon to focus attention on the deep-seated problems of the global community. These include the alleviation of poverty; drug abuse and illicit 9 drug-trafficking; environmental degradation; economic growth and social development of developing countries; and; more recently, the effects of the international financial crisis. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is of the view that these challenges can be successfully addressed only through international cooperation. No individual state or region can in isolation rid itself of these problems. One of the principal tenets of international peace and security is the rule of international law. For too long, blatant disregard for international law has led to heinous crimes which have shocked the conscience of mankind, many of which have remained unpunished. Perpetrators of genocide, of crimes against humanity and of war crimes have acted with impunity, causing untold human suffering and loss of life on a massive scale. Each life lost, each soul affected, each family, society or country touched by tragedy is one too many. The international community has not, until now, established a permanent mechanism to punish the perpetrators of these unspeakable crimes. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is proud of the role played by Mr. Arthur Robinson, President of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, in refocusing the attention of the international community in 1989 on the need for the establishment of a permanent International Criminal Court. We congratulate the ever increasing number of States which have worked assiduously since then to ensure the establishment of a permanent, independent and effective International Criminal Court. At the same time, we urge all States to continue, in the spirit of cooperation and compromise which ensured the success of the Rome Conference in July 1998, to complete the work that still remains to be done. In this quest, we all must be ever mindful of the continued threats to international peace and security as well as breaches of international justice, which are occurring even as we meet today. When the President of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago urged the international community to create a permanent International Criminal Court, it was in part a recognition of the gravity of the scourge of drug trafficking and its attendant ills, and of the pressing need for the Court to address the question of the punishment of individuals responsible for these crimes at an international level. At the Diplomatic Conference held in Rome, Trinidad and Tobago, with the support of Caribbean Community (CARICOM) member States and some other States, was successful in ensuring that the international community did not lose sight of the importance of the inclusion of the crimes of the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs within the jurisdiction of the Court. As a result, the Diplomatic Conference recommended that an acceptable definition and the inclusion of drug crimes be considered by a review conference to be convened after the entry into force of the Statute. Drug trafficking and the associated crimes of money- laundering and trafficking in arms continue to pose serious threats to the social, economic and political foundations of countries of the Caribbean, and to erode the moral fabric of our societies. We welcome the conclusions and recommendations of the twentieth special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem, held in June 1998, and we pledge our commitment to cooperate at the international, regional and national levels in the achievement of the goals and ideals which we adopted at that session. Trinidad and Tobago will persist in its efforts on a regional basis to foster the type of cooperation that would combat the scourge of drug trafficking. Such action includes the implementation of the 1994 Barbados Programme of Action, which facilitates effective drug control cooperation in the region. Also, CARICOM countries, with the assistance of the Governments of Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, have created a witness protection programme. In addition, Port of Spain is the headquarters of the secretariat of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force on money- laundering. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is cooperating at the bilateral level with the three countries just mentioned in areas such as extradition and maritime counter-drug operations. We are also the beneficiary of technical assistance in the strengthening of our Counter Drug Crime Task Force to facilitate our efforts in addressing this menace to society. Action at the national level includes the establishment of an agency to coordinate the overall efforts against drug-trafficking and the preparation of a master plan to deal with the problem. A strong legal framework has been put in place to enable prosecutions and investigations. Appropriate legislation to facilitate judicial cooperation with other countries and participation in regional and multilateral institutions has also been enacted. Legislation currently before Parliament will 10 significantly improve the provisions against money- laundering. The eradication of drug-trafficking, money-laundering, and the traffic in arms and their associated evils must be a task for all Member States. The deleterious effects on our small societies threaten future generations of our peoples and have significant negative repercussions on our vulnerable economies. The eradication of this affliction of our societies is a sine qua non for development and for the achievement of international peace, security and justice. Trinidad and Tobago shares the sadness, shock and outrage of the international community at the recent terrorist attacks on United States embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, as well as at the bombings in South Africa and in Ireland. This spectre of terrorism continues to rear its ugly head in our world, in spite of the numerous efforts that have been undertaken on a multilateral level to eradicate this evil. At the second informal consultations of the Council for Foreign and Community Relations, held in New York on 24 September 1998, Caribbean Community Foreign Ministers condemned the recent terrorist attacks in several parts of the world and reiterated their strongest commitment to the fight against international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. They also pledged that their respective Governments would consider acceding to relevant international conventions and protocols on international terrorism. The Ministers reaffirmed that the most effective way to confront international terrorism is through an enhanced multilateral approach and multilateral actions, and with appropriate oversight and accountability measures. International conferences have also attempted to draw up a blueprint for addressing the environmental problems that plague the nations of the world. In 1992, at the Earth Summit in Rio, the international community for the first time linked environmental and economic issues. The Barbados Programme of Action adopted two years later, which addressed the specific problems of small island developing States, complements Agenda 21, the blueprint for sustainable development adopted at Rio. The small island developing States (SIDS) Programme of Action, which is to be reviewed at a special session of the General Assembly next year, is therefore of critical importance to small island States. We anticipate that the results of the review will be more promising than those of Agenda 21. The pace of globalization and economic liberalization has heightened the economic problems that developing countries face. This is evidenced in, among other things, the collapse of the financial markets, the unfair terms of trade and the developing countries’ increasing difficulty in accessing the markets of the developed countries. The crisis presently facing many States and the gathering gloom over the world economy pose very real dangers for developing countries and therefore call for properly devised strategies and the establishment of new mechanisms to ensure our survival. Recent developments within the international economic and financial arena are clear indications that the world economic system is crying out for urgent change. The imperfections, which are becoming increasingly glaring, can no longer be ignored. We cannot simply bear witness to the events. We must act now or lose a golden opportunity to influence the changes which are in the best interest of all humanity. We must have healthy, constructive dialogue at all levels and develop the political will and direction to find relevant solutions. To this end, I wish to reiterate the call made by the honourable Minister for Foreign Affairs of Trinidad and Tobago, Mr. Ralph Maraj, at the Twelfth Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries, held last month in Durban, South Africa, for the convening of a United Nations conference on the world economy. It is evident from the views expressed from this podium during the last two weeks that Member States recognize the need for urgent action at the international level to address this issue. In this volatile economic environment, small island developing States are rendered even more vulnerable by their inherent features of size, remoteness, insularity and susceptibility to natural disasters. Indeed, in one fell swoop any small advances in economic development can be brought to nought by natural disasters. The devastation wreaked by the recent Hurricane Georges on small States of the Caribbean bears sad testimony to this reality. Trinidad and Tobago shares the grief of its Caribbean neighbours at the loss of life and the damage to property suffered in this hurricane. As is the case with other developing countries, the needs of small island developing States cannot be addressed without the full support and cooperation of the international community. Trinidad and Tobago continues to make every effort to provide assistance to the islands affected by this disaster, in cooperation with the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency, a regional agency established to deal with all types of disasters. 11 Trinidad and Tobago has succeeded to some extent in achieving integration into the world economy as it undertakes the transition from an oil-dependent, public- sector dominated economy to a more diversified market- oriented private-sector led one. There is still a pressing need, however, for employment-generating growth from non-traditional labour-intensive sectors which will have more pointed impact on the reduction in poverty and unemployment levels in our country. Our people are hurting. It is imperative therefore that the United Nations programmes for development be directed more specifically towards employment creation opportunities for our peoples. Trade policy is an important area of concentration of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Developing countries, including small island States, are being asked to compete with developed countries while unequal levels of economic development persist — and to do so in a very difficult economic environment and within unrealistic time- frames. Small States must adopt a series of policy changes to reorient their economies and diversify their production bases. While implementing these measures, they must also develop their internal capacities to deal simultaneously with such policy changes. This cannot be achieved in the short term without a high degree of support from the regional and international organizations and the international community as a whole. It is imperative that we find innovative ways to bridge the gap between the United Nations and private citizens. It is in this context that we welcome the establishment of the United Nations Fund for International Partnerships, which will strengthen partnerships to support the United Nations and its projects and deliver resources to programmes and peoples served by United Nations agencies. The approval of grants for projects in the broad categories of children’s health, environment and climate change, women and population, food security, drug control, poverty alleviation and landmines will contribute significantly to the pursuit of the goals of the United Nations. The establishment of this Fund is testimony to what can be achieved by a shared vision and commitment to the principles and ideals of the Organization. We urge optimum use of the benefits to be derived from the Fund. As we observe the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights this year, Trinidad and Tobago would like to restate its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights and the fundamental freedoms of its citizens. The Constitution of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago guarantees human rights and freedom to all its citizens, without discrimination based on race, origin, colour, religion or sex. The right to life, liberty, security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof, except by due process of law, are guaranteed by the Constitution. Also guaranteed are the right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, the right to a fair trial, freedom of expression and freedom of the press. An independent judiciary is ever vigilant to ensure that these rights are not abrogated or infringed. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is fully cognizant of its duty to protect the security and well- being of its citizens, including the innocent, the victims of violence and the vulnerable. Their rights have also been guaranteed by the Constitution. We do not subscribe to the current trend that subordinates the rights of these citizens to those of the perpetrators of violent crimes against them. We are of the view that our innocent citizens also deserve the Government’s protection of their basic rights to life and security of the person. We cannot speak of development without focusing specific attention on the problems of social development, poverty eradication and sustainable economic development. The international community must, now more than ever, jointly seek to ensure both the economic well-being and the social development of all its peoples. In this regard, the United Nations has made tremendous strides in its efforts to confront the problems of development and to improve the quality of life of humankind. We are aware that, to this end, a number of tools have been devised to enable the international community to build a consensus in the social and economic fields. It is of special significance to Trinidad and Tobago that, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 50/161 of 22 December 1995, a special session of the General Assembly will be convened in the year 2000 for an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of the outcome of the 1995 World Summit for Social Development and to consider further actions and initiatives. The 10 commitments undertaken at the World Summit in Copenhagen constitute strong imperatives by Member States and the international community to achieve social development with the well-being of individuals in the society at the core. One of the commitments given priority attention at the Copenhagen 12 Summit was the eradication of poverty. However, poverty levels remain alarmingly high, and more practical initiatives towards eradicating poverty are essential. We are pleased that the General Assembly has identified this as a priority issue and has dedicated the period 1997-2006 as the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty in order to achieve the goal of eradicating absolute poverty and reducing overall poverty substantially in the world. The effect of globalization and its impact on social development must be carefully studied. The United Nations and its relevant bodies will be a useful forum for this discourse. Trinidad and Tobago sees these as some of the issues which the Preparatory Committee for the special session should consider when it convenes its substantive sessions in May 1999 and April 2000 to ensure that the special session will be meaningful. In September 1995, at the Fourth World Conference on Women, firm commitments were undertaken to improve the status of women by adopting the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. Follow-up activities are under way and should continue apace vigorously to ensure that the mandates of the Beijing Conference are fully implemented. An area which requires special focus is the enhancement of women’s involvement in the development process. We welcome the decision taken by the General Assembly in December 1997 to convene in the year 2000 a high-level plenary review to appraise and assess the progress achieved in the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action and to consider further action and initiatives. Trinidad and Tobago attaches great significance to the rights of children. We are committed to ensuring that they are neither disadvantaged nor deprived in any fashion of the means necessary for their wholesome development and their full integration into society. Since the entry into force of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Trinidad and Tobago has taken a number of measures to promote and pursue the mandates of the Convention. Steps have also been taken to achieve national awareness in this area, including the elaboration of a national Plan of Action for the Survival, Protection and Development of Children, the promotion of the rights of children through school and community outreach programmes and the establishment of a Child Registry for monitoring children in need of special protection. Measures are also being undertaken with respect to the harmonization and codification of all laws relating to children, as well as the establishment of a Family Court. We are on a swift march towards the new millennium. Let us, as a community of nations, renew our resolve to work towards the achievement of the goals we have set for ourselves: goals of peace, security, justice and development for all. Political will and commitment are necessary for this process, as is a genuine appreciation of the realities faced by each individual member of the international community in the pursuit of these goals. We, the Member States of the United Nations, must not lose sight of the interdependence of development and the attainment of these ideals. As we formulate new policies in our strategy for the improvement of all aspects of the lives of humankind, and as we invent new modalities for their implementation, we are encouraged by the many successes we have had, especially in recent years. Trinidad and Tobago pledges to continue to work assiduously in its efforts to establish the foundations for a peaceful, secure and just world. This is the only legacy we must leave to future generations. I would like, before beginning my statement, to express my solidarity with the peoples of the Caribbean nations who during the past few days have been victims of hurricane Georges. As well as warmly greeting all representatives, I would like to express my very cordial congratulations to Mr. Opertti on his election as President of the General Assembly for its fifty-third session. This eminent position not only represents well-deserved recognition of his capability and experience, but is also a significant distinction for Latin America. Allow me also to express my appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his vision and efforts to promote deep reforms of the United Nations system. Nicaragua gives its total support to these important initiatives, which are aimed at strengthening and promoting the Organization?s role in international cooperation for sustainable development. With regard to the Security Council, there are grounds for concern over the postponements and absence of concrete proposals from the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters Related to the Security Council. My country shares the opinion that resolutions involving amendments to the Charter must be approved by two thirds of the members of the General Assembly. The globalization of all spheres of life and liberalization of the economy constitute a new challenge. In this connection, we share the view of the Secretary- General, expressed in his annual report, about the need to reorient actions and efforts with a new vision that will help countries carry out a satisfactory transition to the globalized economy, which involves complex and sensitive processes. At the end of the twentieth century, the world is facing profound changes that require innovative solutions in order for humanity to move in such a direction that science and technology can have a positive effect on the development of countries. The historic transformation we are living through has frequently increased the inequalities between countries; we must therefore plan how to reduce these negative effects. In commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we reaffirm our 9 commitment to continue to work with all the means at our disposal to promote and protect human rights. In Nicaragua we are moving ahead with the consolidation of peace and democracy based on full respect for human rights, establishment of the rule of law, respect for the separation of powers and the guarantee of individual liberties. At the same time, we have taken important steps in order to reach higher levels of economic development with social equity. My Government is convinced that in order to reap fruits we must plant seeds, human capital being one of the best investments for integrated and sustainable development. We have therefore made it a priority to raise levels of education and extend its reach to all sectors. Likewise, we are redirecting our efforts and resources to maintain and improve social programmes for the protection of individuals and families in great poverty. This, together with dealing with unemployment, is our priority. The Government?s social policies require healthy and effective economic policies that ensure continuity along with the necessary impetus for development. In this connection, the Government?s general objective is to make it possible for the private sector to create products and jobs within a climate of stability, promoted by establishing clear, reliable and transparent rules that apply equally to everyone, as well as through dialogue and agreement, which are the cornerstones of governability and harmony. In this context, strengthening the integrated system for procuring and administering justice is essential. This includes the sensitive area of security for individuals and their property. The macroeconomic transformations that we have undertaken include significant reforms in the taxation and financial system, as well as important measures to protect the environment, creating an awareness of the need to utilize rationally our natural wealth. These initiatives have been supported by the international community, and in this connection it is appropriate to recognize the assistance received from the United Nations Development Programme for many endeavours — especially its support, in coordination with civil society and non-governmental organizations, for the National Commission for Sustainable Development. Nicaragua hopes that at the next Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Buenos Aires in November this year, there will be recognition of the environmental protection work done by the developing countries in designating important expanses of their territories as protected areas. Likewise, we hope that mechanisms for clean development to facilitate the reduction of greenhouse gases will be adopted. At the end of this millennium the battle against the production, trafficking in and use of drugs continues to be one of the greatest challenges to humanity. My country expresses its satisfaction at the results achieved during the special session of the General Assembly devoted to this important subject. Similarly, we are participating actively in the negotiation and signing of the Inter-American Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives, and Other Related Materials, approved on 13 November 1997 by the Organization of American States. We consider international terrorism and other forms of organized crime to be terrible scourges of our societies. We condemn all terrorist acts and reassert our conviction that they require firm and severe responses. We are in solidarity with the victims of these actions and support every initiative to increase international cooperation in confronting these inhuman, cruel and unlawful activities that affect the security of our States. We repeat that the role of my Government is that of facilitator and promoter. We are firm believers in the free market economy, with a humanistic sensibility and social justice. We believe with the same pragmatic conviction in globalization and in the broadest and most active international relations, without exception. Globalization is not a panacea per se, although it is an exceptional opportunity if prudent and realistic measures are envisaged and taken. These must also be imaginative and audacious, without neglecting the palliatives that mitigate and cushion the rigours of the first phases of adjustment and opening up. There is no doubt that globalization will promote unity at the international level. Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the whirlwind forces that could cause irreparable internal ruptures should the less-favoured majority sectors — which are precisely those that demand our priority attention to their urgent vital needs — be sacrificed to gain time and avoid difficulties. Moreover, the vulnerability to which smaller economies are exposed in the face of crisis — such as that of the financial markets currently casting a shadow over the world economy — cannot be avoided. In the first 18 months of my Administration, we have had the highest rate of economic growth in Central America: 5 per cent in 1997 and an estimated rate of slightly over 6 per cent for the current year. Within these indicators, the increase in the agricultural sector is 60 per cent. At the same time, we have created 170,000 new productive jobs, with a goal of 500,000 contemplated for the five-year term of 1997-2001 for which I was elected President. In 1997, we brought inflation down to an annual level of 7 per cent. Our economic policy has received the backing of the international community, represented by over 40 countries and multilateral organizations. After Nicaragua reached an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, in Geneva, Switzerland, in April of this year, on a new programme for an enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF), these supporters won us $1.8 billion over the next three years. Furthermore, upon the completion of the ESAF programme, we would be forgiven up to 80 per cent of the large external debt inherited from the past, within the concessionary programme of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. These signs appear to indicate that, given the steps we are taking and the enormous sacrifices we are making, the time-frame for our becoming creditors to these facilities could be shortened. We have turned to the international community, calling on it from its highest forum to continue to support us in our daily and difficult battle to get ahead, leaving behind a dark past of destruction and violence which we have been slowly overcoming with the combined efforts of all, guided by a sincere spirit of reconciliation based on forgiveness and forgetting. The exhausting legacy of that past is the burden of a gigantic foreign debt of approximately $12.5 billion and a devastated economy, which, within the space of a few years, was set back dramatically by more than 50 years. We seek understanding and help to achieve forgiveness of our stifling external debt as soon as possible. We must bear in mind that the United Nations, as a supranational body that coordinates and harmonizes the world?s efforts in many areas, is the most important and pluralistic forum in which the opinions of all States are freely expressed and the most important decisions taken within the framework of world politics. Nevertheless, we note once again, with great sadness, the absence of the sister Republic of China, which, as we all know, was a founding Member of the United Nations in 1945. The international community is aware that the Republic of China respects the principles that govern the United Nations Charter, particularly its mission of peace and broad and generous international cooperation. The denial of the right of a people to be recognized and accorded full and effective participation misrepresents and contradicts the noble spirit of the universal mission of this Organization and constitutes a painful collective violation of the human rights of more than 21 million people. We therefore call once again on the nations of the world to reconsider resolution 2758 (XXVI), which so unjustly excludes the Republic of China, with a view to restoring its right to participate in all the activities of the United Nations. We are certain, Sir, that under your enlightened guidance, we will achieve concrete results on the delicate points on our agenda that will undoubtedly help our peoples and Governments in a very positive and tangible way to achieve the widest and most satisfactory shared benefits.   Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty- third session. I am convinced that under your guidance this session will be crowned with success. I should also like to express my sincere gratitude to your predecessor, the representative of Ukraine, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for the skill with which he led this body during his term of office. I should like to take this opportunity to express our deepest appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his efforts to promote the reform of the Organization for the benefit of the entire international community. I have the honour and the privilege of addressing the General Assembly for the first time. From this lofty rostrum I should like to underline the importance the Republic of Moldova attaches to the role of the United Nations in the world. In the new world structure, the United Nations is, for the Republic of Moldova, as it is for other States, the body that allows them to express their national identity and their own points of view in a framework with the largest possible audience and resonance. This is why my country takes an active part in debates on issues of importance to the international community, pertaining to the maintenance of peace and international security, to social and economic development, to the expansion of international and regional cooperation, to fighting terrorism and to increasing the role and effectiveness of the United Nations. The far-reaching changes in international life at the end of this century have left their imprint on the activities of the United Nations. That is why we must strengthen and further improve the United Nations system so as to renew and adapt the Organization to the increased demands of international cooperation. Today, more than a year after the new initiatives were launched by the Secretary-General, we observe that his proposals, recommendations and specific measures for reforming the United Nations correspond to a large extent to these demands. My delegation welcomes the progress achieved in the reform process of the United Nations, particularly in the economic and social spheres, and supports the measures to streamline and make more efficient the activities of the Organization. We believe that the merging of some structures, as well as decentralization and the transfer of authority to field offices will make an essential contribution to adapting the United Nations to new requirements. We believe that the debates during this session on proposals and measures for the restructuring of the entire United Nations system will have an impact on other areas of the Organization?s activities. The increase in the number of Security Council members is the crux of the overall reform of the United Nations. Since, thus far, we have not found generally acceptable solutions pertaining to the various aspects of the issue of reforming the Security Council, we believe that during this session Member States should show the same spirit of compromise as that shown by the Working Group on the Security Council question. While taking into account the need to ensure better representation of Member States in the Security Council, the Republic of Moldova, as at previous sessions, continues to be in favour of a moderate expansion in the number of Council members. New permanent seats should be granted to developed countries such as Germany and Japan, as the Republic of Moldova has advocated at several previous sessions of the General Assembly, and possibly to developing countries as well. Regarding the number of non-permanent seats, the Republic of Moldova is in favour of a reasonable increase in accordance with the principle of equitable geographical representation so as to reflect the interests of all regional groups. To our mind, an increase in the number of the 4 members of the Security Council in that category should take into account the legitimate interest of States of Central and Eastern Europe in having an additional, non-permanent seat since in recent years the number of States in that region has doubled. Changes that have taken place in recent years in States with transitional economies, including the Republic of Moldova, have shown that political and economic changes involve risks and difficulties that affect several areas of society. Major problems, such as a decline in production, are too complex to be solved only with one?s own resources. In such circumstances, the role of the United Nations system in the economic and social spheres takes on a new dimension. The United Nations must remain the framework for international cooperation for all nations. This, in fact, is an absolute necessity in the current situation, in which financial crises have affected the economies of several countries, thereby jeopardizing their political and economic reforms. Committed to the path of democracy, the Republic of Moldova is steadily striving to create basic institutions for the rule of law and the legislative framework necessary for transition to a market economy. As a result, we have been able to stabilize the macroeconomic situation and have reduced the annual inflation rate to 12 per cent. My country takes an active part in international cooperation within the framework of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation, the South-East European Cooperative Initiative, the Central European Initiative and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. Similarly, the signing of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with the European Union has considerably diversified economic relations for the Republic of Moldova. My country also attaches crucial importance to its forthcoming adherence to the World Trade Organization. Like other Member States, including those with economies in transition, the Republic of Moldova has taken part in United Nations projects in the economic and social sphere and is benefiting from the assistance and support of the United Nations to promote economic reform. This is why we greatly appreciate the activities of the United Nations Development Programme. The economic decline in Asia has engendered a world economic crisis with devastating consequences. As the Secretary-General has said, the world economic crisis has been felt in Russia, in North America and in Europe. Today, major economies are increasingly feeling the impact of events taking place in less developed areas of the world. In the process of the globalization of the world economy, the United Nations could serve as a coordinating centre for creating an international financial structure. Managing the crisis and the effects of globalization also has particular importance for countries with economies in transition. Those States find themselves at the stage of moving towards a market economy, which requires the achievement of a whole set of objectives, such as macroeconomic stabilization, reform of price- setting mechanisms, restructuring of the major sectors of the economy, reduction of inflation, creation of new jobs and, last but not least, integration into the world economy. Finally, it is important in our view that, in seeking solutions to the problems facing States with economies in transition, we should take into account first and foremost the specific characteristics of each country. We must take into consideration the fact that economic recovery in this category of countries is a complex problem because of the particularities of each State. We hope that the United Nations will enhance its presence in States with economies in transition through regional economic commissions, as well as through funds and specialized agencies. We also deem it useful in this regard to consider the question of the integration of the economies of countries in transition into the world economy. In the context of the debate on reform in the economic sphere, I wish to note that my country supports decisions adopted by the General Assembly and by the Economic and Social Council regarding an increase in development assistance and effective coordination of activities of the regional commissions with other bodies of the United Nations system. The commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is yet another reason to intensify efforts to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world. The Republic of Moldova greatly appreciates United Nations human rights activities and supports the reform measures that have been adopted, in particular those 5 pertaining to strengthening the role of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. My country attaches special importance to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Republic of Moldova has acceded to the major international legal instruments on human rights adopted within the framework of the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Our Parliament has ratified a series of international conventions such as the International Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and on Civil and Political Rights. The Parliament of the Republic of Moldova has adopted more than 20 laws dealing expressly with human rights. Respect for and protection of human rights in my country are also safeguarded by the Constitutional Court, which has the final say on the Constitution, by the principle of the separation of powers, and by the responsibility of the State towards its citizens. The major events of the past decade have had a considerable impact on the situation in various parts of the world. Sometimes these events have been complicated by social tension and by serious violations of human rights, and have even given rise to armed conflicts. It is known that the conflict in the eastern part of the Republic of Moldova in the summer of 1992 was caused by the dismantling of the USSR and that it was supported by forces wishing to preserve the old political system. Unfortunately, we were unable to avoid that tragic situation. Even though the conflict has ceased, its consequences remain. There has been no final settlement of the conflict, and to some extent this is an obstacle to the process of the democratization of society and to the promotion of democratic reforms. Serious human rights violations continue in the eastern part of the Republic of Moldova. Members of the Ilascu group have not yet been released; in the meantime, Prisoner Ilascu has actually been elected as a Deputy in the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova. The efforts of the Republic of Moldova to settle this conflict peacefully, and my country?s readiness to grant that region special status with broad authority, on the condition that it respects the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Moldova, are well known. But I have to recall that we are still facing difficulties in the negotiating process that took place with the cooperation of the OSCE and representatives of the Russian Federation and of Ukraine as mediators. The irreconcilable position of the separatist leaders has blocked the full implementation of agreements signed with the help of the mediators, which were intended to be interim documents that could help renew negotiations and increase trust among the parties. The situation is further aggravated by the presence in the region of vast quantities of weapons and ammunition and vast numbers of foreign troops. However, on 21 October 1994 the Republic of Moldova and the Russian Federation signed an agreement on the withdrawal of armaments and military personnel. Unfortunately the Russians have yet to ratify that agreement. Implementation of the agreement would be in line with the letter and the spirit of the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova, which stipulates the neutrality of our State and bans the deployment of foreign troops on our territory. We believe that the immediate withdrawal of these vast quantities of weapons and ammunition would considerably strengthen stability in the region while facilitating the process of settling the crisis. In that context, we hope that the OSCE mission in the Republic of Moldova and the mediator States, the Russian Federation and Ukraine, will intensify their efforts to bring about the resumption of negotiations in conformity with the principle of respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova, and that they will contribute to the withdrawal of the weapons, ammunition and troops. This would defuse the conflict and would create conditions propitious for its final settlement. Finally, I state solemnly that the Republic of Moldova remains open to dialogue and will continue to try to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. We hope that common sense will prevail. The problems facing humankind as we come to the end of this century are many and complex. Although the threat of another world war has been diminished, humanity must face a multitude of conflicts and tensions that jeopardize peace and stability in many parts of the world. I believe that we must make use of all our experience, and focus all our efforts to resolve current crises and to prevent conflicts. In my view, we can face today?s challenges and ensure world peace and security only through joint action by the international community. At this stage of ongoing globalization, the United Nations, with its universal mission, remains the principal forum in which to find solutions to crucial issues. My country is ready to cooperate with all other Member States to 6 strengthen the Organization?s capacity better to meet the challenges of the coming millennium.  The election of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session is a source of pride for Latin America and the Caribbean. I am personally familiar with the talent, experience and diplomatic skill of Minister Opertti and I am convinced that these qualities will help to guide, motivate and strengthen our work. My delegation would also like to express its appreciation to Hennadiy Udovenko for the outstanding work that he accomplished as President at the session that just closed. Last July, we had the honour of welcoming our Secretary-General to Mexico. On that occasion we observed anew his firm and resolute commitment to strengthen the United Nations, adapting it to confront the challenges of the end of the century. We recognize in Kofi Annan a man with a clear vision of the future of the Organization, and we are confident that he will know how to guide it in this transition stage towards a new millennium. Mexico is a country with a profound multilateral calling. Our desire to seek international agreement finds fertile ground for development in this forum. It is for this reason that we are convinced of the urgent need to strengthen it and to seek within it shared answers to the challenges that the new global agenda presents. Mexicoâs commitment to the United Nations does not consist of words alone. A week ago, the Government of President Ernesto Zedillo reconfirmed this by sending the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families to the Mexican Senate for approval. From the very beginning of negotiations on that Convention, over which Mexico had the honour of presiding, we insisted on the importance of having legal instruments to ensure respect for and protection of the rights of migrant workers. By taking that step, Mexico is showing its unswerving commitment to the norms of international law and is making progress in consolidating itself as a State of law. Convinced of the need to strengthen the international system that makes it possible for us to have the will and the necessary instruments to confront together the challenges of the end of the century, President Zedillo promoted the convening of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the problem of drugs. As of that meeting, principles of responsibility shared among States and of strict respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of States replaced the scenario of mutual recrimination and unilateral evaluations. We now have the bases for a global consensus regarding the policies that must be adopted by 8 States in order to consolidate an unprecedented effort at cooperation based on this new global, integral and balanced strategy. Mexico will not regress in its efforts to implement the commitments that we adopted last June. The international agenda today, as reflected in the agenda of the General Assembly, is very broad and complex. I would like to refer on this occasion to only three questions which I consider to be of particular relevance: disarmament, which has been a constant issue in Mexicoâs foreign policy; the reform of our Organization, which will help to shape the community of nations in the next century; and the international financial crisis, which greatly jeopardizes the efforts of our countries to attain full development, as well as our ability to advance towards the future. As far as the subject of disarmament is concerned, there is no doubt that the existence of nuclear arsenals remains one of the central problems in international relations. The threat of an atomic conflagration cannot be disregarded, and we must reiterate our commitment to fashioning a world which is free of nuclear weapons. For Mexico, the objective of eliminating these instruments of mass destruction is realistic and viable. It is time to set aside arguments that, for strategic reasons, have served to conceal the efforts of those who either do not want to give up their present nuclear capacity or else want to join the group of countries that possess this destructive ability. One can contribute to nuclear disarmament only by eliminating nuclear weapons. This is why we seek to broaden and strengthen international commitments in this respect. Our political conviction is that we must achieve new agreements that remove this scourge from humankind. Mexico condemns all nuclear testing from principle and out of conviction. We affirmed this recently in the light of the tests conducted by India and Pakistan. Far from contributing to stability and regional balance, such actions promote the proliferation of uncertainty and fear. They also contribute to a climate conducive to the nuclear arms race. I would like on this occasion to reiterate Mexicoâs conviction that dialogue and negotiation are and will remain the irreplaceable means of resolving disputes. It was in that spirit that last 9 July we supported a ministerial statement that sought to define a new agenda for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. We co-sponsors of that declaration introduced a draft resolution that we hope will receive the resolute support of Member States so that we can in that way demonstrate the resolve of the community of nations to move towards a world free of nuclear weapons. We are also committed to a new, integral approach to the subject of disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction or weapons with excessively cruel and inhuman effects. There has been progress recently in the Conference on Disarmament related to security guarantees and the prohibition on the production of fissionable materials destined to be used for such weapons. We are likewise pleased at the growing support being given to the treaties on anti-personnel landmines and on chemical and bacteriological weapons. In particular, we are gratified at the entry into force on 1 March 1999 of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti- personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. Once again we urge the countries that have not yet done so to ratify as soon as possible these conventions that seek to eliminate such weapons from the face of the Earth. The proliferation of small arms and its link with criminal organizations and drug-trafficking constitute a significant challenge to the majority of nations. Combating this is a priority of the Government of Mexico. The Inter-American Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Materials, which was the result of a Mexican initiative, is of crucial importance and should therefore be taken into account in further negotiations on transnational crime. In the present situation, which demands that we clearly define the framework for international relations and adapt it in a timely way, the initiatives for reforming our Organization presented by the Secretary-General acquire special significance. The United Nations must reform itself if it is to remain a central force in our collective lives. We must recognize that traditional mechanisms for harmonization and negotiation are showing clear signs of exhaustion. We must rethink these strategies in order to deal with old and new problems. The consolidation of a structure which is truly democratic, transparent and well balanced, and which is consistent with the purpose and principles of the San Francisco Charter must be our common goal. 9 In this context, I wish to stress the importance of achieving a better balance between the principal organs of the United Nations. The Security Council needs to be reformed in order to strengthen its legitimacy, representativeness, effectiveness, democracy and transparency. In considering its structure, we must correct the deficiencies in its present composition. It is not a matter of size; rather, the problem is the lack of balance in its representativeness. The Security Council must reflect the plurality and diversity of the membership of the United Nations, taking into account the profound changes in political geography experienced in the last decade. Likewise, we must avoid repeating or even broadening existing inequalities. For this reason, Mexico is against increasing the number of permanent members. Let us not fall into the fallacy of believing that the Councilâs effectiveness resides in the right of veto. All rights bear responsibilities and these must not be abused. Otherwise, the necessary legitimacy which makes the Security Council efficient and effective is eroded. This is why I wish to reiterate our appeal to the permanent members to join in an open-minded way in designing a system to regulate the sphere of application of that privilege. Nonetheless, we recognize that structural reform of the Security Council will not in itself guarantee its effectiveness. Hence, we insist on the need to progress towards a thorough revision of its working methods and of the decision-making process. The community of nations has given that organ the high responsibility of ensuring international peace and security. Under paragraph 1 of Article 24 of the Charter, the members of the Organization recognize that the Council acts in our name in carrying out these functions. It is therefore clear that the Security Councilâs attitude must be profoundly democratic and one of respect towards the General Assembly, in accordance with paragraph 3 of the same Article. Anything else would be a violation of the letter and spirit of the Charter, and would mean an erosion of the Councilâs legitimacy and its capacity to fulfil the responsibilities that we have entrusted to it. We must break this vicious circle and make serious progress in the design and implementation of the needed reforms. My country will continue to participate actively in the Working Group charged with reform of the Security Council. We hope to be able to submit to the Assembly recommendations that can receive widespread support, genuinely reflecting the collective aspirations of all the members of the United Nations. Our concerns about international security and the capacity of our multilateral forums to respond effectively to new challenges are compounded today by the uncertainty caused by the international financial crisis. It is obvious that the Bretton Woods system has shown its inability to respond adequately to the challenges of the current international financial crisis. We are undoubtedly faced with a situation of high risk which threatens to erode the important development attainments of our emerging economies. Given the vicissitudes of the international financial situation, we, the countries of Latin America, have endeavoured to maintain our economic strength through profound and sometimes difficult processes of structural reform. We reaffirm our commitment to continue to manage in a responsible way the economic policy mechanisms that ensure our stability and growth. It is clear that this is not enough and that concerted action is needed on the part of all countries and international financial organs. Heads of State and Government of the Rio Group meeting in Panama on 4-5 September urged the countries in which the financial crisis originated to adopt the measures needed to correct their imbalances. They made an appeal to the countries of the Group of 7 to immediately take the necessary measures to restore stability to financial markets and to ensure the growth of the world economy. The Rio Group also appealed to international financial institutions to be involved more quickly and effectively in finding solutions to the international financial crisis. Overcoming the present situation must be our priority. We must be creative in order to find formulas that make it possible for us to avoid recurring financial crises and banish the spectre of global recession. Just as the community of nations has recognized the wisdom of preventive action to protect international peace and security, it is now necessary to take that same course in order to prevent cracks in the fabric of the world economy. We must consider ways of implementing an early warning system that will allow us to detect financial crises in time and thus avoid their harmful effects. In the recent past, there have been warning signs which in isolation were not identified as a prelude to more serious problems. We must collect such experiences, learn from them and prepare ourselves better for the future. 10 No country is free from responsibilities, just as no country is free of the effects of international financial imbalances. It is therefore up to us together and with a clear sense of direction to seek the proper mechanisms to respond early to signs that larger problems are imminent. In this universal forum, I reiterate our conviction that we must act resolutely in the short term. We need to define an agenda for international economic stability. We appeal to the Secretary-General so that, under his leadership and guidance, we can share experiences and proposals that will help us work toward global financial security. By attaining that goal of preventive diplomacy, we will be contributing to the development and well-being of millions of persons who are victims of the financial uncertainty that today afflicts all economies, particularly those of a relatively lower level of development, and endangers the stability of all nations. In the face of an uncertain political and economic panorama, the role of the United Nations takes on new relevance. Recent changes on the international scene yield unprecedented opportunities but at the same time present challenges for which there are no easy answers. We must act together in order to encourage the necessary consensus as that will allow us to take advantage of the benefits of globalization and confront its challenges. We must fortify our individual and collective capacity in order to take advantage of the positive trends towards peace, stability, development and respect for law. Likewise, we must strengthen our ability to banish confrontation, violence, terror and inequality. The United Nations is the necessary forum for facing international problems and finding solutions to them. As we reaffirm our commitment to the purposes of the San Francisco Charter, we shall continue to promote the participation of the United Nations in the definition of the parameters of international coexistence.   On behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Benin, allow me to express to Mr. Didier Opertti my warm congratulations upon his brilliant and unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. His human skills and vast experience in international affairs, as well as his dedication to the main causes of our Organization, augur well for the success of the important deliberations of this session. My delegation would like to assure him of its full cooperation. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, who so skilfully and devotedly presided over the last session of the General Assembly. Allow me to associate to this tribute Mr. Kofi Annan, our Secretary-General, whose dedication and great diplomatic skills have given greater nobility to our Organization and new reasons for hope to our world. I should like to welcome here the efforts of this great African for the international community. My country, the Republic of Benin, could be perceived as just a dot on the world map and perhaps just as a jot on the map of Africa. In fact, the Republic of Benin is not manufacturing any atomic bombs, nor has it any intention of building or possessing them. But it is without any hesitation that I am speaking before the representatives of the international community and all the major Powers gathered here to express the profound concerns we have over the state of the world today, and to voice our hopes. Benin may be only a small point on the world map, but it wants to be a point of convergence — not only in Africa, but also for the entire international community. We want to commit ourselves to building peace rather 17 than bombs, and to promote international cooperation — and to promote it first at home. The Government of Benin is committed to building peace by consistently cultivating tolerance and a spirit of sharing. There is no other explanation for the ever growing consolidation of democracy in Benin. Eschewing the words and customs of others, the people of Benin have boldly chosen a multi-party system after many years of curtailed political freedoms. In other words, they have chosen a politics of peace and tolerance. Today more than 100 political parties vie against each other, unite or clash, but they do so in peace and with respect for the Constitution and the law. My delegation believes that there is no more urgent task today than replacing the culture of violence and war which has marked humanity since the dawn of history and which has so overwhelmed and gravely afflicted Africa and other regions of the world. That culture must be replaced by the culture of peace. We believe that the foremost duty of our Organization continues to be the promotion of peace and all its values and the behaviour that underpins and strengthens it. We believe that the first of these values is the spirit of sharing. There can be no peace in the world if a small portion of humanity can surf the Internet and explore interstellar space while others flounder in quagmire, seeking a mere pittance or safe shelter in their flight from wars whose root cause is a desire to retain power — the power to control land, gold, oil, diamonds and other natural resources solely for the benefit of arms dealers. This apocalyptic picture is unfortunately typical of the sad situation in Africa. It is therefore important to unite all our efforts to halt all conflicts, not only in Africa, but also in Europe, the Balkans — indeed, wherever they arise. The spirit of tolerance and sharing has prompted my Government to develop the concept of a common social minimum. This means that all citizens of Benin, wherever they reside, must be able to feed, house, clothe, care for and educate themselves. It would be desirable for a common social minimum to be proclaimed as an essential objective on the global scale. I should like to pause here to commend the efforts and great sacrifices made by various Governments and international organizations — particularly the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), through its Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) and the United Nations itself — to restore peace to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Angola, Ethiopia, Eritrea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Whether in Africa or the Balkans, what lasting solution can possibly be imposed by force of arms today? Why do Mr. Savimbi and those who support him, either covertly or overtly, refuse to see that the time for peace has come for the martyred people of Angola? With respect to all those conflicts in Africa, the Republic of Benin welcomes the report (A/52/871) presented by the Secretary-General at the request of the Security Council on the causes of conflict in Africa. The Secretary-General?s appeal deserves to be heard and supported, not only by Africans but also by all those whose political, economic or financial decisions will influence the future of the continent. If the spirit of peace, sharing and tolerance prevailed in the Middle East, the long-delayed peace would undoubtedly be established there. We have learned in recent days of the efforts which have been resumed so many times by the United States of America to end the stagnation of the peace process, for which Mr. Netanyahu?s Government is principally responsible. Let us hope that peace will have a better chance this time. One of the main items on our agenda is the strengthening of the non-proliferation regime and the banning of nuclear tests. In this connection, the Republic of Benin welcomes the decision by India and Pakistan to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We have no particular lesson for those two great countries, which are our friends. But it is clear to us that the possession of atomic bombs cannot offer either of them a lasting victory; only a prosperous country and people can confer that. Humanity will continue to be under threat until the current stockpile of nuclear weapons is destroyed. The major nuclear Powers must today admit this self-evident truth. While nuclear weapons pose a permanent danger to us all, small arms in my country sow permanent insecurity and hamper our economic development efforts. Last May a group of heavily armed gangsters attacked a bank in broad daylight right in the middle of Cotonou, killing security guards and making off with tens of millions of francs. If small arms were not available, such incidents and armed conflicts would certainly be less 18 common, and outlaws would not be as terrifyingly effective as they are today in numerous countries where ill-equipped police and militias cannot resist them. The massacre must be stopped, first and foremost by dealing with those who are primarily responsible — the producers and exporters of small arms. That is why Benin supports the conclusions of the International Conference on the Proposed Moratorium for Small Arms Transfers in West Africa, which was held in Oslo, Norway, from 1 to 2 April 1998. It has been said that a hungry man is not a free man. I have spoken at length about arms, conflicts and wars because, basically, my delegation is hopeful that by banning the former we can more easily end or at least diminish the latter. On the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it is important to emphasize that the affirmation of human rights must go hand in hand with the eradication of poverty. We cannot speak seriously about human rights, liberty or democracy in a country where the people have neither bread nor schools. My country hopes that bold and vigorous measures will be taken, particularly by the richest countries, so that those whom globalization leaves inexorably by the wayside can be given a chance to enter the twenty-first century with a little more hope. The bold measures must relate in particular to the issues of debt and the allocation of additional resources for development. Like many other countries in Africa, Asia and America, the Republic of Benin has taken control of its destiny by carrying out reforms that have often proved very difficult. Even if our development partners are standing beside us, these reforms and efforts express first and foremost the desire of our States and our peoples to take charge and to emerge from underdevelopment and poverty. And we have begun to obtain results. In my country, for example, economic growth has now surpassed demographic growth. We must carry our burden even if we have to do so on our knees; we must not let it fall. I therefore call upon all those responsible for making economic decisions at the global level to support more vigorously the efforts of countries whose burden has brought them to their knees. In this context, I should like to reaffirm the importance that the Government of Benin attaches to the operational development activities of the United Nations system, which, we are pleased to say, are aimed at enabling the recipient countries to take control of their own development. We believe that the decline in contributions to core resources for funds and programmes such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Children?s Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is a dangerous handicap. The Government of Benin hopes that the donor countries will demonstrate greater solidarity by increasing the resources that they allocate to those institutions. Nevertheless, I should like to thank all of the funds, programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations whose technical and financial support in the past five years has been decisive in enabling us to pursue programmes aimed at constructing a State based on the rule of law and building a prosperous nation in which all the citizens of Benin can have a minimum of their common social requirements met. I should also like to welcome all the initiatives of the United Nations system, which have long been working for the development of Africa, as well as the actions of all our development partners, in particular Japan, which have ranked the development and economic recovery of the continent among their priorities. Although they may be positive and praiseworthy, initiatives to benefit Africa must henceforth meet the fundamental needs and priorities of the African countries. It is in this spirit that in several days? time Benin will be participating in the second Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD II). Our hope, which many others share, is that that Conference will go beyond the declaration that will no doubt be adopted and lead to a programme of concrete action aimed at finding solutions to the problems of the continent at the close of the twentieth century. At the beginning of my statement I referred to the spirit of tolerance and sharing. I believe that our Organization is the pre-eminent forum in which we can learn and refine this spirit. Despite all the criticism, the United Nations has, to date, proved irreplaceable. We must continue to try to refine it and to carry out reforms. In conclusion, therefore, I would like to reaffirm that the reform of the United Nations, which was begun under the bold initiative of Mr. Kofi Annan, deserves to be 19 supported and developed so as to guarantee the necessary conditions for the harmonious pursuit of the process of democratizing international relations at the dawn of the next millennium. If we want to begin the twenty-first century with self-confidence, and if we want the efforts and sacrifices that have been made thus far on the tortuous and rugged path to development not to have been in vain, we must do our utmost to focus greater attention on the principle of world partnership and the duty of solidarity, which is what the new international order necessarily implies. The twenty-first century may become one in which a blind global economy using the most sophisticated science and technology at the same time enslaves three quarters of humanity. This must not happen. Let us act now so that the next century can become the century of civilization par excellence, the century of sharing and of solidarity, the century of culture and the century of peace. The Republic of Benin is ready to play its part in this necessary struggle.  May I begin by congratulating the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. His election to this distinguished post is a testament to the international community’s appreciation of the effective contribution to international affairs made by his country, Uruguay, with which the Sultanate of Oman enjoys good relations of friendship and cooperation. We are confident that under his leadership and considerable diplomatic experience our deliberations here will be crowned with success. My delegation stands ready to cooperate with him fully in order to achieve all the aims envisaged by this session. May I also take this opportunity to express sincere thanks to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of friendly Ukraine for the exemplary and constructive manner with which he steered the work of the previous session. I would also like to confirm my country’s unwavering support for the sustained and dedicated work done by the Secretary- General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to enhance and reinvigorate the role of the United Nations and to restructure its principal bodies. 9 It has now been over half a century since the establishment of the United Nations, during which time it has handled a significant number of international issues. However, the United Nations often remains unable to resolve many regional crises which have erupted since the end of the cold war. In spite of the attention paid to these issues by the international community, the majority of those included in our agenda have remained without effective solutions. It is our view that this is due to the failure and lack of resolve on the part of Member States to utilize the mechanisms of the United Nations which were established on the basis of the Charter. If this is the case today, how will the future be, when we shall be expected to face more conflicts which may be different in nature and size as compared to old conflicts? We cannot address them in the conventional way. We shall have to examine their root causes and address their manifestations and give full support to the Organization in order to find the means to develop adequate bases for addressing them so as to protect the international community against their recurrence. The high-level working group of the General Assembly made progress in the area of restructuring and streamlining some of the main organs of the United Nations, in particular with regard to the question of reform and increase in the membership of the Security Council. The setback which the Open-ended Working Group on this question faced during the previous General Assembly session should not stand in the way of achieving further progress. We should not accept retreat from what has already been accomplished. We have to encourage the Working Group to redouble its efforts to complete the scope of the needed reforms of the United Nations in a manner that will meet the aspirations of the international community on the basis of comprehensiveness and equality among all States, which in turn will contribute balance and transparency to the methods of work of the Security Council. This will be a contribution to the decision-making process and to the clarity of vision with regard to the emerging developments in our contemporary world in which justice, security and peace should prevail. In this way, all Member States, large and small, would be enabled to participate in the resolution of international problems, especially those which have a direct impact on their own interests, in an appropriate and just manner. The greatest danger facing the Members of the United Nations in the post-cold-war era is represented by some of the unhealthy situations which lead to nearly worldwide economic stagnation and the spread of terrorism and ethnic wars, as I have just indicated. This would jeopardize all the achievements made by humankind in the scientific and technological fields, as well as with regard to the standards of social and economic development, and would lead to an historic era with negative consequences for the future. The disturbing economic situation in East Asia since the beginning of the financial crisis in the middle of 1997 has generated instability and created political and social upheavals in the region. In spite of the reform measures for economic stability by the concerned States in Asia, with the help of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, the success in restoring stability to the world economy was limited. In fact, we have begun to witness the repercussions of those measures on other economies which were previously immune from them. This is due to the fact that the efforts made were not coherent and did not address the urgent need to take a comprehensive view of the whole crisis, within an equitable international context. The events that I have outlined emphasize the need for collaborative efforts with a view to the establishment of a fair and equitable global economic system that would cover all goods, technologies and services. We believe that this should be linked to a new system of international financial markets which would be more transparent and efficient and thus responsive and adaptable to the changing financial conditions in the world markets. While I am not in a position to give concrete proposals here, we do feel that this session provides an appropriate opportunity for scrutinizing the global economic situation and for examining all problems and complications worldwide, thereby avoiding more problematic impacts from which the international community should be saved. This imposes on us the need to work harder, and work together, to face the challenges before us in order to restore confidence and return stability and normal growth to the global economy. We strongly condemn the terrorist bombing attacks on the United States embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es- Salaam, as well as the bombing incident in Cape Town, South Africa. We also deplore the assassination of the Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan. This wave of international terrorism and its rapid growth in an ugly and destructive form puts us all in a position of responsibility where we must work together to secure peace, tranquillity and stability, and employ all the measures that are necessary to the success of our endeavours in combating 10 terrorism. We believe that the measures which are now necessary to ensure that the perpetrators of those crimes and those who advocate their commission are brought to justice under the auspices of the United Nations. In this regard, we support the proposal made by the Arab Republic of Egypt and endorsed by the twelfth Summit of the Non- Aligned Movement held at Durban, South Africa, at the beginning of this month, to convene an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations in order to work out common arrangements that would express the reaction of the international community to the phenomenon of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We feel deep regret at the growing situation of famine among nations, which points out the inability of those countries to grow their natural resources owing to the failure of the developed countries to understand the real need for helping these people evolve the frameworks needed to operate and activate their national instrumentalities and to benefit from every assistance given to them. Since a number of United Nations agencies, such as United Nations Development Programme, have become unable to continue offering their expertise due to the shortage of financial resources, several developing countries were affected to the point that the implementation of important economic programmes in those countries has been seriously impeded. In other regions, ethnic conflicts have threatened to return the human family to the rule of the jungle and the legitimation of minority rule as based on injustice, oppression and a one-man rule, instead of the resort to international law, which is based on justice and equality of rights and common interests. If we look at the root causes, we find that most of the wealth is controlled by a few Governments. This factor is behind the ethnic, political and social conflicts which give rise to all forms of violence and terrorism. Only 14 months separate us from the next millennium. We had hoped that humankind would celebrate this historic occasion in an atmosphere of political and economic stability, free from violence, terrorism, poverty and “ethnic cleansing”. Thus, we should intensify our efforts to fight terrorism and violence in a framework of coordinated international efforts aimed at eradicating these unsettling phenomena, and to ensure that the perpetrators and advocates of such crimes are brought before the courts of justice. In this context, the Middle East continues to face a very serious political crisis as a result of the stalemate in the peaceful negotiations between the Arab countries and the Israelis under the sponsorship of the United States of America. The political stagnation caused by the Israeli Government and its non-compliance with the agreements that followed the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference under world sponsorship which led to the historic Oslo accord, and other agreements between the Government of Israel and the Palestinian National Authority have, in our view, thwarted world and regional efforts aimed at the restructuring of the Middle East region on the basis of a just and comprehensive peace leading to confidence- building and to hope for peaceful coexistence between the Arabs and the people of Israel. We cannot but wonder where we stand in relation to this goal. The Israeli Government’s plans aim at controlling the Arab lands occupied since 1967. These Israeli policies have hindered the concerted and intensified efforts exerted by the United States as a co- sponsor of the peace process. In addition, this has caused an atmosphere of suspicion to prevail among the Arab States as regards the genuine desire of the Israeli Government for peaceful coexistence and cooperation with the Arabs. The United Nations has been continuously discussing this issue since 1948 and has adopted many General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. Israel has not respected or implemented any of these resolutions, even once. These resolutions include Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which were adopted following the wars of 1967 and 1973. Israel has refused to implement these resolutions through the United Nations, insisting on unilateral negotiations outside the United Nations. The Arab countries responded positively and seriously to the calls for peace from various States by participating in the Madrid Peace Conference. The Arab countries have responded fully and positively to building a society based on peace in the Middle East. Despite all of this, the Israeli Government now refuses this proposal and continues to occupy and confiscate land in the West Bank. Is it justice that the world daily witnesses the expulsion of Palestinian citizens from their homes, the demolishing of their homes and the confiscation of their land? Is it justifiable for us to sit and witness the repeated violation by the Israeli authorities of the rights and 11 integrity of the Palestinians through the occupation and the siege of their towns and villages? Where is the just peace that we are talking about when the Israeli Government continues to build new and illegal settlements on Palestinian lands, while the Palestinians themselves are being prevented from building or even repairing their own homes? These measures are nothing but grave injustice. Can the United Nations condone such practices? Can the peace sponsors accept that? Where is the respect for human rights in the face of this denial of Palestinian rights when we are celebrating this year the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights? It is incumbent on all peace-loving nations which call for the implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to stand by the Palestinian cause and to reject the policies of the Israeli Government, which persists in trampling over the dignity of the Palestinian people. The establishment of peace in the Middle East requires the use of every convincing measure in order to make Israel accept and implement its legal and international obligations towards the Palestinian Authority, including withdrawal from the West Bank in accordance with the Oslo, Washington and Cairo accords. Israel also must resume negotiations with the Syrian Government from the point where they ended, with the ultimate goal of signing a peace treaty that will secure the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied Syrian territories to the line of 4 June 1967, as well as the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa, in accordance with resolutions 425 (1978) and 427 (1978). We believe that these are the necessary conditions for peace to prevail in the Middle East. They will also provide the legitimate necessary guarantees for Israel and foster an atmosphere of confidence among the Arab and the Israeli peoples. The Arab countries cannot accept the continued Israeli policy aimed at the Judaization of Arab Jerusalem, and they consider any change in the demographic composition of the Arab city of Jerusalem and the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories null and void. In spite of Israel’s intransigence and continued refusal to cooperate with the co-sponsors of the peace process in the Middle East to finalize this process and bring it to a conclusion, my country, believing in the significance and inevitability of peace in this region, declares in this forum its full support of the endeavours made by the co-sponsors, in particular those of the United States. In this regard, I would like to highlight the commendable role of the European Union and its continued economic support for the Palestinian National Authority. I call on the international community to extend every possible assistance to the Palestinian National Authority and its various educational, health and social institutions that will safeguard what is achieved in the context of this peace process. The decision by the Arab countries to follow the course of peace is a strategic option, and they have genuinely worked towards achieving this purpose based on their belief that for all the peoples of the region, including Israel, peace is required for prosperity and stability. Based on this, the Sultanate of Oman once again affirms its solidarity with the Palestinian people and supports the position of the Palestinian National Authority regarding the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the lands occupied since 1967, thus allowing the Palestinian National Authority to extend its control to all its lands, including the Holy City of Jerusalem. We stress the necessity for Iraq to fully implement all relevant Security Council resolutions to eliminate its arsenal of all weapons of mass destruction. Fully cognizant of the fact that the United Nations Special Commission has not been able to finalize its inspection, we call for persistent efforts to end the hardship borne by the fraternal Iraqi people. By the same token, we call upon the Secretary-General to intensify his efforts to find common ground for cooperation and to build confidence between the Special Commission and the Iraqi Government. We also call upon Iraq to cooperate fully with the ad hoc Tripartite Commission mandated to follow up on the issue of the prisoners of war and missing persons, either Kuwaitis or other nationalities, and to facilitate their release in order to end this tragedy for their families. In the Gulf region we are witnessing a new era of positive cooperation between the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the Islamic Republic of Iran. We welcome this significant development, which will encourage us to work in a genuine manner to create a propitious climate for enabling the United Arab Emirates to exercise its sovereign rights on the islands of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa. Moreover, we should be able to take the relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the GCC to a new level of cooperation on the basis of the principle of mutual benefit international law. 12 The efforts exerted in the field of disarmament aim to ensure international security and stability. My country has always expressed its unqualified support for these efforts. We also emphasize the need for taking practical measures to make the Middle East and the Gulf area zones free of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. The Sultanate of Oman signed the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1992 and acceded to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1997. I announce here that my country has decided to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). We look forward to seeing Israel take part in the efforts to make the Middle East a region free of nuclear weapons and to seeing it place all its nuclear facilities under the strict control and full safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency. With regard to the situation in Somalia, my country would like to commend the efforts by Egypt, as well as by Ethiopia and the neighbouring countries, to reconcile the Somalis and to convene a national reconciliation conference. We believe such a conference will help the Somalis rebuild their State in the national interest of the brotherly Somali people. We call upon the United Nations to extend tangible support to these efforts. As the world celebrates in 1998 the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, the Sultanate of Oman actively participated in the Diplomatic Conference to establish the International Criminal Court, which was held in Rome during June and July. We emphasize the need for this newly established Court to work in harmony and complementarity with national jurisdictions of Member States. We express our deep concern regarding the ongoing civil war in Afghanistan, which has resulted in the total destruction of that country and has intensified the suffering of its people. It has also had a serious negative impact on the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of this Muslim nation. We call upon all warring factions in Afghanistan to reconcile in a manner that will bring peace and stability to the people. In this regard, we would like to express our support of and appreciation for the initiatives of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan, headed by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi. The successive crises in the African continent have demonstrated the complexity of the political, economic and social situation therein. Rescuing Africa requires concerted international efforts to overcome its difficulties. In particular, African countries need international assistance to continue the process of reform and economic development. We believe that unified international action is necessary more than ever to support the United Nations coordination of efforts of the international donor organizations and the efforts on the regional level by the Organization of African Unity and the neighbouring countries in the areas of conflict with a view to promoting development and progress in the African continent. The current situation in Kosovo and the persecution and killings of the Albanian Muslims and others in this region have been deplored and denounced by the international community. We condemn the use of terrorism and violence in international relations as a mean to resolve political differences. We call for the containment and just settlement of this crisis. While realizing the national reasons why India and Pakistan each carried out its latest nuclear tests, we continue to call upon the two neighbouring countries to promptly sign the NPT and CTBT in order to prevent the escalation of the arms race in other regions of the world. We hope that the circumstances will allow them to do so. As the United Nations plays its role to eliminate all lethal weapons from this globe, my country would like to commend the international efforts that have led to the adoption in December 1997 of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. This achievement should alleviate the sufferings and spare the lives of thousands of innocent civilians who might fall victim to this kind of weapon. In the context of preserving the environment, the Sultanate of Oman has submitted a proposal to the regional organization for the protection of marine life in the Gulf to establish bunkering ports for oil tankers in order to protect the territorial waters and preserve the marine life in the region from pollution. On the economic front, the current situation has had a negative impact on economic growth in Oman, just as it has elsewhere in the world. But Oman is determined to proceed with its plans for economic diversification and harmonization with the regional and international economic environment. 13 On the national level, Oman has carried out the policies, legislation and other measures conducive to foreign investment, based on the principles of a market economy. At the regional level, my country participates actively in regional economic gatherings. Within the GCC, and thanks to the spirit of partnership among member States and the economic integration legislation, the rates of growth in the non-oil sectors have substantially increased. In the Indian Ocean Rim Association for regional cooperation, my country is an active participant in efforts to promote and invigorate economic trade cooperation. In this context, I would like to draw your attention to the investment by the Sultanate of Oman in infrastructure projects such as the port of Raysut in the southern region of Oman, Dhofar. This port will offer services to container ships and will enhance international maritime trade and transport in our region. At the international level, my country is working towards membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), and we are fully committed to taking the necessary steps to assure our full participation and responsibilities within that organization. The Sultanate of Oman thus works in a diligent and cooperative manner to promote the development of economic relations with other nations and with regional and international groupings for mutual benefit and the promotion of international trade and investment. The Sultanate of Oman stands ready to extend the hand of friendship to all peace-loving nations.  Allow me to congratulate the President of the General Assembly on his election and to wish him success in discharging his duties. I wish us all a constructive fifty-third session of the General Assembly. In 1995, the United Nations system commemorated its golden anniversary. This year, the United Nations celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This is a major accomplishment for humankind. The Declaration has inspired the development of a reliable and effective international system for the protection of human rights. At the time of the adoption of the Universal Declaration, Latvia was under Soviet occupation. The Soviet Union did not respect human rights, even though it participated in the preparation and adoption of the Declaration. I will mention one example among many violations of human rights: three and a half months after the adoption of the Declaration, the people of Latvia, including myself, experienced the largest of several deportations. Tens of thousands of people, even elderly people and children, were deported to the gulag. This left a lasting mark on the collective consciousness of the people of Latvia and significantly altered the demographic situation. During the period of occupation, the people of Latvia were unable to utilize fully the human-rights protection system of the United Nations. That situation changed as Latvia restored its independence. In the seven years since Latvia became a Member of the United Nations, it has benefitted from the moral and political support of the largest international organization. Immediately after the restoration of independence, our nation had to achieve the removal of a foreign military force. This process was helped by two General Assembly resolutions and the good offices of the Secretary-General. I am pleased to announce that less than a month ago the last military installation of the Russian Federation in Latvia â€” the early-warning radar station in Skrunda â€” was closed. This event illustrates that international institutions can constructively assist in the fulfilment of bilateral agreements. Cooperation between Latvia and the United Nations has been rich in accomplishments. The experience gained in the United Nations community has helped us in our democratic development. At present, Latvia is paying particular attention to economic and social development. Latvia is experiencing healthy economic growth at present. Latvia has one of the highest rates of growth in gross national product and one of the lowest rates of inflation among European Union candidate States. It has a balanced budget, and expects to have one next year also. This creates justifiable optimism that the process of accession to the European Union will continue successfully. The development of an integrated society is a national priority. This is a complicated task because the Soviet regime intentionally created a situation in which Latvians almost became a minority in their own country. Nevertheless, Latvia is dealing resolutely with this task. By the end of the year the Government will have completed the elaboration of a programme for the integration of society. This programme will stimulate the development of a civil society and provide more opportunities for the learning of the Latvian language. When implemented, the programme will permit all residents of Latvia to participate to an even greater extent than at present in public and civic life. Already Latvia ensures broad opportunities for the development of the culture of various ethnic groups and for education in their mother tongues. This past June, Latviaâs parliament adopted a far- reaching decision about changes in the citizenship law. Most of the major political forces support these changes in the citizenship law. Shortly, the people of Latvia will voice their opinion of these changes in a referendum. Cooperation with United Nations institutions, especially the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), has enhanced the social and economic welfare of Latviaâs inhabitants. The UNDP has helped our country resolve sensitive and important issues of integration. On behalf of the Government of Latvia, I would like to express gratitude for the assistance provided by the UNDP in enhancing the welfare of Latviaâs inhabitants. The successful cooperation should continue. The fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights spurs a consideration of Latviaâs possible contributions to the human-rights protection system. As a first-time member of the Commission on Human Rights beginning next year, Latvia will support the promotion of human rights as a priority of the United Nations, and the Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights as the primary institution for that task. Latvia believes that the priority role of human rights requires increased funding. Latvia has decided to continue to support financially the project for the development of national human rights institutions. On the country level, I may note the National Human Rights Office which has operated actively in our country for several years and which is the first institution of its kind in Central and Eastern Europe. The Office was established with the support of the United Nations. Latvia desires to continue this constructive cooperation with the United Nations. In support of the reform package proposed by the Secretary-General, the Government of Latvia will establish â€œUnited Nations Houseâ€. By the end of the year a building in Riga will be the home of five institutions of the United Nations system. It is significant that during the golden anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration, the United Nations diplomatic conference in Rome adopted a decision to establish an international criminal court. Latvia supports the establishment of an effective court and hopes that an overwhelming majority of United Nations Member States will do likewise. The best protection for human rights is a world in which peace and security prevail. The bipolar order, with its characteristic threats to peace and security, is gone. However, the world is still unsafe. International terrorism and crime are growing, access to weapons of mass destruction is growing, ethnic conflicts exist, and threats to the ecology of our planet are mounting. In order to solve these problems, the enhanced participation of the United Nations, including the Security Council, is essential. To fulfil its role effectively, the Security Council must reflect the real balance of the worldâs economic and social power and use skilfully the resources available to it. Latvia reiterates its continued support for an expansion of the Council that would result in the equitable representation of small States and all regional groups. As I speak from this rostrum, I appreciate the rare opportunity to address the shapers of world political opinion. We, the leaders of the United Nations Member States, must realize clearly that the highest mission of the United Nations is service to humankind. The United Nations should become a universal Organization. It will 2 retain credibility in the eyes of the world only if the results of its efforts are clearly evident. A prerequisite for this credibility is the ability to condemn and deter those who have violated internationally accepted norms of behaviour. The United Nations has shown the ability to do this on many occasions. I believe the time has come for world society to evaluate one of the most inhumane regimes of this century â€” Soviet totalitarianism. I take this opportunity to call upon victimized peoples to commence a joint effort to evaluate its legacy. The people of Latvia have endured the horrors of Soviet and Nazi occupations and therefore have the right to appeal to world society to do everything in its ability to avert the future appearance of similar scourges. We live in an era when the human mind has created much that is useful for promoting mutual respect and understanding in our everyday lives. I hope that the results of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly will be a lasting investment in shaping the United Nations for the next millennium.   Mr. President, allow me at the outset to express great pleasure at seeing you preside over the work of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. We are confident that under your able leadership the work of this session will be an unmitigated success. I can assure you of the cooperation and support of my country’s delegation throughout your stewardship of this session. Allow me also to pay a well-deserved tribute to our indefatigable Secretary-General and his staff for the efforts they are making, often under very trying conditions, to give meaning and concrete expression to the lofty ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. They deserve the full support and cooperation of all Member States and their peoples. As we approach the next millennium, we are fully conscious of the omnipresence of war and of the havoc it continues to wreak upon peoples in literally every continent of the world. It is true that local wars have so far not posed a serious threat to international peace and security, but by some accounts they have already killed and maimed more people than both world wars combined. And judging by the number of those who are killed in them and other attendant consequences, these wars, whatever their cause, are a living reality for those who fight in them and for the innocent people who are caught in the cross-fire. The conclusion we can draw is that not all succeeding generations of humankind have been spared the scourge of war in accordance with the promise made over 50 years ago by the founding fathers of this Organization. In terms of human history, 50 years is a relatively short time. It is, however, long enough to make the judgement that present-day human beings, like their predecessors in history, have failed to unlearn the ways of war — or rather to acquire the skills to live with one another like good neighbours. The presence of war and conflict among and within nations has often drawn a great deal of criticism to the United Nations, as if it had a magic wand to resolve every problem brought to its doorstep. True, there is room for improvement in the performance and efficacy of the United Nations. Certainly, the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 could have been avoided with more determination and foresight. Unfortunately, in awarding themselves certain extraordinary powers, the framers of the Charter built certain imperfections into the Organization which have proven to be serious encumbrances to its efficiency and effectiveness on conflict resolution. So long as this Organization remains the creation of the nation-State system with its in-built self-interest, it cannot be expected to perform differently. But we can certainly improve its delivery system to acceptable levels. Notwithstanding the imperfections of the United Nations, its continued existence is in the national interest of all Member States, whatever their claims to the contrary. Otherwise, Member States which felt they benefitted the least would long since have withdrawn their membership. Member States should therefore commit themselves to the payment of their contributions to the budget of the United Nations when they fall due, without any conditions. Ideally, the United Nations should have developed machinery to address and avert conflict situations before they actually occur. However, in the world in which we live, the ideal and the real do not often dovetail. Preventive diplomacy should quickly be succeeded by robust peacekeeping as soon as it is determined that a conflict situation is not amenable to resolution through dialogue. Preventive deployment has been put to use successfully in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the separation of belligerent forces has also been put to successful use to contain the otherwise explosive situations in Cyprus and Lebanon. The African experience in peacekeeping has been slightly different. In most cases, conflicts have smouldered and festered to calamitous proportions on our continent as a result of international inertia — or should we call it “Africa fatigue”? Liberia, Sierra Leone, the Great Lakes region and other cases are illustrative in this regard. African States are ready and willing to bear their fair share of peacekeeping operations on the continent, but they are certainly lacking in logistic and financial wherewithal. While there is ample scope for improvement in African peacekeeping capacity, Africa has over the years acquired practical experience both in the field and through cooperation with other countries. Thus, Africa has a relatively sophisticated capacity to carry out peacekeeping responsibilities. I must admit that it hurts my pride as an African to hear that African conflict situations dominate the agenda of the Security Council. This is a dubious honour, if indeed it is an honour at all. It must, however, be acknowledged that African problems are problems of the international community. They are problems of the United Nations, whose Charter is categorical in allocating primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. That responsibility was bestowed in trust. It cannot be shirked for political expediency in any part of the world. African conflicts deserve equal attention by this Organization, to which all African States belong and pay their dues, however modest. They cannot be left to the Africans alone to resolve. If I have devoted a great part of my address to the role of the United Nations in crisis management and in the defusing of tensions, it is not because I am oblivious to other equally pressing issues of our times. Crises and tensions, by their very nature, presuppose a lack of security, movement of people and, very often, deep-rooted intolerance. Evidently, when people raise swords against their neighbours, the humanness that is innate in all people is replaced by the bestiality that lies latent in every person. It is incomprehensible how the perpetrators of acts of genocide and other serious crimes against humanity manage to live with their consciences or to lead normal lives after such heinous criminal activities. The establishment last summer of the International Criminal Court will, we hope, help to ensure that perpetrators of acts of genocide, crimes against humanity and other inhuman acts will not go unpunished. The International Criminal Court will also, we hope, act as a deterrent for those intending to commit such serious crimes. The conviction by the Rwanda Tribunal of two leading personalities involved in acts of genocide in Rwanda in 1994 has also served notice to would-be perpetrators of similar acts that the international community can no longer tolerate their diabolical acts. Human rights abuse is equally intolerable and immoral. Institutions dealing with human rights should be empowered to deal with the perpetrators of human rights abuses with the full force of the law. Human rights abuse has been responsible for the bulk of the horrendous conflicts that have ravaged societies in all continents throughout this violent century. We therefore could not agree more with the Secretary-General when he says in his annual report on the work of the Organization, “If individual rights are not protected, the whole of society suffers. Personal freedoms are however rendered largely meaningless by civil wars, or by economic, social or cultural deprivation — often, indeed, by a combination of all these”. (A/53/1, para. 171) 2 Therefore, in this, the year of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the community of civilized nations to which we all belong must reaffirm its commitment to the human rights ideals enshrined in the Declaration and to their determination to live up to those ideals. Globalization and economic liberalization have brought about unprecedented expansion in world trade and commerce, but they have also accentuated the imbalances in international economic relations. The vast majority of countries, particularly in Africa, continue to face marginalization in the world economy. The problem is further compounded by the fact that official development assistance has fallen to unprecedentedly low levels. In Africa, armed conflicts have impacted negatively on development prospects. Corruption has also been one of the biggest obstacles to development. There is, however, reason for optimism. The majority of African countries have instituted reforms to achieve economic growth and development, including the application of sound macroeconomic policies, good governance, the rule of law and respect for human rights. They have taken serious measures to introduce budgetary reforms, remove restrictions on current payments and restrain credit and monetary expansion. Over the past few years Africa’s economic performance has been on an upward trend. In 1997 close to 60 per cent of the African countries registered growth rates in excess of their population growth rates, and about half of this number posted annual economic growth rates of more than 5 per cent. Africa, however, still needs active support and assistance from the international community. We clearly recognize that it is the primary responsibility of the Africans themselves to reduce the marginalization of their continent from the world economy. But for Africa to achieve any tangible success and emerge from the conditions of poverty and underdevelopment a new type of partnership with the developed world is required to increase trade and the continent’s share of global prosperity. African countries need improved access to world markets, greater flow of foreign direct investment, technology transfer and an increase in official development assistance. The decline in official development assistance needs to be reversed. Similarly, external debt is a problem requiring urgent attention. In fact, the debt burden continues to be one of the main obstacles to economic growth and development. The new initiative adopted by the Bretton Woods institutions to reduce the multilateral debt of the heavily indebted poor countries is a welcome development, though its implementation has been very disappointing and painfully slow. Botswana believes that the only viable solution to the debt problem faced by the poorest countries is outright cancellation of the debt. The main objectives of Botswana’s development strategy are employment creation and poverty alleviation. Lack of income is the most immediate cause of poverty among our people. Employment opportunities have increased significantly in the last few years, but the rate of unemployment is still unacceptably high. To improve the situation, Botswana has over the past few years undertaken measures to create a favourable environment for investment, including the encouragement of small and medium-scale enterprises. I am confident that with the support of our development partners our efforts will bear fruit. Before I conclude my statement, let me say a few words about recent events in southern Africa. On 16 September 1998 there was an attempt to put an end to the constitutional order in the Kingdom of Lesotho by overthrowing a democratically elected Government. Junior officers in the Lesotho Defence Force mutinied and arrested their senior officers, including the army commander. Government employees, including Cabinet Ministers, were stopped from going to work, which resulted in a complete collapse of the administrative order in the country. Criminal activity and lawlessness became the order of the day. There was no doubt that Lesotho was on the brink of widespread violence and total chaos. The crisis was most alarming because of its wider implications for peace and stability in the whole subregion of southern Africa. No effort was made by those involved to heed the calls for peaceful dialogue. Under the circumstances, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) could not remain indifferent. Therefore, on 21 September 1998 members of the Botswana Defence Force and the South African Defence Forces entered the Kingdom of Lesotho in response to an appeal for such intervention by the democratically elected Government of Lesotho. The intervention is aimed at assisting the people of Lesotho to create conditions conducive for them to address their differences in a peaceful manner. Our action conforms strictly to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, as well as the resolution of the 1997 Harare summit of the Organization of African Unity which condemns the overthrow of legitimate Governments by the military. 3 I wish to assure the Assembly that the military intervention by Botswana and South Africa in Lesotho is motivated solely by a sincere will to establish conditions of peace and security in our sister country. We are dealing with a difficult, complex and rapidly changing situation. As such, our forces shall remain in Lesotho for as long as necessary to restore public order and the rule of law. With regard to Angola, it has become increasingly clear that the leader of UNITA has no intention that it shall meet its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol. Given the renewed upsurge in violence caused by UNITA, SADC has come to the conclusion, regretfully, that Mr. Savimbi must be held personally responsible for war crimes that his movement has committed, and continues to commit even after it has signed a peace agreement. The people of Angola have suffered for far too long and it is time that this fratricidal war, which has devastated the country, was brought to an end. Across the border from war-weary Angola, another SADC country is going through a painful process of national rebirth, rudely interrupted two months ago by a rebellion which, even as we meet here, is ineluctably sapping the residual energy of a devastated country. The people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo deserve a break. Through the timely assistance rendered by three SADC countries at a time of great peril, it is our fervent hope that the Democratic Republic of the Congo will soon resume its process of rebirth and do so in peace and tranquillity. Let me conclude by assuring you, Mr. President, and the nations gathered here that Botswana’s faith in the United Nations as the universal repository of the hopes and aspirations of all mankind remains as strong as ever. We will continue to work assiduously for the enhancement of the efficacy of the Organization, to help equip it for the arduous tasks that lie ahead.  My delegation would like first of all to congratulate the President on his assumption of the presidency for this session. We know full well that the tasks that lie ahead are indeed challenging, but we are confident that with his vast experience and wisdom he will discharge his responsibilities successfully. Whilst we wish him luck, let me also reassure him of the full cooperation of our delegation at all times. In the same vein, we would also like to congratulate his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for the admirable manner in which he conducted the activities of the Assembly during the fifty-second session. My delegation is very proud of Mr. Kofi Annan, our able Secretary-General, for the efficient manner in which he has been running the affairs of our Organization. His impressive contributions in the field of preventive diplomacy, as amply demonstrated on numerous occasions, are worthy of praise. Likewise, in the delicate business of reforms he is equal to the task, for no sooner did he assume office than he embarked on the reform of the United Nations. His success is our success, and therefore we will lend him our full support in our common endeavour to revitalize the Organization and make it more relevant to the realities of these changing times. We in the Gambia have also been busy with the transformation of our own society under the dynamic and enlightened leadership of President Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh, whose ideal it is to serve the youth and people of Africa by endeavouring to help them to realize their 23 aspirations for peace, stability and justice and progress in socio-economic development. Since we renewed our new democratic tradition, every effort is being made to consolidate this process in an orderly way, mindful of the fact that better and lasting results will be achieved only through a systematic approach. Moreover, cultivating democracy in the midst of poverty is not an easy task because democracy is, after all, about participation. If the basic needs of the people are not satisfied, they are simply not interested in any political process. Conscious of this hard reality, the Government of President Jammeh quickly put in place a programme of socio-economic development to empower the people and their families, placing great emphasis on social sectors such as health, education and agriculture. In this way, an impressive number of schools have been built around the country, and now we can boast of providing schools for all communities in the Gambia. Health facilities are within reach of all Gambians and are also affordable. May I at this juncture, on behalf of my Government, express our most sincere gratitude to the Governments of those friendly States — in particular, the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Cuba, Egypt and the Republic of China on Taiwan — for the medical assistance they continue to give us during these times of need. This is a meaningful SouthSouth cooperation worthy of emulation. I am only attempting to share our perception of what inter-State relations should be: caring, sharing, consulting and cooperating for the mutual benefit of all. I cannot think of a better way of cooperation between States for mutual economic development in a world in which the gap between the rich and the poor continues to expand. Now, whilst we are concerned with bridging this gap, we are overwhelmed by another hurricane-like phenomenon, called globalization and liberalization. Globalization and liberalization were recognized by many to hold many attractions. They were perceived to be the gateway to the integration of developing countries into the global economy. We however observe that while they are yielding ample benefits for developed countries, they have further widened the gap between developed and developing countries, as well as the inequality gap between rich and poor. Their impact on employment and socioeconomic development in general has been largely negative. We are concerned at this growing marginalization of the least developed countries in world trade. The volume of our total exports continues to be under 0.4 per cent of global exports. Increased globalization is further worsening the situation. This negative trend merits coordinated action to alleviate the situation. In this context, we welcome the General Assembly’s decision to hold the first high-level dialogue for two days earlier this month on the theme of the social and economic impact of globalization and interdependence and their policy implications. We hope that this meeting will have brought about active engagement of both developed and developing countries, in a spirit of genuine partnership, with a view to reaching a meaningful and successful conclusion and strengthening international economic cooperation for development. Globalization and liberalization must be managed through concerted international effort in order to avoid the further marginalization of developing countries. The overwhelming burden of external debt today poses one of the most challenging and daunting problems for developing countries. Much has been said about this, and very little has been done to alleviate the problem. We believe that there is a dire need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries, in addition to debt relief measures that include cancellation and concessional financial assistance to enable developing countries to reduce their debt overhang. In this context, we welcome the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and encourage early and urgent application of its measures. We would also encourage any refinements of the initiative to reduce the structural adjustment period to three years, to increase the debt reduction level to 90 per cent and to ease the terms for reduction of multilateral debt. The least developed countries have always received the attention and support of the international community, particularly with the adoption of the Paris Declaration and Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s. The realization of the primary objectives of the Programme — to arrest and reverse the deterioration in the socio-economic conditions in the least developed countries — so far remains elusive. The lack of progress in this regard is attributable in the main to the failure of the international community to fulfil its commitments. We hope that the declaration of the ministers of least developed countries at this year’s session will encourage our development partners to come forward and work with us in a genuine partnership. Poverty, deprivation and environmental degradation are the greatest evils facing developing countries today. 24 We agree with the analysis of the Secretary-General in his report on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa, in particular with regard to the interrelationship between development and peace. Today, the world is besieged with conflicts, both interand intra-State. From the Balkans to the Great Lakes region, human beings continue to prey on one another with guns and knives, machetes and all other sorts of weapons. Unfortunately, women and children suffer the most from these conflicts. We cannot continue to allow this to go on. The time has come when people have to take individual responsibility for crimes they have committed against humankind. Ethnic violence and human rights abuses, a common feature of present day conflicts, cannot be countenanced and cannot be committed with impunity. My delegation supports fully the resolve of the international community to deal with the problem, and in this context welcomes the establishment of the International Criminal Court. We share the philosophy of Benjamin B. Ferencz, a former Nuremberg prosecutor, that “there can be no peace without justice, no justice without law, and no meaningful law without a court to decide what is just and lawful under any given circumstances”. The establishment of the International Criminal Court will ensure that henceforth humanity’s response to crimes against humanity will be swift and will be just. Henceforth, no army, no ruler, no junta anywhere can abuse human rights with impunity. The people and the Government of the Gambia look forward to the coming into effect of the statute of the International Criminal Court. One of the most cherished aspirations of our Organization is to ensure that all men live in peace. The attainment of international peace and security therefore remains one of the most vital preoccupations of our noble Organization. It is for these reasons that my delegation joins the rest of the international community in supporting the efforts of the United Nations to ensure peace and the resolution of conflicts around the world. My delegation would like to take this opportunity to commend the members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and its Military Observer Group (ECOMOG) and other regional and subregional arrangements in Africa and beyond for the good work they continue to do in their bid to ensure peace and security. My delegation is particularly thankful to ECOWAS for the restoration on 10 March 1998 of the legitimate and constitutionally elected Government of Sierra Leone. We are still concerned that the rebels have up to this moment refused to lay down their arms. We urge the international community to assist the Government of Sierra Leone in its effort to restore control over all its territory and to concentrate its energies on national reconciliation, reconstruction and economic development. In this regard, my delegation welcomed the holding of the Special Conference on Sierra Leone that was held here in New York at the initiative of the Secretary-General and which we hope will contribute to the process of national reconciliation. In neighbouring Guinea-Bissau, we hope that the joint peace initiative of ECOWAS and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries will bear fruit, leading to a final settlement of the dispute. In this context, we recognize the need to respect the ceasefire agreed upon in Praia, Cape Verde, on 26 August 1998, which we consider to be an important step in enhancing peace and security in the West African subregion. The Government of the Gambia is concerned over the number, intensity and interrelationship among conflicts in Africa, and especially at the emergence of new conflicts during the past year. The border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, the resurgence of conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the impasse in the peace process in Angola, the continued violence by the rebels in Sierra Leone, and the complex humanitarian emergencies in Guinea-Bissau, Somalia and Sudan, among other problems, cause grave concern to us. In addition to what I have just said, we are also concerned at the difficulties attendant upon the present conflict situations in Africa, in particular human rights abuses, refugee outflows and the humanitarian needs of innocent persons affected by such conflicts, in particular women and children. The international community, in responding to these conflict situations, must address these issues and the root causes of the conflicts, including in particular the troubling issues of children in armed conflict and the flow of small arms. In this context, my delegation welcomes the actions taken by the Security Council to address these issues following the report of the Secretary-General on Africa. We hope that there will be a United Nations-wide approach to tackle these important issues. 25 The Lockerbie issue has dragged on for too long. It is about time that a settlement was reached so that the people of the great Libyan Arab Jamahiriya can be relieved of the bite of the excruciating sanctions imposed against them. In accordance with the position taken by the Organization of African Unity, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the League of Arab States and other regional organizations, the Government of the Gambia welcomes the concurrence of the Governments of the United Kingdom and of the United States of America to the proposal to have the two Lockerbie suspects tried in a neutral country, the Netherlands. Consequently, the Government of the Gambia reaffirms its full support for the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya in its bid to secure a fair and just trial for the two suspects. In the light of the recent developments, in the quest to alleviate the immense suffering caused by the economic sanctions imposed on the Libyan nation by Security Council resolutions 748 (1992) and 883 (1993), and to avert any further tightening of sanctions on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the Government of the Gambia is desirous of the urgent finalization of the arrangements for a lasting solution to this long-drawn-out problem. Following a review, therefore, of the latest correspondence on the matter between the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the Secretary-General, and the agreement concluded between those two countries and the Government of the Netherlands relating to arrangements for the transfer of the suspects to the Netherlands and their trial there, the Government of the Gambia is of the view that the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya must be given the opportunity to make an assessment of those documents in order to ensure that its views and concerns are fully taken into consideration with regard to the final arrangements. Whilst acknowledging the great lengths that all parties have gone to in order to ensure that justice is meted out — and this at the earliest possible opportunity — my country firmly believes that Libya should have a greater input into the final arrangements regarding the hand-over of the two Lockerbie suspects and, most important, that the appropriate guarantees for a just and fair dispensation of justice should prevail. This would be in the spirit of the decision taken in Ouagadougou by the heads of State of the Organization of African Unity at their last summit. My Government would like to see justice done and the real culprits in the Lockerbie bombing identified and brought to trial very quickly. However, whilst we persist in urging that Libya be associated fully in the quest for mutually acceptable conditions of transfer of the two suspects to the Netherlands and trial there, we will also insist on the need to have all the proof of their direct involvement in this tragic affair being provided to us in the first place. As soon as a reasonable and acceptable terrain d’entente is reached, the sanctions must be lifted immediately and unconditionally. The Gambia’s foreign policy is directed by its national interest and that of the continent, as well as by the quest for peace and justice in the world. As members of the Security Council, we are obliged to ask some pertinent questions when certain actions and initiatives have a devastating impact on the lives of human beings. One such issue for which we would want straightforward and clear answers relates to the recent bombing by the Government of the United States of a pharmaceutical complex in Khartoum. What my Government seeks to know in this respect is whether, assuming in good faith that the complex was indeed involved in the production of deadly and prohibited substances, the Government of the United States fully weighed the consequences of such a terrible strike on the innocent people of the Sudan before sanctioning the bombings. In other words, in the view of the United States Government, did the satisfaction derived from the destruction of the complex in the Sudan outweigh the value and premium placed on the lives of innocent men, women and children on the scales of their moral values? This matter has to be investigated so that the international community’s conscience may be at peace. About the Middle East, we are disappointed that the peace process, which gave so much hope, has virtually collapsed. This undesirable state of affairs does not diminish our faith in the peace process. We recognize the right of all peoples to self-determination. We therefore respect the rights of the Palestinian people to emerge fully as an independent sovereign State. In this context, we welcome the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 52/250 on the participation of Palestine in the work of the United Nations. We look forward to the day when Palestine joins the ranks of other States as a fully fledged Member of the United Nations. It is the wholehearted belief of my delegation that every people has a right to self-determination. This belief inspires the Gambia’s strong support for the aspirations of the 21.3 million people of the Republic of China on 26 Taiwan to exercise their right to share and participate in the activities of the United Nations. The legitimacy of their aspirations, both legal and moral, has been reinforced by similar actions and measures taken by the United Nations on the issue of parallel representation, which now stands as a useful reminder. We believe, in the same vein, that the people of Cuba have an inalienable right to determine their destiny. The practice of unilateral imposition of sanctions by one Member State against another should end with the demise of the cold war. As we enter the new millennium, all States should be committed to shaping a better world, a world wherein all States, big or small, are equal, a world in which relations between States are based on mutual respect and strict observance of international law. The situation between Iraq and Kuwait continues to be one of the most important issues before the United Nations. We would wish to stress the need to have this matter resolved expeditiously. We hope that those who have influence on Iraq will be able to secure its compliance with its international obligations and that it will resume cooperation with the United Nations and its bodies. In this respect, we urge the release of all prisoners of war, including missing Kuwaiti nationals and third country nationals. We encourage sincere cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross for that purpose. We also call for the return of the properties of the Government of Kuwait, including official documents removed from their national archives. My delegation is also concerned about the humanitarian situation in Iraq and the dire plight of the Iraqi people. We encourage Iraq to cooperate fully with the United Nations, which would end the present logjam and pave the way for a comprehensive review of the sanctions. All of us remain concerned about the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. We believe that there is no military solution to the conflict there. We urge all Afghan factions to find a political settlement to the conflict, under the auspices of the United Nations, which addresses all the interests and concerns of all the people of Afghanistan. Let me at this juncture reiterate my Government’s condemnation of the killing of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan. We hope that the perpetrators of this heinous crime will be pursued and brought to justice. As we approach the new millennium, we are confronted with long-drawn-out conflicts and new ones that are emerging. Our world is thus far from being a peaceful and quiet place. At this stage in our history, we must all strive to enter the twenty-first century as a united, peaceful family that can proudly bequeath to future generations a developed, secure world where democracy, justice and equality are guaranteed to everyone, irrespective of origin, race, religion or political persuasion. We hope that the Proclamation of the year 2000 as the International Year for the Culture of Peace, which was first suggested by the Gambia during the 1997 session, will bear fruitful results. Apart from the numerous conflicts, old and new, my delegation is also concerned about the drug menace, which threatens the very fabric of our societies. This problem has now assumed monumental proportions, leaving no society safe from its lethal and tenacious tentacles. We believe that all of us have a stake in this problem — big and small States alike. We must therefore join forces as a common front in our battle against this evil. The Government of the Gambia is committed to curbing the problem of drugs in its territory and will continue to cooperate with all countries in that regard. The Government of the Gambia welcomed the twentieth special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem held in New York from 8 to 10 June 1998. We also fully support the Political Declaration, the Declaration of the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction and the action plans adopted at the special session. We wish to reiterate our concern for the growing and dangerous links between terrorist groups, drugtraffickers and their paramilitary gangs, which have resorted to all types of violence, thereby undermining the democratic institutions of States and violating human rights. In addition to the drug menace, the international community is faced with another challenge: international terrorism. The Government of the Gambia condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. While we again extend our sympathy to the injured and to the families bereaved as a result of the recent bombings in Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa, we call on all countries to work together to fight against the scourge of terrorism. 27 The issue of anti-personnel landmines and its attendant consequences is of concern. My delegation welcomes the coming into force of the Ottawa treaty banning antipersonnel landmines. With the end of the cold war, nuclear disarmament should be given priority in our efforts to ensure the safety of humankind. In this context, my delegation is encouraged by what India and Pakistan said about signing the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We join those who call for a negotiated and phased programme for the complete elimination, by all countries, of nuclear weapons. In order for us all to enter into the new millennium with our collective vision for a better world, we will obviously need to reform and revitalize our Organization to make it more relevant and more responsive to the challenges of contemporary times. This idea has indeed taken hold, leading to the consideration of reform measures proposed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his report “Renewing the United Nations: A programme for reform”. May I take this opportunity to pay tribute to our able Secretary-General for his unswerving commitment to the reform of our Organization and his cooperation in this regard. It is our fervent hope that the success of any reform programme for the United Nations will be judged by the ability of the Organization to make a significant impact on the lives of all people, in particular those of the developing countries, as well as by real improvements in its functioning. In this context, we feel very strongly that reform measures should focus mainly on strengthening the role of the Organization in the promotion of peace and development. Any such reform programme should address the need to enable the Organization to meet the challenges of modern times and preserve the sanctity and centrality of the principles of the Charter. The last session witnessed a lot of debate on this issue. It is sad to note, however, that no substantial progress has been made. As we pursue this important task, we hope that the Assembly will defeat the hostile offensive which seeks to portray it as a “house of words”. Any concrete and workable decisions that may evolve out of our deliberations on this issue will serve as the litmus test of the political will of the membership to forge ahead with genuine renewal and revitalization of the Organization. No reform of the United Nations would be complete without the reform of the Security Council — the main organ responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security. While some consensus has emerged on a number of issues on the question of equitable representation and increase in the membership of the Security Council, important differences still exist on many other issues. We urge Member States to continue to negotiate constructively on the outstanding issues with a view to arriving at a compromise that is agreeable, if not satisfactory, to all. Finally, as we continue to grapple with the reform of the United Nations and its organs after 50 years of operation, so must we also continue to address the weaknesses, inequalities and inadequacies that plague the international economic and social system, global trade, finance, investment, international development, and so on. We must continue to do this so as to achieve more meaningful cooperation and partnership geared towards the promotion of socio-economic development and the preservation of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. It therefore bears recalling that the important issues of women in development and the rights of the child should continue to be at the top of the international agenda. In this endeavour, development must be given the priority it deserves. Africa, Asia and Latin America must be given the opportunity to emerge from their devastating past into a future which guarantees for them all the benefits of democracy and peace, respect for human rights, development and the restoration of the dignity of all their peoples. This objective is realizable if we all work together, drawing inspiration from the Charter of the United Nations. North and South, rich and poor, together we can do it — if we believe in it. The United Nations provides the forum and the necessary framework to achieve the objectives that we set for ourselves on this small planet that we share. Before the United Nations was founded, the world experienced bitterly two devastating wars. When the United Nations was founded half a century ago, it helped to avoid another global war despite the cold war that ensued. Today, in this post-cold-war era in which we are confronted with localized ethnic and internal political strife, we need the United Nations more than ever before. This world body has withstood the test of time and history. There is no alternative to the United Nations; countries big and small, rich or poor, all have a vital 28 stake in strengthening the United Nations rather than weakening it. The United Nations is more relevant today than it has ever been, and we all should strive for its vitality and the respect of its decisions. We can do this only when it is clear in the minds of all that it is the common house of all the States of the world and that it should be perceived as being just and fair to all, in particular in the resolutions adopted by its Security Council. These resolutions should always be in the spirit of fraternal cooperation and understanding that prevail here in this General Assembly Hall. We in the Gambia remain very optimistic, and we know we share this optimism because the General Assembly is the asylum of humanity at large against the cruelty and pain of the outer world. It is not without some emotion that I appear before this Assembly both as Head of State of Burkina Faso and current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), to extol, here in this sanctuary of nations, peace and harmony between human beings. To promote peace and security for our era and for future generations is the objective of the nations of the world gathered here. It is also the message which I bring on behalf of Africa, being convinced that, armed with this immense hope, the Organization for African Unity and the United Nations, intimately linked, can make a reality of humanity’s legitimate aspiration to a better destiny. But first, I should like to congratulate you, Sir, as well as the other members of the Bureau, upon your election and the confidence placed in you to bring the work of this fifty-third session to a successful conclusion. I also congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Udovenko, on the energy with which he discharged his duties. Mr. Secretary-General, I would like to address my congratulations to you and your staff on the work you have done in so little time and offer my encouragement 16 for the battles still to be won. It is entirely to the credit of the whole United Nations system that it carries the torch of peace higher every day. The century which is drawing to its close will be remembered as one of great challenges. Seriously shaken by the two world conflicts, it also mustered the necessary resources to sound the death knell of colonialism and apartheid. The liberation of colonized peoples and territories was historically necessary to ensure greater justice, tranquillity and well-being for our civilization, a civilization which finally understood that its survival lay in the organization of a genuine collective security. But the cold war, which led to bipolar confrontation exacerbated by ideological antagonism, made this security illusory. International peace and security have not been consolidated with the end of the cold war. Conflicts and disturbances which no authority could contain quickly followed. The resurgence of these crises and the inadequacy of the solutions proposed to resolve them bring to mind the plight of the Danaïdes, those mythological beings who were condemned to fill up a bottomless barrel. The international community’s failure to restore peace to Somalia and to prevent genocide in Rwanda will stand out in the history of the African continent. This failure has undoubtedly greatly contributed to awakening our somewhat lethargic consciences and forcing us to confront ourselves. It has revealed to Africa, which may still have had its doubts, the limitations of the United Nations. The twentieth century thus ends with this acknowledgement, which, though shocking for more than one reason to those still lulled by the illusions of an age-old humanism, is at least realistic and belongs to the new era that is beginning. It is an acknowledgment that the United Nations, to which Africa has given so much, cannot do everything for the continent in its struggle to quell the numerous hotbeds of tension and ensure its development. The conclusion to be drawn from this fact is self-evident: Africa must recognize this reality and come to terms with it. The thirty-fourth Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, held in Ouagadougou on 8-10 June 1998, devoted the thrust of its deliberations to this new reality, which challenges and commands Africa to take control of its own destiny. Assessing the scope and importance of the responsibilities this entails, and which are theirs to assume, the heads of States took the decision to affirm their common will to focus fully — more than in the past — on the prevention, management and resolution of African conflicts. This commitment will certainly ensure greater visibility both for the Organization of African Unity and for the continent’s various regional organizations in their search for peaceful solutions to these conflicts. Though Africa’s experience in taking control of its own affairs is still quite recent, encouraging results have been recorded in the management and resolution of certain conflicts, results which deserve to be saluted here. The task, therefore, is not beyond the capacity of Africans. It is my ardent wish that this experience be extended to the whole continent, to the most ancient crises as well as the most recent. From north to south, from east to west, Africa must henceforth more systematically involve itself in the management and settlement of conflicts wherever prevention was not enough, where it did not succeed in guaranteeing peace. To this end, initiatives to strengthen the continent’s capacity to respond quickly to crises have been generated by Africans themselves. The advantage they have over all other initiatives is that they are African. In order to be developed and implemented, they need the unequivocal support of the international community. Subregion by subregion, they need to be developed, without exception and in harmony. Preventing, managing and resolving the conflicts in Africa, whose number and complexity are increasingly disturbing, requires solid and reliable mechanisms, appropriate to local conditions, mechanisms dedicated to the cause of peace, without which Africa cannot undertake sustainable development. Clearly, the world’s problems are immense, complex and alarming. The extreme difficulty of dealing with the establishment of peace in isolation gives multilateral diplomacy an ever-growing role in the resolution of conflicts. The United Nations and regional organizations such as the Organization of African Unity can bring a great deal to this task. The OAU, for example, possesses a Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and 17 Resolution. Created in Cairo in 1993, this Mechanism, whose effectiveness and practicality we are working to ensure, should to be the crucible in which a genuine preventive diplomacy can be forged. That is all the more imperative since the consequences of conflicts, whether internal or international, are always devastating. At the institutional level, therefore, we are equipped to respond to conflicts, and we also have the will to do so, for, as I emphasized during the thirty-fourth OAU summit, “the issue of security and peace in Africa is primarily of concern to Africans. No mechanism has any chance of succeeding effectively over time if it is imposed from outside.” Of course, external solidarity, if it is sincere, will always be welcome, given that in such a complex and changing field concerted and resolute action can only be beneficial. I have already emphasized that the management of conflict situations often requires the deployment of a level of human, material and financial resources beyond the capacities of our countries. Thus, international organizations should continue to show solidarity and partnership with Africa. I therefore call upon the United Nations, with its wealth of experience, to contribute not only to strengthening structurally the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution in Africa, but also to provide technical and logistical support, since in the end we share the same ideal: assuring for our world the security and peace essential to its development and flourishing. In this test of international solidarity, one thing is certain: Africa must definitively and first of all rely upon itself. We Africans are aware that in order to be masters of our destiny we must forge it ourselves. In response to this imperative no sacrifice has been spared by any State of our continent to establish an internal climate that is conducive to growth and sustainable development. After the years of uncertainty and stagnation, Africa has entered a new era, marked by clear economic recovery in the wake of bold reforms and characterized by greater austerity and rationality in the management of public and State affairs. This movement towards transparency in management and good governance has been accompanied by the establishment of homogeneous subregions in which the common destiny of Africans is daily forged, thanks to the sustained harmony of our principles and policies of integration, the ultimate objective of which is the establishment of an African economic community in the first half of the twenty-first century. At present Africa faces two challenges: peace and political stability on the one hand, and sustainable development on the other. In their struggle and daily efforts to emerge from underdevelopment, African Governments and peoples are not alone. They know how to rely on the sincere support of their friends. This includes the operational development system of the United Nations, which I should like to commend for its dedication to the uplifting struggle against poverty and other forms of deprivation that afflict African peoples. It is therefore regrettable that the United Nations agencies that are at the heart of the struggle for human security in Africa — such as the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Children’s Fund, to cite only two examples — are seeing their financial resources slowly dwindle while the mission entrusted to them calls for a redoubling of efforts and resources. That is why I call upon all to demonstrate their goodwill by contributing to the operational development system of the United Nations the resources it needs in order to assist Africa in confronting the challenges of peace and development. The same goes for the question of debt. It would be desirable for the eligible countries to have their debt rescheduled at the same time as they are initiating reforms. It hardly needs recalling that debt is an unbearable burden for our still fragile economies. Globalization offers us the means and advantages required to succeed in the boldest undertakings, provided that we clearly define our objectives and involve our peoples in the challenge of propelling Africa along the path of progress. It is incontrovertible that globalization, which implies a spirit of partnership, limits the independence and initiatives of States. But can humanity continue to flourish if the gap between rich and poor nations, between the affluent and the destitute within the same nation, grows inexorably? The time has therefore come to rethink seriously the responsibility of international institutions in the regulation of the globalized economy in order to ensure a balance between economic growth and social prosperity. To do 18 that, it is more than indispensable and more than timely to engage in a restructuring of the United Nations, and especially of the Security Council, in order to make it a true instrument for the application of the principles of justice, equity and democracy. Africa accounts for one third of the Members of the United Nations. That is why it is unacceptable that, after more than 50 years of our Organization’s existence, an entire continent — Africa — should be absent from the permanent membership of the Security Council, which, paradoxically, debates problems that are for the most part African. If the United Nations were to apply the principle of equity, would the sanctions against the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya continue despite the opinion of the International Court of Justice and, above all, despite the decisions and resolutions of heads of State in the Organization of African Unity, the League of Arab States, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement calling for those sanctions to be lifted? Today Security Council resolution 1192 (1998) has underscored the primacy of law for resolving this dispute, and the majority of nations within our world Organization hope that conditions of transparency will be met so that the trial can be concluded, in the interest of the victims and the Libyan people. Moreover, Africa hopes that the Security Council will dispatch a mission of inquiry to the Sudan in the wake of the bombing of the pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum. Africa forcefully condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and calls upon our world Organization to create the necessary conditions for a frank debate of this issue and for strong and concerted action against this phenomenon, while keeping in mind that unresolved angers and frustrations born of economic or historical conditions restrict our capability to act. In the same vein, can the United Nations continue to deny the legal and international reality of a State such as the Republic of China on Taiwan, whose 22 million women and men are excluded from making any contribution to the activities of our Organization? I am among those who believe that Africa is on the path of hope. I remain convinced that the economic, political, cultural and social obstacles that confront Africa call forcefully for its children to rediscover the road to unity that will allow them to take effective control of their destiny. Without union, Africa will remain on the periphery of history. Common sense tells us that we Africans must once and for all rid ourselves of that image of the outstretched hand that bedevils us and build the covenants of friendship, dignity and pride that will confer so much solidarity and generosity. This quest for independence does not deny the importance of solidarity among peoples. It means reaching a new understanding of human rights and the rights of peoples; it means taking on the responsibility of knowing how to remain ourselves. First of all, I would like to express to Mr. Didier Opertti the sincere congratulations of the delegation of Equatorial Guinea on his unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session of the General Assembly. I also wish to congratulate Ambassador Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine and to express my appreciation for the enormous amount of work he accomplished as President at the last session. May I also reiterate to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, our brother Kofi Annan, my country’s support for the efforts he is making to find viable solutions to conflicts in various parts of the world, and particularly in Africa. I would like to encourage him to continue with the reforms he has undertaken to adapt and restructure the United Nations. Once again, we are gathered here to consider and reflect on the great challenges humanity is confronting and will have to continue to confront at the threshold of the new millennium. Every year in this same forum we see that the same causes produce the same effects, but solutions are slow to arrive. The fact is that we are all victims of our own contradictions. From this rostrum, we have been repeating for the past 50 years that humankind wants no more wars, that it wants a lasting peace. Nevertheless, the large industrial complexes continue to produce more weapons that are increasingly sophisticated and deadly. We are assured that the priority at the end of the century is the fight against poverty and the underdevelopment of nations in the framework of the globalization of our economies. Yet the problems of hunger, malnutrition, disease and unemployment are assuming alarming proportions, and in many cases the growth of these problems is even more apparent than in the past. In the meantime, the peoples of the world continue to wait, and their future is filled with uncertainty. Let us be honest: disarmament is possible only if the large weapons-producing complexes are dismantled. To claim the contrary is pure contradiction. Disarmament requires the same approach as the fight against drugs — in other words, the destruction of the centres of production, distribution and sale. There is no need for me to elaborate on this issue, since the solution is in the hands of those who benefit from this illicit trade. However, I do wish to refer to two questions that are the subject of debate at this session of the General Assembly: the phenomenon of globalization and the fight against terrorism. In connection with the former, we have serious doubts and questions regarding the sincerity of this dialogue among nations. On the one hand, we have those who offer many pretexts for continuing to obstruct free trade, the free circulation of goods and persons and the transfer of technology, and who erect other barriers that prevent the developing countries from achieving sustainable economic growth. As for the African continent, we all know that the Uruguay Round is an instrument for marginalizing the developing countries, nor are we unaware that the payment of foreign debt remains a means of exporting capital precisely to those who do not need it. Under these circumstances, how can we devise an agenda for the globalization of economic relations between the developed 17 North and the developing South, in a framework of fairness? Globalization must begin with fair prices for our raw materials. The immense opportunities and advantages offered to the world markets by the developing countries of Africa must be put to use in the context of a sincere partnership between North and South. No one has chosen marginalization. The question is, should it be forced on us? Some detractors of the African continent apply simplistic reasoning when they categorically state that the principle causes of poverty and marginalization in Africa are political in nature: poor governance, corruption and armed conflict. Without trying to discard these arguments, we believe that they do not justify the unfair treatment of our raw materials in the most profitable markets of the North. Nor do we believe that the marginalization now suffered by the African continent is an inevitable phenomenon. A great deal is being done to inscribe our countries in the current agenda of globalization. The ongoing processes of subregional and regional integration are evidence of the political will that today infuses African leaders. We wonder about the degree of sincerity and transparency in the dialogue aimed at facilitating the full integration of the African economies into the mechanisms for globalization of trade and into technological advances. As for globalization, it should mean that everyone sells what he has and wherever he wishes, without the customs, administrative and tariff barriers that today prevent the free access of the products of the South to the markets of the North. Furthermore, the ever present issue of foreign debt remains an obstacle to economic growth in many developing countries. My country, Equatorial Guinea, sincerely believes that this situation is not fortuitous, and far less is it due to a lack of potential or a lack of opportunity. What we call for is not simply assistance. We want our own efforts to be valued; we want use to be made of the various opportunities we can offer to the world of globalization that lies ahead. Nevertheless, all of this also requires the peace and socio-political stability of nations. Unfortunately, it would seem that everything is being done to create instability in our countries. Today, we are seriously threatened from outside and within our borders by terrorism and mercenary actions carried out by individuals or groups blinded by hunger for power, ethnic hatred, racism and the desire for hegemony. For the first time in its history, my country has experienced, in the course of the past 18 months, two acts of armed destabilization. One was on 17 May 1997, when a ship carrying arms and mercenaries was detained by the Angolan police in its territorial waters. The other was on 21 January of this year, when a group of individuals attacked a number of towns in my country and murdered six persons in cold blood. What justification can there be for terrorist actions such as those perpetrated against the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania? What justification can there be for a band of terrorists who murder peaceful citizens in cold blood? What political claims can justify the murder and mutilation of another human being, as occurred in my country? On this question, some countries present here are acting with a double standard; depending on their own interests, terrorist actions are justifiable or not. When these actions take place within a developing country, some powerful communications media invoke, among other such fallacies, the “struggle for the freedom of peoples” to do away with regimes that, according to them, are dictatorial. But when similar actions of the same type take place in any country of the North, then the story changes, and those responsible for such actions are called terrorists and enemies of society. That double standard was evident when such actions received the support and solidarity of certain Spanish political groups and elements of the Spanish communications media. Only the Government of that country condemned those acts. On the other hand, a lobby was formed from among several political parties — the Basque Nationalist Party, the United Left and the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party — each of which published communiqués expressing their solidarity with the perpetrators of those terrorist acts. Since then, those same groups have been trying to fabricate an ethnic problem in my country. They have promoted a number of resolutions against my country in various international forums, including in recent meetings of the European Parliament and the Joint Assembly of the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, in a clear attempt to justify the terrorist acts in question. 18 My Government, however, faithful to its commitment to establish a State based on the rule of law in Equatorial Guinea, held a public trial, with procedural guarantees and international observers. Furthermore, the 15 death sentences imposed on the main perpetrators of those crimes have been commuted by the President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, Mr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, in an effort to preserve the social unity of the nation. But it seems that such measures still do not satisfy the political circles that are persisting in their attempts to destabilize the peaceful people of Equatorial Guinea. Nevertheless, I would like to assure the Assembly that, thanks to the maturity of the people of Equatorial Guinea and because of their peaceful spirit and openness to dialogue and democratic debate, we have been free from the serious upheavals experienced by some countries and regions of our continent as a result of such actions. The internal realities of Equatorial Guinea therefore bear no relation to the systematic campaign of hounding and harassment that has been waged against it for several years. Peace and stability prevail, investments are flowing in and there are real signs of growth. The political reforms are irreversible, our State of law is being strengthened and the better governance of the country is being promoted. To that end, the Government of Equatorial Guinea has relations of cooperation with several international organizations and friendly countries for the establishment of technical assistance programmes in the fields of economics, democracy, human rights and governance. We are continuing to cooperate with the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and our cooperation with the international financial institutions is positive in the areas to which I have referred. We are clearly living during a time of promise and rebirth in our country. We appeal here to the international community to show its solidarity by supporting our efforts to consolidate the democratic process and the implementation of the plan for the socio-economic development of the country, outlined by the national economic conference, which took place in Bata from 8 to 14 September 1997. With regard to the African continent, we urge the international community to find mechanisms geared to achieving a ceasefire and ending the hostilities in the Great Lakes region and to restoring peace and order in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Eritrea and Ethiopia. To that end, we wish to reaffirm here the recommendations contained in the Bata declaration for the promotion of democracy, peace and sustainable development in Africa, which was adopted by the subregional conference on democratic institutions and peace in Central Africa, held from 18 to 21 May 1998 under the auspices of the United Nations, at which the President of Equatorial Guinea recommended the creation of a subregional parliament to deal with issues so as to guarantee peace and security in the subregion. Equatorial Guinea pledges to make its contribution to the attainment of that objective. Finally, my country reaffirms its support for the necessary reform of the Security Council. With regard to the increase of its membership, we are in favour of equitable distribution so that our Organization will be able faithfully to reflect the geopolitical realities of today’s world. In this context, Equatorial Guinea associates itself with the position, adopted at the twelfth summit of the non-aligned countries held a month ago in Durban, South Africa, that Africa should have two permanent seats and five non-permanent seats, in the interests of the credibility and democratization of the United Nations.  First of all, I should like to extend my warmest congratulations to Mr. Didier Opertti on his well- deserved election to the presidency of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. His recognized skills as a veteran diplomat and his extensive knowledge of international affairs augur well for the success of our deliberations. As we assure him of our complete cooperation, my delegation would like to wish him every possible success. I should like also to avail myself of this opportunity to pay tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of our Organization, for the crucial role that he has played in the preservation of peace and the promotion of socio-economic development throughout the world. We are extremely grateful to him for the laudable efforts he has made in the first two difficult years of his term. In the past year, the world situation has continued to undergo changes that are more profound and complex than in the preceding years. World peace continues to be just as fragile. In various regions of the world, civil wars, conflicts among States, border disputes and ethnic, tribal and religious confrontations continue to take place. Some of these events offer no glimmer of abatement, while others have been deliberately provoked against the sovereignty of other States. In the face of this situation, it is important for the international community, in its respect for the Charter of the United Nations, to focus its energies and do its utmost to reduce tensions and assist the countries concerned in resolving their problems by means of negotiations, thus favouring the current general trend towards international cooperation for development. On the eve of the third millennium, States and peoples throughout the world should together endeavour to lay the appropriate solid foundations to construct a new era of relations based on peace, social justice and equality. In certain regions of Europe, there has been a resurgence of deadly ethnic conflicts, resulting in enormous losses in human lives and material property. While coming out in favour of the inviolability of internationally recognized borders, we should like sincerely to appeal to the countries involved to show restraint and resolve their conflicts through dialogue. In Africa, we are still witnessing ethnic confrontation, civil war and border conflicts that continue gravely to threaten peace, stability and cooperation. In view of the great suffering that the victimized peoples of certain countries of the region must ensure, the international community must render its support and assistance to the countries concerned in their efforts to resolve their problems by peaceful means and as soon as possible. In the Caribbean, an atmosphere of peace and cooperation continues to prevail. In this context, we profoundly regret that the 30-year-plus economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed on the Republic of Cuba by the United States of America has not yet been lifted. In the interest of regional and world peace as well as in the interest of both the Cuban and American people, it is our hope that the two countries concerned will commit themselves to reasonable negotiations so as to resolve their dispute as soon as possible in conformity with the general trend obtaining throughout the world. In the Middle East, the situation appears tense. The peace process begun following the signature by the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel of the 13 Washington Accords of 1993 has run up against grave difficulties in the past two years in the wake of the establishments of new settlements in Har Homa in East Jerusalem and of other unilateral measures that have been taken. In our view, it is imperative for the parties involved immediately to put an end to unilateral measures and speedily to restore a climate of mutual trust and continue seriously in their negotiations to achieve a general settlement based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and other relevant General Assembly resolutions in order to contribute to the restoration of peace, security and cooperation in this very delicate region of the world. On the Korean peninsula in general we are witnessing a reduction in tension. Contacts and talks among the parties concerned are continuing in a spirit of respect for mutual interests. While welcoming the efforts deployed, the Government and people of the Lao Peopleâs Democratic Republic would like to reiterate their sincere support for the profound aspirations of the Korean people to live in peace and to achieve the peaceful reunification of their cherished homeland. In South-East Asia multifaceted beneficial cooperation among States is continuing under good conditions. Nevertheless, in the wake of the financial crisis that occurred more than a year ago, the countries of the region are now going through unprecedented grave economic difficulties. But thanks mainly to national efforts and regional and international cooperation, these countries are, through adjustment programmes, engaged in a process of profound economic restructuring in order to get back on track. The international community as a whole has been called upon to support them actively, particularly those most affected. Another important event that has characterized our region was the holding last July of general elections in Cambodia, the results of which have been recognized and approved by the international community. As a nearby neighbour, the Lao Peopleâs Democratic Republic would like to express the hope that the Cambodian parties concerned will speedily form a coalition Government which, in accordance with the Constitution, will be headed by a prime minister from the party that has been elected by majority which would contribute to the establishment of national concord in Cambodia and the promotion of peace and stability in the region. In the Lao Peopleâs Democratic Republic, socio- political stability continues to be securely guaranteed. In accordance with the Constitution, national legislative elections took place on 21 December 1997. The new National Assembly â€” the Fourth Legislature â€” has been set up and is made up of 99 members, including 21 women, representing the three major ethnic groups of the country. In the economic sphere, the implementation of a recovery policy based on market mechanisms has produced generally satisfactory results. However, the monetary crisis that has severely afflicted all of South- East Asia and even beyond for more than a year has considerably affected our economy. But, resolutely basing policies on the principle of self-reliance and enjoying external cooperation, the Lao Government has mobilized all of its capacity in human, intellectual, natural and material resources to reduce to the minimum the adverse effects of this crisis on our society and to achieve normalization. While some can gain in this era of globalization and economic liberalization, the fact is that most developing countries, particularly the least developed, have been largely marginalized and exposed to enormous difficulties and risks. In this context, the developed countries must do everything possible to render the necessary assistance to these countries so that they might catch up in their lagging development and have a share in the progress of the times. Drug abuse continues to figure prominently on the international agenda. In this connection, the Government of the Lao Peopleâs Democratic Republic has taken the necessary measures with a view to reducing production and banning the illicit trafficking in drugs, opium in particular. The results of these measures are satisfactory. However, the illegal introduction of synthetic drugs from abroad is still our main concern. In this connection, we welcome the unanimous adoption by the General Assembly at its twentieth special session of the Political Declaration and a programme of action, and we express the hope that the international community as a whole will mobilize itself and marshall the necessary financial resources to implement this ambitious programme. The question of human rights is no less important in my country. Thus, on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, my Government has officially announced the establishment of a national committee to commemorate this day solemnly on a wide scale with the sole purpose of publicizing the contents of the Declaration among the 14 multi-ethnic Lao people and to promote harmony and mutual respect in our society. The world today is confronted with numerous challenges. World peace remains fragile. Under- development, poverty, hunger and disease are among the priority problems that must be resolved. With the purpose of consolidating peace and achieving development throughout the world, the United Nations, our only universal multilateral forum, must make an important contribution. To be able to fulfil its mission in this new era, our Organization needs to restructure itself or to reorganize itself to be more effective. In this connection, we would like to express our great appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the reform initiatives he presented last year. Of course, these reforms which must, inter alia, stress the strengthening the role of the Organization and the promotion of development, represent an ongoing and difficult process. But in order for them to succeed, a solid financial basis must be assured. In that vein, it is high time that, in conformity with the United Nations Charter, all the Member States, particularly the main contributors, fulfil their financial commitments in full and on time. In so doing, we are giving the incipient reforms a chance, and in the final analysis we would be infusing energy into our Organization so that it could discharge its lofty mission as it confronts the challenges of our times.   I should like to extend my most sincere compliments to you, Sir, Foreign Minister of Uruguay, on your assumption of office as President of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. I should also like to express my respects to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, Deputy of the Supreme Rada of Ukraine, for all his efforts during his tenure as President of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly. How should we build the framework for a new international order in the twenty-first century? This is the question that our international community is facing amidst new situations that were created in the aftermath of the collapse of the cold war, almost a decade ago. That collapse provided an opportunity to establish a harmonious order based upon the cooperation of the entire international community, rather than the maintenance of peace by a military balance between two super-Powers. However, our international community today is troubled with frequent regional conflicts and challenged by the inseparably connected problem of poverty. Creating a new system to cope effectively with such challenges is the greatest agenda for our international community today. To achieve this objective, we must simultaneously promote three issues: peace and development, which are two sides of the same coin, plus United Nations reforms, which are indispensable in our efforts to achieve the first two. Today, the possibility of a world-wide conflict has decreased in comparison to the cold-war era, but conflicts arising from such causes as ethnic and religious confrontation are increasing. In dealing with these conflicts, it is more important to focus on how to prevent them rather than on how to solve them once they break out. In this regard, we must first consider the essential issues of arms control and disarmament. The recent nuclear tests of India and Pakistan constitute enormous challenges to the non-proliferation regime. We urgently need to find a way to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and to strengthen the non-proliferation regime. Furthermore, it is necessary to deal not only with the weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, but also with such conventional weapons as small arms and anti-personnel landmines. Social instabilities lie at the root of conflicts. This makes it extremely important to deal with development issues. There are also growing global threats, such as environmental destruction and terrorism. The cruel destructive power of terrorism especially threatens the lives and safety of citizens. It is different by nature from conventional armed conflict between nations, but in the post-cold-war world it poses increasingly grave concerns to our security. Our international community should seriously consider ways to effectively cope with these problems and threats. Today, based on such thinking, I should like to discuss these issues from the perspectives of peace and development and of reform, which is indispensable in promoting the first two. In so doing, I want to elaborate on our thinking and express our determination to play a leading role in fulfilling our responsibilities. I should first like to talk about nuclear non- proliferation, arms control and disarmament, which are essential to maintaining peace. In May this year, India and Pakistan conducted, to our deepest regret, a series of nuclear tests, which are formidable challenges to the nuclear non-proliferation regime. In seeking a world free of nuclear weapons, it is indispensable that we allow no further proliferation and secure a solid basis for the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The existing format certainly is not perfect, but there is no feasible, realistic alternative if we are to ensure stability in our international community. No country should be allowed to attempt to set back international efforts towards strengthening the non-proliferation regime. At the same time, to improve the effectiveness of this regime, it is important, together with the efforts by all nations to maintain non- proliferation, to see sincere implementation of nuclear 16 disarmament by nuclear-weapon States. Based on this thinking, we regard the following five points as important. First, the nuclear non-proliferation regime should become more universal. The Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) sets the structure for international control of nuclear weapons, with no alternative, and we strongly urge non-parties to accede to this Treaty promptly and without condition. In this context, we highly appreciate Brazilâs accession to the NPT in August this year. Secondly, in order to complement the NPT and ensure nuclear non-proliferation, I should like to underline the need to place strict export controls on equipment, materials and technologies that relate to nuclear weapons and missiles. We urge every nation to engage in serious efforts to prevent any transfer of such materials and technologies. Thirdly, we must prevent any further nuclear testing. Without universal support for the Comprehensive Nuclear- Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), the effectiveness of the nuclear non-proliferation system cannot be maintained. I should like to call on nations that have not yet done so to promptly become parties to this Treaty so as to realize its early effectuation. In the meantime, we should take necessary steps to assure the cessation of nuclear testing. Fourthly, further advancement of nuclear disarmament by nuclear-weapon States is more important than ever in maintaining and strengthening various efforts for nuclear non-proliferation. We hope to see early effectuation of START II and an early launching of negotiations on START III. Also, we welcome such actions as the decision by the British Government in July this year for a significant reduction of their nuclear arsenals, as well as Franceâs decision to dismantle its ground-to-ground missiles. We urge all the nuclear-weapon States to implement sincerely their obligations under article 6 of the NPT, thereby promoting nuclear disarmament even further. Fifthly, to put a cap on nuclear-weapons capability, each nation must positively participate in and reach an early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty. During this session of the General Assembly, Japan will take initiatives to promote these five objectives. Needless to say, the promotion of arms control and disarmament should not be limited to the area of nuclear weapons. Dealing with other weapons of mass destruction, such as biological and chemical weapons, as well as delivery vehicles, such as missiles, is of high importance. The recent missile launch by North Korea, even if it was an attempt to launch a satellite into orbit, poses a serious problem which directly concerns both Japanâs national security and peace and stability in North-East Asia. It also constitutes a challenge to our efforts to prevent the proliferation of delivery vehicles of weapons of mass destruction. I renew my call for North Korea to consider seriously the 15 September statement by the President of the Security Council as a message reflecting the views of the entire international community, and to never repeat such an act. Furthermore, to prevent the outbreak and escalation of conflicts, we also need to address the problems of anti- personnel landmines and small arms, including automatic rifles, regarding which we have yet to make sufficient efforts. We intend to continue to play a leading role on these issues. In particular, in the area of anti-personnel landmines we will endeavour to strengthen international cooperation towards early realization of the â€œzero victimâ€ objective, by supporting assistance for victims and the elimination of landmines. We are pleased that 40 countries have now ratified the Convention banning anti- personnel landmines and that it will enter into force on 1 March next year. We are now making efforts for Japanâs earliest possible ratification of this Convention. We ask other nations yet to ratify it to do so promptly, so that it may become a universal framework to ban anti-personnel landmines totally. Conflicts give rise to intolerable crimes against humanity, such as genocide. To deter such crimes, it is necessary to establish a permanent international court that punishes such acts as international crimes. Adoption of the agreement in July this year in Rome to establish such a court was an act of historic significance. Japan believes that the blessing and cooperation of the entire international community is indispensable if the court is to produce effective results. That is why we took important initiatives at the Diplomatic Conference. It is our hope that the International Criminal Court will continue to grow and become a universal framework. In our efforts towards peace, with civilian staff assuming an increasing role in United Nations activities, including peacekeeping, we observe with regret an increasing number of cases where non-combatants become the targets of violence by belligerents. In July this year, a staff member from Japan, together with staff members from Poland, Tajikistan and Uruguay, fell victim to a 17 despicable criminal act directed at the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan. The countries concerned and the United Nations need to seriously examine ways to ensure the security of United Nations personnel and of relevant humanitarian-assistance organizations. In this regard, we reiterate our call upon nations that have not yet done so to join the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, adopted in December 1994, so that it may come into force as soon as possible. At the same time, Japan will also make contributions of about $1 million to the United Nations to support security measures for United Nations personnel. We hope many other countries will also make contributions to support United Nations efforts in this field. Some of the basic causes of conflicts are problems of economic and social development. We must pay close attention to them. During the Tokyo International Conference on Preventive Strategy, which Japan hosted this January, participants underlined the importance of a comprehensive approach in dealing with such problems by coming to grips with various causes of them, including poverty. The development issue is the greatest challenge the world will face in the twenty-first century. In addressing this issue, we have to deal not only with the economic- development problems of the developing countries, but also with the social sides of development, such as human rights and good governance. Japan has been advocating a new development strategy that contains such ideas. We are pleased that the concept was endorsed in 1996 at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and has been gaining support in the United Nations. This strategy is based on the philosophy that the international community should make no distinction between donor countries and recipient countries and should tackle the problems of development as a common issue for all. In this regard, this strategy attaches great importance to developing countriesâ playing an active and responsible role in their own development. It also emphasizes positive cooperation based on partnership without distinction between developing and developed countries. These are the guiding principles of the new development strategy. On the basis of these principles, the Second Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD II) will be held in Japan this October as a follow- up to the first Conference, held in 1993. Its objective is to seek a path to promote the new development strategy in Africa so as to support African countriesâ own nation- building efforts. In this regard, we aim to draw up an agenda for action. Japan also has been making the greatest contributions possible to the stable development of Asia. In the present financial and economic crisis we have taken initiatives to implement measures of support totalling about $43 billion to Asian countries, which is the largest single contribution by any nation in the world. Simultaneously, Japan is making every possible effort, through such measures as stabilizing our financial system, to put our own economy on a recovery track within the next year or two. We believe that the early recovery of our own economy is the best contribution we can make to the economies of Asia and of the world. We hope strongly that the coming conference, TICAD II, will benefit from such Asian experiences and provide a good opportunity to use the wisdom and power of the entire international community to assist the development of the African continent. In the post-cold-war transformation of international relations, Japan is actively promoting what we call Eurasian diplomacy. This means redefining relations with countries of the Eurasian continent, including the Russian Federation, the Peopleâs Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and countries in the Silk Road regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus range. This is another example of Japanâs policy of promoting peace and development in tandem. In todayâs world, problems that directly threaten peopleâs daily lives across national borders are becoming increasingly serious. These include environmental destruction, overpopulation, human rights violations, the exodus of refugees, terrorism, drug-trafficking, international organized crime and global diseases such as AIDS. To cope with these problems, our international community must be united under the concept of protecting the security and dignity of mankind from global threats. Furthermore, citizens, along with Governments, must get together to engage in common undertakings, such as making common rules. In particular, as we mark the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, I should like to point out that efforts against large-scale human rights violations and efforts to ease refugee problems arising from conflicts are also indispensable for preventing conflicts. 18 In addressing issues of peace and development, there is an urgent need to reform the United Nations and to strengthen its functions. Peace and development are two sides of the same coin. At the same time, if the United Nations is to respond effectively to various problems that our international community shoulders, we urgently need to do our best to assure a healthy financial basis. This includes each Member Stateâs sincere implementation of its obligation to pay its assessed contribution. Japanâs assessment will be over 20 per cent, exceeding the sum of that of four permanent members of the Security Council, not including the United States. In this situation, reform in the financial area requires serious attention. In reforming the United Nations to strengthen its functioning, we must promote reforms in three interrelated areas in a balanced manner: reform in the political area, the development area, and the financial area, which supports political and development activities. It is regrettable that even though the chances of materializing reforms increased during last yearâs General Assembly session, discussions on the reform of the Security Council have not developed since then. Under the circumstances facing the international community I mentioned earlier, reforming the Security Council to reinforce its legitimacy and effectiveness is an urgent task. Japan, with the endorsement of many countries, is prepared to assume greater responsibilities as a permanent member of the Security Council. This would be in accordance with our basic philosophy of non-resort to the use of force prohibited by our Constitution. We are now in the fifth year since the concrete discussions on the reform of the Security Council started. Points of argument have been exhausted. We are now at a stage where each country should make a political decision. Japan believes that we are able to agree on a package that responds to the interests of the entire international community and to the legitimate concerns of the majority of countries. If we do not have the will to decide and act in order to achieve an agreement on such a package, we will not be able to respond effectively to challenges the international community will face in the coming century. Japan strongly urges all countries to make a bold political decision for the strengthening of the United Nations so that we may reach an agreement on the framework of the reform during the present session of the General Assembly. The twenty-first century is just around the corner. It is our duty to preserve and develop the heritage of mankind in the coming century. The late professor, Mr. Yutaka Akino, who gave his life during his mission of peacekeeping in Tajikistan, was one of my close friends. He had the following motto: do not be pushed around by events; take action. Along the same lines, the United Nations should make action a top priority and become a strong Organization equipped with both effectiveness and credibility, squarely tackling all problems. We the Member States should make utmost efforts to achieve it, so that the United Nations can enter the twenty-first century as such an Organization. The future of the United Nations is in the hands of the Member States. My guiding principle in Japanâs policy management is to be sincere, to be steady and to be courageously prompt. I therefore should like to conclude my remarks by emphasizing my resolution to take leadership in addressing issues of peace, development and reform in a sincere, steady and courageously prompt manner. On behalf of the people and the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu, I wish to join previous speakers in congratulating Mr. Didier Opertti on his election to this high and important post. His unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session shows the esteem in which the international community holds both him personally and his country, Uruguay. The Republic of Vanuatu and its delegation are confident he will guide this fifty-third session of the General Assembly to a successful conclusion. May I also take this opportunity to express my delegation?s sincere appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his outstanding stewardship in facilitating the work of the fifty-second session of the 24 General Assembly. I also wish to commend our Secretary- General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his wise leadership and his dedication to the reform and restructuring of our Organization. We ask the President to assure him of our total support. Three years ago, we all gathered here to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization and, in particular, to renew our commitment to the fundamental principles that created it in 1945. We also made a strong commitment to further strengthen our genuine, collaborative efforts to ensure that this Organization continues to promote global peace, justice and a healthy environment, as well as to support the process of sustainable development of its Member nations, in particular the small island least developed countries such as those in the Pacific region, including the Republic of Vanuatu. The current international political and economic situation has grown ever more complex and makes increasing demands on our own resources and on the support available from our development partners. We are deeply concerned by the continuing escalation of such international crimes as drug-trafficking, money- laundering, terrorism, organized crime and other similar activities which have the potential to place the sovereignty and territorial integrity of small island States at great risk. The international community must show its genuine collaboration in combating these criminal phenomena if the new philosophy of globalization is to progress in a positive manner. We do not believe that the world is doing justice to its people and to the fundamental principles of peace and economic prosperity as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations if we do not observe our joint call for the disarmament of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. International security cannot be guaranteed if we fail to accord priority attention and resources to the education and health of humankind and its survival into the next millennium. The momentum of the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization, the lessons we have learned from past mistakes and our renewed commitment must guide us in our pursuit of a better world where, through this Organization, a renewed sense of mutual trust and genuine dialogue can be achieved to ease political tensions and economic crises in all regions and subregions of the planet. In our part of the world, these new developments constitute a real threat to the already vulnerable environment of our island economies and populations. Confronted with these challenges, many countries in the Pacific region, including the Republic of Vanuatu, do not have much choice, at the end of this century, but to embark on difficult programmes of reform both within their respective Governments and within their societies. Last year, my predecessor, The Honourable Serge Vohor, advised this Assembly that Vanuatu had initiated a comprehensive reform programme, with the support of both multilateral and bilateral donor agencies and countries. He also made an appeal to this Assembly, explaining that in order for the reform programme to be successful and responsive to the needs of the national population, 80 per cent of whom live from subsistence farming in rural areas, Vanuatu would continue to need the special support accorded to it as a least developed country. The role of Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko and the Secretary-General in subsequently facilitating a constructive dialogue and a comprehensive appreciation of the economic hardships of Vanuatu must be commended. In this regard, the Government and the people of Vanuatu warmly welcome the recent decision of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations to defer consideration of Vanuatu?s graduation from least developed country status, pending full assessment of the usefulness of the vulnerability index and ecological fragility as criteria for least developed country designation. We would like to register our most sincere appreciation and recognition to each and every country and group of countries for their support. One of the commitments we all made during the fiftieth anniversary celebrations in 1995 was to reform our Organization so that it could be effective in addressing the problems and needs of its Member States, both individually and as a group. From our perspective — and we have no doubt that others share it — the United Nations must include in its reform agenda a full assessment and recognition of the inherent particularities of small island States such as the Republic of Vanuatu, and the impact of the international economic crisis on their economic performance and the sustainability of their political stability. 25 The impact of the Asian economic situation and such recurrent national disasters as tropical cyclones, tidal waves and global warming on our island economies has yet to be fully appraised. This warrants the urgent and dedicated attention of our Organization. With particular regard to the environment, the first chapter of the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States clearly states that small island States are particularly vulnerable to global climate change and rising sea levels. We would therefore like to suggest, in the spirit of reform, that the current scope of development-related indicators being used by the United Nations to designate the status of each Member State be thoroughly reviewed in close consultation with the Member States and other regional and multilateral organizations, such as the South Pacific Forum and the Commonwealth. This is an important exercise at a time when we must adjust our national administrative structures, policy directives and legal framework to gradually accommodate the requirements of globalization. It would be unfair and unrealistic to expect small island least developed countries to satisfy all the administrative, financial and legal requirements of the World Trade Organization, for instance, within the same time-frame as the developed countries. An effective sequencing of the accession process is needed, taking into account the capacity of each country?s political and economic system or structure to adjust without affecting social cohesion. The Republic of Vanuatu is committed to the principle of global trade liberalization. The current reform programme reflects this. We are asking the international community to recognize that we should be allowed to be integrated on a gradual basis, taking into account our capacity to administer the process and to adjust to the new environment. It is in this same spirit that the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu welcomes the decision of the fifty- second session of the General Assembly to convene the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries in the year 2001. It is still in this spirit that the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu endorses the Declaration of the eighth annual meeting of ministers from least developed countries, adopted on 28 September 1998. The Republic of Vanuatu is proud to be associated this year with the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the fifth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. I am pleased to advise this Assembly that the current reform programme of the Republic of Vanuatu has taken full account of the above principles and the Government?s commitment in this regard. An example of this commitment is our wider recognition of the rights and the role of women in our society through the establishment, within the Prime Minister?s portfolio, of a more systematic mechanism of constructive dialogue between the Government on the one hand, and the National Council of Women and other non- governmental organizations on the other hand. The recent enactment of a first ever leadership code for Vanuatu is another example in this regard. This will not only ensure good governance, transparency and the rule of law, but will also act as an effective deterrent to corruption and abuse of power by national leaders in political circles, in public service and in the religious community, as well as in traditional society. The pursuit and promotion of a free and responsible press and the protection of individual rights are matters which are receiving more attention under the reform programme. These are real challenges to Vanuatu today, but they are challenges which we are confident that we can successfully address over time with the necessary support of the international community. The right to self-determination must also continue to occupy our agenda. The United Nations, as mandated by its Charter, must be seen to encourage and support dialogue at appropriate political levels in the regions and countries where human sufferings and social disorder continue as a direct result of conflict of opinions on the issue of self-determination. In the Pacific region, we warmly welcomed the signing earlier this year of the Noumea Accord between the French Government and the major political parties in New Caledonia. We believe that this new agreement marks a stronger commitment by all parties to work together to support an irreversible trend for the future political status of New Caledonia. As I said earlier, the world and our Organization will be going through very challenging times as we are set to turn the page of this century and start a new one. The credibility of the United Nations in the next millennium will be measured in terms of its effectiveness in 26 responding to the real situations prevailing in its Member States, especially in small island States. It is therefore vital that we all support and supplement the process of reform spearheaded by the Secretary-General and aimed at streamlining and strengthening the Organization. At the outset, allow me to join the previous speakers in congratulating Mr. Opertti most sincerely, on his election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. His election is indeed a recognition of his excellent qualities as an experienced and seasoned diplomat committed to the ideals of peace. As I congratulate him today, I am reminded of the excellent role played by Uruguay in assisting Mozambique to consolidate peace and stability. On behalf of my Government, and on my own behalf, I wish to seize this opportunity to express our heartfelt tribute to those young men who lost their lives in the search for peace in my country. Let me also pay well-deserved tribute for the excellent manner in which his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, discharged his duties as President of the General Assembly at its last session. I also wish to commend the Secretary-General for his continued devotion to peace and development worldwide. His recent initiatives in this regard deserve my Government?s full support, and we look forward to continuing to work closely with him. In my last address to this body, one year ago, I spoke of positive changes which had taken place in my country. I am pleased to reconfirm today that the people of Mozambique remain firm in their determination to undertake bold steps aimed at ensuring and further strengthening democracy, good governance and the rule of law. Within this context, the first municipal elections were held in June this year, thus consolidating the process initiated with the holding of the general elections four years ago. Preparations are currently under way for the forthcoming general elections, scheduled for 1999. The implementation of structural and economic reforms under the most severe circumstances over the last 11 years should be seen within this perspective. Mozambique is emerging step by step from the scourges of war and is gradually proving that, with hard work and 31 adequate international assistance, the country can and will be a valuable partner in the international market place. We believe that by concentrating on economic fundamentals — including low inflation rates, a stable currency and a transparent exchange-rate policy, stimulating private-sector growth and increasing foreign and domestic investment flows — our economy can achieve the desired results. These measures have enabled Mozambique to achieve a growth of 14 per cent in its gross domestic product last year, compared to a real average growth of about 6.6 per cent from 1991 to 1996. In addition, increased agricultural production, coupled with the privatization of over 900 Government-owned companies and the rehabilitation and restructuring of the main elements of infrastructure — such as roads, ports and railways — have significantly contributed to raising productivity and have played a critical role in achieving these encouraging economic results. The report of the Secretary-General on assistance to Mozambique, which I highly commend, provides a further account of the state of the Mozambican economy today. Moreover, the Governments of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region, in close cooperation with the private sector, are taking aggressive steps towards regional integration. These include, inter alia, the launching of mega-projects, such as the Maputo Development Corridor, a joint initiative by the Governments of Mozambique and of South Africa; the $1.3 billion MOZAL aluminum smelter, recently announced by the London Metals Exchange, a multi-partnership investment; and the Libombo Spatial Development Initiative, involving Mozambique, Swaziland and South Africa. Notwithstanding these positive developments, we are still faced with acute problems whose solution is vital if the country is to maintain the needed stability. The most critical of these, without a doubt, is the debt burden, which continues to be the single most significant impediment to national development. My Government welcomes the decision taken in April this year by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with regard to the eligibility of Mozambique to debt relief within the framework of Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative. We regard this Initiative as a recognition by the international community of my Government?s continued commitment to undertake sound political and economic reforms, and also of the suffering endured by our people throughout these years of the implementation of such measures. While representing a significant step in the right direction, the Initiative in its present form is not yet a definite solution to the debt problem. Further assistance by the international community, and the creditor community in particular, is required. We need to ensure the irreversibility of the positive developments, especially taking into account that even with current relief measures, poor countries, particularly the least developed countries, remain poor. We would therefore encourage the creditor and donor communities to continue to review and consider new relief measures, including the cancellation of official bilateral debt, in order to ensure that the affected countries can redirect their meagre resources to social programmes. As a matter of fact, the eleventh meeting of the Consultative Group for Mozambique is taking place tomorrow in Maputo. The holding of this meeting on Mozambican soil for the first time symbolizes the growing relationship between Mozambique and its partners, and my Government will do its utmost to ensure a successful outcome of the proceedings with the creditor community. Moreover, we are still confronted with the issue of the prevailing threat of anti-personnel landmines, which continue to disrupt the very existence of nations and peoples. For this reason, my Government has signed and ratified the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. We did so as a recognition of the imperative need to find durable solutions to this issue. We warmly welcome the fortieth ratification, by Burkina Faso, which will enable the Convention to enter into force, and we hope other countries will do the same as soon as possible. In this regard, my Government offered to host in Maputo next year the first meeting of States parties to the Ottawa Convention, in accordance with article 11 of the Convention. It is our hope that the meeting will result in the adoption of meaningful recommendations to address in a comprehensive manner the issue of anti-personnel landmines, particularly international cooperation and assistance and other relevant issues envisaged by this important instrument of international humanitarian law. We are eager to welcome all of you to Maputo. 32 Let me take this opportunity to express my Government?s deep gratitude and appreciation to the pioneering role of Canada on this issue. It is my hope that all interested parties will take an active part in the deliberations within the framework of the draft resolution to be presented in the First Committee. Last April, the Secretary-General presented his report to the Security Council on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa. We wish to commend him for his vision in preparing that report. The Secretary-General?s report represents a valuable contribution for a better understanding of African problems and offers concrete recommendations for durable solutions by the international community. All efforts should be deployed to ensure that that report does not follow the negative examples of other similarly important reports prepared by the United Nations before. I am particularly thankful for the recommendation that economic sanctions should be better targeted in order to prevent the unnecessary suffering of innocent people, as we have been witnessing over the years. The concept of peace-friendly structural adjustment programmes should be fully implemented in order to minimize the negative consequences of such programmes for the well-being of peoples. As outlined in these recommendations: conditionalities should not be antithetical to peace processes; donors should not cut off funds from weak governments which, in good faith, are making popularly supported efforts to implement peace agreements; aid should be focused on high-impact areas to reduce dependence; donors should strive to ensure that at least 50 per cent of their aid to Africa is spent in Africa; and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative should be expanded to benefit more African countries. These recommendations deserve our full support, and what is now required of us is to find the best ways and means of putting them into practice. I would also agree with the Secretary-General when he stresses that, without political will, Africa will remain behind, with nothing to offer to future generations. For these reasons, I wish to endorse the proposed holding of Security Council meetings at ministerial level on a biennial basis to assess efforts undertaken and actions needed in this regard. Moreover, the convening of the Security Council at summit level within five years to discuss the situation in Africa could not be more timely. Indeed, it is high time for the Council to devote the necessary attention to African problems if the international community is to ensure a better future for the African continent. Today as yesterday, globalization is a matter of fact. However, we cannot afford to leave vast segments of nations and peoples unattended and still confronting basic challenges such as famine, epidemic diseases and inadequate water distribution, among other challenges. As an African, I am certain that Africa is prepared to shoulder its responsibilities in this regard, so that together we will be able to work towards a common goal. The crisis which initially begun as an isolated case in the Asian economies has rapidly spread to virtually all continents. Its consequences have demonstrated that no country in this globalized economy is immune to the suffering of other nations. Adequate solutions lie in sustainable development based on partnership in development cooperation. The persistence of extreme poverty in developing countries, particularly in the least developed ones, will continue to represent a threat to the economies of developed countries. The new vision which appears to emerge from the Bretton Woods institutions, bringing together the United Nations and other partners in the solution of social problems, will contribute to addressing major challenges facing our countries today. I would like to take this opportunity to praise the two-day high-level meetings of the General Assembly held a few days ago on renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international cooperation for development through partnership and on the social and economic impact of globalization and interdependence and their policy implications. The meetings demonstrated the need to bring together governments, the private sector and other relevant segments of civil society in the search for solutions to global problems. We therefore hope that the ongoing reform of the United Nations will open new windows for the Organization to strengthen its role and functions in the promotion of international cooperation for the social and economic development of developing countries. As has been emphasized, the United Nations, by virtue of its universal membership, is the most credible instrument for performing development tasks. Regional conflicts continue to be a major concern on the agenda of the United Nations. Despite the recent signing of understandings at Victoria Falls, the hostilities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continue unabated. We are deeply concerned by the course of 33 events, which threatens not only the territorial integrity of that country but also peace and stability in the Great Lakes region as a whole. We believe that with good will there can be a solution addressing the concerns of all parties involved in this conflict. Neither Africa nor the international community can afford to add a new chapter of conflicts of regional proportions, especially taking into account that virtually all other long-standing conflicts in that continent continue to defy our collective imagination. With respect to Angola, we are equally concerned with continued procrastination by Mr. Savimbi in the implementation of undertakings within the framework of the Lusaka Protocol and of relevant Security Council resolutions. It is, indeed, the failure of União Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola (UNITA) to live up to its obligations which is leading the peace process in Angola to the brink of collapse. Both the international community and the parties concerned have an obligation to rescue the suffering people of Angola from the prospect of yet another conflict of major proportions. The attainment of peace in Angola would undoubtedly contribute to bringing about needed stability in the region. We are fully associated with the progress made by the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries and by the Economic Community of West African States in the search for the peace which has eluded Guinea-Bissau since the outbreak of hostilities in that country. These positive developments underline the importance of political will by the parties concerned, which should prevail in conflict situations. My Government is also encouraged by the developments concerning Western Sahara, and looks forward to the holding of the referendum in that Territory. It is our hope that wisdom and statesmanship will prevail, and that peace and stability will ultimately become a reality in Somalia, the Horn of Africa, the Sudan and other troubled regions of the African continent and beyond. We are encouraged by the recent developments concerning East Timor, as illustrated by the outcome of the most recent meeting, held in New York, between the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia and of Portugal under the auspices of the Secretary-General. We wish to encourage them to pursue further these efforts with a view to finding a lasting and internationally acceptable solution to this issue. My Government has been following with keen interest the latest developments in the Middle East. We have good reason to be disappointed by the course of events since the last session of the General Assembly. Without a comprehensive and just solution to the question of Palestine, which is the core of the conflict in the Middle East, as well as respect for the legitimate interests of all peoples of the region, the prospects for a lasting peace remain in danger. In addition, the latest developments concerning nuclear proliferation in South Asia have added new elements of destabilization to the already volatile international security environment. The new arms race in that region constitutes a major setback in the international efforts aimed at ensuring peace, security and stability in that region and in the world at large. Rather than providing security guarantees for the countries concerned, the new reality has in fact exacerbated the tensions in the region. This session of the General Assembly takes place at an auspicious time for all the peoples of the world: 1998 will be recorded as the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Through concrete actions the international community must honour those who have lost their lives in defence of human dignity during the 50 years of the existence of the Universal Declaration. Through concrete actions we must ensure that the horrors and uncertainties of the past and the continued violations of fundamental human rights are not repeated in the new millennium. We must devise appropriate strategies and find ways and means which will enable future generations to live in harmony, peace and development, and which will prevent the recurrence of the abuses of human dignity that have been witnessed throughout human history. It is only through such actions that we can ensure that the motto of “all human rights for all” is fully realized. As the Secretary-General once reminded us, human rights belong to no Government and are limited to no continent, for they are fundamental to humankind itself. We in Mozambique look forward to the celebrations as a source of momentum in educating ourselves about the scope and magnitude of human rights and fundamental freedoms, taking into account that the promotion and protection of these rights is essentially everyone?s responsibility. However, we recognize the primary responsibility of the State in ensuring the enjoyment of human rights by our citizens. My Government underscores the need to assert the integrated, interdependent and indivisible nature of all categories of rights, in which both political and civil rights, and 34 economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development, are treated equally. The programme we have prepared, which will culminate in a major celebration on 10 December, is in conformity with these principles. The establishment in Rome last July of the International Criminal Court represents a remarkable contribution by mankind to the protection and promotion of human rights all over the world. In Rome we created an unprecedented comprehensive legal framework to safeguard human rights and bring to justice those responsible for the most heinous crimes ever witnessed by humanity, such as those committed in the recent cases of Rwanda and of the former Yugoslavia. Although we would have liked a Court with more far-reaching powers, we understand that the present statute adopted in Rome represents a very delicate and difficult compromise achieved through very long and painful negotiations. Efforts must be made to make possible the early entry into force of the statute of the Court. We must also explore all possible avenues offered by the statute to improve the functioning and competence of the Court. That course of action would undoubtedly provide better acceptance of the statute of the Court and would ultimately ensure its universality. Our success in tackling the human rights issue, sustainable development and conflict resolution as well as in finding consensus on the major issues within the framework of the ongoing process of reform of our Organization will greatly depend on the manner in which we can accommodate our individual and collective interests. Let us work together to ensure the attainment of these objectives, and to enable the United Nations to fulfil its obligations as we enter the new millennium. As the Prime Minister of Israel, I represent a State whose creation was envisioned, encouraged and advocated by the League of Nations 80 years ago and by the United Nations 50 years ago. That extraordinary recognition by the international community confirmed what the Jewish people have known and felt for two millennia: the bond between the people of Israel and the land of Israel is eternal, and the rebirth of the Jewish State in the land of Israel is a historic imperative. Religious and non-religious people alike have viewed this rebirth as a modern miracle, the realization of the vision of the Hebrew prophets. Yet ever since that miracle occurred, we have all been hoping that it would be accompanied by the fulfilment of another biblical prophesy: “nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.” (The Holy Bible, Isaiah 2:4) It was in fact in that spirit that the founders of Israel stretched out the hand of peace to our neighbours in our Declaration of Independence some 50 years ago. Now, half a century later, as we view with pride our nation?s extraordinary accomplishments and achievements, we are determined to complete the circle of peace around us. No people have suffered more from war and violence than the Jewish people and no one wants peace more than we do. I know that that is not a common perception of us. I, personally, am often accused of not wanting peace. Nothing could be further from the truth. I have been on the fields of battle. I have seen my comrades fall. I have two small children at home. I want a future free of war — a future of peace, for them and for Palestinian children like them. We want peace for us and for the Palestinian people, whose prolonged suffering has been one of the cruel consequences of the wars waged against us. We are willing to make painful compromises for peace. We hope that the Palestinians are ready to make those necessary compromises as well. What is at stake is our life together in a very small land, and there is no reason that we should not be able to live together. All of us are, after all, the sons and daughters of Abraham. As we search for peace, we naturally encounter crises and stalemates, frustrations and obstacles — that is inevitable in any negotiating process. But only negotiations can solve our problems. An outcome which is not the result of negotiations is an invitation to continued conflict. Negotiations accompanied by violence and threats of violence are an invitation to failure. T h e option of violence must therefore be totally discarded and permanently disavowed. Peace will be achieved only by heeding the call made by two great leaders, the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israel?s former Prime Minister Menachem Begin. Twenty-one years ago they declared in Jerusalem, “No more war. No more bloodshed”. The Treaty they hammered out at Camp David was a historic turning point which changed the face of our region. It has benefited both countries and brought hope to all of us, as has the peace with Jordan, which is a model peace for all our neighbours. King Hussein?s contribution to this peace, his devotion to the advancement of our relationship and his efforts to help the peace process with the Palestinians have been invaluable. In the name of the people of Israel and, I am sure, on behalf of all the peoples and Governments represented in the Assembly, I want to send King Hussein our most heartfelt wishes for a quick and complete recovery. I believe we can achieve a successful peace agreement with the Palestinians as well. But for that peace to endure, it must be based on two principles. The first is security. A peace that cannot be defended will not last. That is the central lesson of the twentieth century. None of us can afford to forget this lesson, least of all the Jewish people. As the Prime Minister of the one Jewish State, I must ensure Israel?s ability to defend itself, regardless of criticism and misunderstanding by those who do not share this responsibility. The second principle of a durable peace is reciprocity. Only agreements honoured by both sides can be successful. The agreement between Israel and the Palestinians is at bottom based on a simple equation: the Palestinians receive jurisdiction in the territory in which they live, and in return they prevent terrorist attacks against Israel from those territories. Israel has been fulfilling its part of this agreement: 100 per cent of the Palestinians in the Gaza district and 98 per cent of the Palestinians in Judean Samaria, known as the West Bank, are now living under Palestinian rule. They enjoy the 13 attributes of self-government: they have their own flag, their own executive, legislative and judiciary bodies and their own police force. It can no longer be claimed by anyone that Israel is occupying the Palestinians. We do not govern their lives. But we cannot accept a situation in which they will threaten our lives, and that is of paramount concern to us as we approach further redeployment. The territory we are negotiating about is virtually uninhabited by Palestinians — there are only a few thousand Bedouins there who roam about. Yet this land is the canvas on which thousands of years of Jewish history have been etched. And it has powerful implications for our security. We should remember that at its widest point Israel is all of 50 miles wide, and should it cede all of the West Bank, as some so cavalierly tell us to do, that distance would be reduced to the distance between this building and La Guardia airport. How many Governments and leaders would put their nations at such risk? None. Yet we are prepared to undertake careful, controlled and calculated risks for peace. Nevertheless, to part with one square inch of this land is agonizing for us, and for me personally. Every stone and every hill and valley that I have walked — I know them intimately, as do my people — resonates with our forefathers? footsteps, from the cradle of Jewish civilization through the biblical kings and prophets and the sages, scholars and poets of Israel, down to our own time. Yet in the spirit of compromise and reconciliation we have agreed to transfer to Palestinian jurisdiction some of this hallowed land, provided that the principles of security and reciprocity are kept. This means that Israel would retain the ability to defend itself, and that the Palestinians would fulfil their commitments, first and foremost to shun violence and fight terrorism. Under the Oslo and Hebron agreements, which I signed, the Palestinian Authority and Chairman Arafat agreed to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure and arrest and prosecute terrorist operatives. They agreed to collect and dispose of illegal weapons, imprison and hand over wanted murderers and reduce the Palestinian police to the numbers prescribed in the Oslo agreements. That has not been done to date. They also agreed to cease the vicious daily propaganda on official Palestinian television; there are Sesame Street programmes which exhort five-year olds to become suicide warriors. This, I am afraid, is education for war, not for peace. And they agreed that they must complete the annulment of the Palestinian Charter, which can only be done by the Palestinian National Council. That Charter is still on the books and still on the Internet — if representatives turn it on they can find it. It still calls for Israel?s destruction thorough armed struggle, which is a euphemism for terrorism. So I say today to our Palestinian partners “Choose peace. Fight for peace. You cannot talk peace and tolerate terrorism”. Of course, terrorism endangers our peace, but it is also a global cancer. Many leaders today understand this, as President Clinton made abundantly clear from this very podium a few days ago. But what makes the terrorism rooted in the Middle East so pernicious and so dangerous is that the terrorists invoke a distorted, twisted and fanatic interpretation of Islam, which is very distant from enlightened Islam. We have no quarrel with Islam. It is one of the world?s great religions, and we have admiration and respect for its institutions and its teachings. But fanatic Islamist terrorism is religion betrayed, and it not only threatens us but undermines Arab Governments and societies. It endangers the peace of the world. For terrorism to be defeated, terrorists must be punished and deterred, and the climate of support they enjoy in various lands must disappear. That is the only way that terrorism will decline and its growth be arrested and that it will ultimately be rooted out from our lives. The elimination of terrorism will undoubtedly lead to prosperity in our region. We envision a market-based regional economy between Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority. As I speak we are lifting the barriers to trade, eliminating red tape and promoting joint business ventures between the parties. Trade between Israel and the Palestinians has shot up enormously in the last two years because our policy is a liberal policy. If things are better for them economically, things are better for us. I should like to give an example relating to the transfer of value added tax (VAT) from Palestinian workers working in Israel, whose numbers have grown enormously in the last two years. Three years ago we transferred about 700 million shekels to the Palestinian Authority from the work of Palestinian workers in Israel. This year that figure will reach 2 billion shekels. That is almost a threefold increase in three years. Representatives do not know that; none of them knows that we have dramatically improved the Palestinian economy because we believe that life better for them is life better for us. The absence of violence will enable all of us, Palestinians, Jordanians, Egyptians and Israelis, and, I may add, Syrians and Lebanese — this is not a far- 14 fetched dream; it is certainly one that I have — to reach a standard of living and quality of life now considered unimaginable. Once we complete the current talks we will begin negotiations for the final settlement — a final settlement of peace with the Palestinian Authority. I urged starting these negotiations a year ago, but I regret to say that my offer was turned down. This phase is long overdue. But as the late Yitzhak Rabin noted, no dates in the Oslo accords are sacrosanct. No target date in them was met on schedule. This failure to meet deadlines did not put an end to the agreement. The Oslo accords are not about meeting deadlines. Their essential purpose is to reach a peace agreement through negotiations. An arbitrary, unilateral declaration of a Palestinian State, in disregard of this basic purpose of Oslo, would constitute a fundamental violation of the Oslo accords. It would cause the complete collapse of the process. I strongly urge the Palestinian Authority not to take this course. Such actions will inevitably prompt unilateral responses on our part, and that development would not be good for the Palestinians, not good for Israel, and not good for peace. We must continue to negotiate, earnestly, continuously and tirelessly until a final peace agreement is reached. No other way will do. What would such a peace look like? I envision its success would lie in ensuring the following balance: the Palestinians should have all the powers to govern their lives and none of the powers to threaten our lives. They will have control of all aspects of their society, such as law, religion and education; industry, commerce and agriculture; tourism, health and welfare. They can prosper and flourish. What they cannot do is endanger our existence. We have a right to ensure that the Palestinian entity does not become the base for hostile forces, including foreign forces. We have a right to ensure that it does not become a base and haven for terrorists. In some cases we are talking about a base — in New York city terms — five blocks away, and without the East River. We are talking about something that is not hypothetical. As I prepared this speech, I was informed of a terrorist attack — another one — in Jerusalem, in a bus station. Happily, no one was killed today. But can we be sure? We are seeking a peace that is peaceful, that is not violent — a peace without terror, which is the only peace that means anything. Nor can we accept the mortal threat of weapons such as anti-aircraft missiles on the hills above our cities and airfields. If any representatives were to land at Tel Aviv airport — as many have in the past — their planes could be endangered by the inability of Israel, in a permanent peace settlement, to control the importation of these lethal weapons. This is the great challenge of the permanent status negotiations: to achieve a durable peace that will strike a balance between Palestinian self-rule and Israeli security. This peace can be achieved by negotiation, and negotiation alone. There is no other way. Negotiation for peace is what we want with Lebanon and Syria as well. As representatives know, over six months ago our Government announced an initiative to implement Security Council resolution 425 (1978). In our decision, we said that Israel was prepared to withdraw from south Lebanon provided that one condition was met: that there would be security arrangements to ensure the safety of the civilian population on both sides of the Lebanese-Israeli border. I can report that I find myself now in the bizarre position of offering to withdraw from an Arab country and meeting with Arab refusal to negotiate such a withdrawal. But I can also report that we remain hopeful. We have not abandoned this initiative. Peace with Syria and Lebanon will complete the circle of peace with our immediate neighbours. But the achievement of a lasting peace in our region requires addressing the ominous existential dangers which still threaten Israel beyond the immediate horizon. Both Iran and Iraq continue their efforts to acquire non-conventional weapons and ballistic missiles with strategic reach. Iran has just successfully tested an intermediate-range missile. Iraq has declared that it will no longer accept international inspections of its non-conventional programmes, inspections mandated by Security Council resolutions. These developments threaten not only Israel, but all the nations represented in this Hall. In the hands of the rogue regimes of the Middle East, weapons of mass destruction may pose a greater threat to the world, and to world peace, than anything we have known in the past. I want to caution members about something else: to let sweet talk by leaders of these regimes lull us into inaction is to repeat the worst mistakes of this century. What is required instead is concerted international action to prevent disaster. 15 That, after all, is what this body was established to do. And if it is to live up to its founders? expectations, it will have to be far more adept at distinguishing between fanatical aggressors and their intended victims. I believe that the United Nations can help foster a climate of peace and stability in our region by encouraging the reactivation of the multilateral committees conceived at the Madrid Conference. By addressing such issues as regional economic development, arms control, the resolution of refugee problems, water and the environment, these committees can produce the important building blocks of peace. But ultimately, as in every conflict, the crucial decisions must be made by the peoples of the Middle East themselves. They must decide whether the region will continue to be an arena for terrorism and war or become a full participant in a peaceful, prosperous global economy. Cooperation and peace can give the Middle East a leading position in the world of the next millennium. Violence, terrorism and war will assure stagnation and misery. Deep in our hearts, we know which choice we want for our children. My wife and I hope that when our two little boys grow up, the only competition they will engage in with Palestinian boys, and Egyptian boys, and Jordanian and Syrian and Lebanese boys, will be on football fields and in debating societies. It is characteristic of the Jewish people to live in hope. It is the name of our national anthem. It is what has made it possible for us, despite unparalleled persecution, despite the most horrific calamities to befall any people or any nation, clinging to hope, to contribute as much as we have to human progress in the past 4,000 years. And this hope is reflected in the prayer we utter this week as we celebrate the Jewish new year. It is a wish we extend from our eternal capital Jerusalem, the city of peace, to all our neighbours and to all present here today: “May the year and its maledictions end, and a new year and its blessings begin”. Shana tova — may you have a good year.   May I convey to you, Sir, on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, our felicitations on your unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. With a person of your eminence and experience in the Chair, our session is assured of a successful outcome. To your predecessor, Hennadiy Udovenko, I express our deep appreciation for a job well done. We truly had a reform Assembly. It was a matter of great satisfaction for Bangladesh to support his brilliant work on United Nations reform, especially through our role as the Chairman of the Administrative and Budgetary Committee. We are particularly grateful that, at the concluding meeting of the fifty-second session, he appealed to the international community for solidarity with the people of Bangladesh at a time when our country was inundated by the worst floods in our history. In this yearâs unprecedented floods, two thirds of our country was completely inundated and nearly 31 million people were affected. Over 20 million were rendered homeless. Immense damage was done to crops, roads, bridges, clinics, schools and industrial plants. With the receding of the flood waters, we are bracing ourselves for the even greater problems of water-borne diseases and scarcity of food and safe drinking water, compounded by homelessness and unemployment. Under the direct supervision of Prime Minster Sheikh Hasina, we are reaching out to the affected people with assistance. The enormous scale of damage challenges us with a task of colossal magnitude. The cost of relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction has been estimated at approximately $900 million. The United Nations system, I am happy to say, has responded to our needs and requirements, as have our development partners and many friendly countries. On behalf of the Government and the people of Bangladesh, we would like to express our sincere thanks to Secretary- General Kofi Annan for his support for and solidarity with Bangladesh at this hour of need. We are also thankful to the diplomatic missions stationed in Dhaka, the international organizations, non-governmental organizations and Bangladesh nationals abroad for their continued support, understanding and sympathy towards Bangladesh and its efforts to face the challenges. I reiterate here the appeal made by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for the generous and continuing support of the international community to Bangladesh in the coming days. Floods are not unknown in Bangladesh. Flooding as we have been experiencing this year is unprecedented both in magnitude and duration. The Secretary-General in his annual report has referred to threats to human security, including natural disasters. Indeed, of all natural disasters floods cause the most widespread havoc and misery. Bangladesh, of course, is not the only country to have suffered severe flooding this monsoon season. The cause of this yearâs floods may well be complex. We cannot help but be perturbed, however, by the observation in the Human Development Report of this year that global warming could permanently flood large areas and play havoc with harvests. The report cautions that the human consequences of global warming can be devastating for many poor countries like Bangladesh, which could see its land area shrunk by as much as 17 per cent with a one metre rise in sea level. Elements and factors that affect the global ecosystem and the environment are interlinked. They transcend national frontiers and can be addressed meaningfully only by nations acting in concert. It is a matter of survival for many peoples, and the highest priority should be given to this issue. We have come a long way since Rio, and yet, very few tangible benefits have been achieved in the absence of promised new and additional resources. Since assuming office following elections in June 1996, our Government has been trying to put in place and strengthen institutions and laws that will reinforce democracy and promote good governance. In December last year, we negotiated an end to the long-standing problem in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The Chittagong Hill Tracts Agreement was concluded within the framework of our Constitution, and it fully meets the legitimate concerns of the tribal population. We are now putting into place the necessary laws and institutional machinery pertaining to the Agreement and widening developmental activities in the area. My Government welcomes cooperation in this effort from all our development partners. Our commitment to democracy and the rule of law has prompted us to accord priority to human rights. We are in the process of setting up an independent national 28 human rights commission. Our objective is to take the human rights issue to the grass-roots level, to increase awareness among our people of their rights that have been guaranteed by our Constitution and to make the process of justice accessible and affordable to all. A lot remains to be done, and we have made a good beginning. Bangladesh believes in the centrality of the right to development within the human rights regime. The implementation of the right to development will be further enhanced through a binding international treaty on this right. We are therefore very pleased that at the recent summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Durban, the heads of State and Government endorsed our Prime Minsterâs proposal that consideration be given to the preparation of a convention on the right to development. At home we have also embarked on a comprehensive programme of reform and deregulation. Social development has remained the main focus of our development strategy. Education, health care, employment generation and womenâs empowerment within the broad framework of human development continue to receive priority attention. We are focusing on the rights of women and children. The role and involvement of civil society in our development efforts, particularly in the social sector, have been remarkable. The process of globalization and liberalization brings risks, grave challenges and opportunities, but in unequal ways. The external economic shocks associated with this process are too powerful for the vulnerable economies to absorb. This is now being recognized even by the beneficiaries of globalization. As has been said, the globalization process must reflect a more inclusive vision of shared interests and shared values. We would support the views of the Secretary-General of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that a global economy should mean that no one will be left behind. We need to ensure that the process of globalization and liberalization meets our development needs. We need to formulate a positive and workable agenda for ensuring that globalization promotes equity and benefit for all. An integral component of the globalization process is unfettered movement of the factors of production, including capital and labour. We need to encourage migration of labour in order to ensure balance in globalization. Official development assistance in real terms has declined by more than 15 per cent from 1992 to 1996. This decline must be halted and reversed. For the poorest and more vulnerable economies, official development assistance remains indispensable. We call on all developed countries to reach the agreed target of 0.7 per cent for the developing countries and 0.15 to 0.2 per cent for the least developed countries as soon as possible, preferably by 2000. The least developed countries represent the most vulnerable economies and peoples of the world. The ministerial communiquÃ© issued after the 1998 substantive session of the Economic and Social Council underscored certain timely issues. In particular, I would mention the call for working together for enhanced market access for the least developed countries and to support their efforts at capacity-building. We also welcome the call for further progress towards zero tariff on exports from least developed countries. Preferential treatment accorded to least developed countries should not be time-bound. The restrictive trade regimes of labour and environmental standards should be made flexible. We need to adequately prepare to address these and other relevant issues in the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, to be held in 2001. The situation in the least developed countries in particular makes it clear that the eradication of poverty continues to be our overriding concern. It is essential to ensure long-term global security, as well as to achieve sustainable, economic and social development. We believe that the goal of the Microcredit Summit held last year, to reach 100 million of the worldâs poorest families, especially the women of those families, will become a reality by the year 2005. Effective microcredit programmes provide access to small capital to people living in poverty in many countries of the world. In addition to the eradication of poverty, the microcredit programmes have also been contributing to the social and human development process, particularly the empowerment of women. As the Secretary-General has noted in his annual report, the world has been free from large-scale regional conflict over the past year. Peace on a global scale and in a meaningful sense, however, still remains a distant goal. The post-cold-war reality underscores that we need to build a culture of peace based on the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and on respect for human rights, democracy, tolerance and wider and equal participation of people in all spheres of human activity. We welcome the proclamation of the year 2000 as the International Year for the Culture of Peace and the 29 proposed proclamation of the period 2001 to 2010 as the international decade for the culture of peace and non- violence for the children of the world. The Secretary- General has been requested to submit a draft declaration and programme of action on the culture of peace to this session. We hope it will be possible for the General Assembly to adopt these documents at the earliest opportunity. We are particularly concerned that hopes for a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East are yet to be fulfilled. The framework for such a peace exists in the relevant Security Council resolutions, the principles of the Madrid Conference and the Oslo accords. The principle of land for peace has been accepted by all, and yet our Palestinian brethren continue to be frustrated in their hopes and aspirations. New settlements, expansion of the Jerusalem municipal area and large-scale internment of Palestinians without fair trial cannot promote the cause of peace. Bangladesh strongly believes that nothing should be allowed to thwart the peace process. We would urge that every moral pressure and persuasion be brought to bear upon the Israeli authorities so that the peace process can progress to its logical culmination. We look forward to the early establishment of an independent, sovereign State of Palestine, with Jerusalem as its capital, and to its full membership of the United Nations. The cause of the sufferings of our brothers and sisters in many African countries, particularly in the Great Lakes region, needs to be addressed more comprehensively. The recent plight of the people of Kosovo is a stark reminder of the not-so-distant events of Bosnia. Peace initiatives in Afghanistan have yet to make any headway. Peace in that country has to be built from within. The problem of Afghanistan can only be resolved by the Afghan people themselves, without outside interference. In such cases, we believe in the significant role that the United Nations can play as a peace-builder. In the area of arms control and disarmament, some noteworthy progress has been made. The Ottawa Convention on anti-personnel landmines will soon come into force. We welcome the decision of the Conference on Disarmament to set up committees on security assurances to non-nuclear-weapon States and also on fissile materials. For Bangladesh, the pursuit of general and complete disarmament is a constitutional commitment, and we are ready to support any and every move that contributes to this objective. The nuclear tests in South Asia have been the subject of much debate, discussion and concern. In this connection, the initiative of Bangladeshâs Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed to minimize tensions in the region through personal visits and by urging all concerned to contribute towards strengthening peace in South Asia and the world has been widely appreciated. We attach great importance and priority to our relations with our neighbouring countries. We are happy at the announcement of moratoriums on further nuclear testing, and we remain committed to the goal of a nuclear- weapons-free world. We believe that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), to which Bangladesh is a party, provide useful frameworks for establishing a nuclear-weapons-free world. It was a pity to observe that consensus could not be reached in the Conference on Disarmament to set up an ad hoc committee for nuclear disarmament. Last year, our Secretary-General submitted to the General Assembly a package of reform proposals to make the United Nations more streamlined and attuned to present-day problems and realities. Some major decisions were, in fact, adopted by the fifty-second session on the basis of these proposals. This session of the Assembly, we believe, will continue the reform process, resolving in particular the issues relating to the development account, results-based budgeting and the so-called sunset clause. Reforms have, by definition, to be a continual process. The United Nations has to be adapted to new conditions and problems. On this there can be no two opinions. For the past five years we have been discussing the issue of Security Council reform and expansion. We have articulated our particular concerns in different working groups and forums. At the recent Non-Aligned Movement summit in Durban, the Movementâs collective position was reaffirmed. I would also stress that it is the weaker and more vulnerable group of countries that has the most vital stake in a dynamic and effective United Nations and its Security Council. These countries constitute a clear majority among the 185 Member States, and their concerns should not be overlooked or glossed over in any reform or restructuring exercise. While stalemate continues in this area, we are pleased that an International Criminal Court has seen the light of the day after so many years of efforts. Despite shortcomings, the Court is a milestone in United Nations history. Bangladesh attaches great importance to the coordinated and integrated follow-up to the decisions taken at the major United Nations conferences of the 1990s, as an area which contributes effectively to the reform process. We believe that the outcomes of these conferences provide the international community with the 30 most important opportunity to ensure a better life for the peoples of the world at the outset of the twenty-first century. In particular, we call for concerted efforts to ensure the success of the special session of the General Assembly next June for the follow-up to the Cairo population conference. We also welcome the proposed millennium Assembly session and hope that it will look into the issues that will challenge us in the coming decades. This Assembly session should be our outreach into the future. The end of all political efforts, as a former United Nations Secretary-General once observed, must be the well- being of the individual in a life of safety and freedom. This is a goal to which no one is averse. It is also something that no nation can achieve on its own in a world that is increasingly interdependent. Peace and security and development in a real sense are indivisible. Despite the increasing complexities it faces every day, the United Nations is functioning today more effectively and efficiently than before. In recent times it has played a far more constructive and positive role. The United Nations, of course, has its critics and, indeed, may even benefit from constructive criticism. There is always scope for change and improvement. The United Nations has had its share of failures, which so often seem much more glaring than its quiet successes. There can be no doubt that it remains the sole universal platform for humanity to chart its future in the new millennium.  It was the wish of His Excellency Mr. Bakili Muluzi, President of the Republic of Malawi, to come and address the General Assembly in person, but owing to pressing commitments at home he has been unable to do so. I therefore deliver this statement on his behalf. Let me join preceding speakers in conveying deep sympathy to the peoples of the Caribbean region and of the southern United States with regard to the natural disaster, in the form of a hurricane, which has struck them over the past few days. Let me congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti on his election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly and to affirm our confidence in his ability to conduct the work of this session successfully. I would like also to pay a special tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for the innovative and constructive manner in which he carried out his task during the fifty-second session. His wit and sense of humour helped the Assembly accomplish so much during a very difficult session, which was probably a turning- point in the work of the United Nations. The reforms that we agreed upon during the reform Assembly should surely provide the necessary momentum for a more efficient and effective United Nations. Let me also express my sincere appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, especially for the manner in which he has shouldered his important responsibilities. His outstanding leadership role, particularly with regard to United Nations reform, the problems of my own continent, Africa, and during the recent Iraq crisis has put the United Nations back at centre stage in its meaningful engagement in international affairs. We encourage the Secretary-General to continue his good work with the same dynamic spirit so as to better adapt the Organization to the current and future needs of mankind. Malawi fully supports the reforms that are being undertaken by the United Nations. We have no doubt that they will not only increase the effectiveness and efficiency of our Organization, but also enable it to respond effectively and in a timely manner to new challenges. I particularly welcome the creation of the post of Deputy Secretary-General. I believe that with this new office the United Nations will continue to play a central role in promoting economic and social development and enhancing assistance for development, particularly to developing countries. The development agenda, focusing on the eradication of poverty and the provision of basic amenities to humankind, corresponds to the efforts of the Organization in the area of peace and security. They indeed complement each other. Malawi looks forward to the finalization of the remaining issues on the reform package, including proposals on the Millennium Assembly, which we fully support. This year’s session of the General Assembly comes at a time when we are commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We believe it is now time to take stock of the progress that has been made in the promotion and protection of human rights since the Universal Declaration 21 was adopted in 1948 and identify additional ways and means to help enhance the promotion and protection of human rights universally. The United Nations machinery for the promotion and protection of human rights has done an impeccable job in the past, and Malawi places a lot of trust in it to do even better in the near future, particularly in a reformed United Nations where a human rights culture will permeate the system as a whole. While recognizing the critical role played by the United Nations in this field, we also believe that Member States hold the key to a world free of impunity, a global society where human rights transcend all our apparent divisions. We should therefore not only preach the promotion and protection of human rights but also put into practice what we preach and deepen our understanding of the subject. Since the concept of human rights may not be clearly understood by many sectors of our societies, the success of building a human rights culture across our societies will depend on the ability of our Governments and civil society to provide civic education to the people. In Malawi we have created necessary institutions, such as the Human Rights Commission, the Law Reform Commission, the Office of the Ombudsman and the Anti- corruption Bureau which, together with various non- governmental organizations, are playing a critical role in enhancing a deeper understanding of human rights as well as related issues of governance. As we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, our optimism about a better future based on the rule of law and respect for the rights of others has been further fortified by the adoption last July in Rome of the Statute on the establishment of the International Criminal Court. Malawi fully supports this Court and looks forward to the early entry into force of the Statute and the finalization of the outstanding issues before the Preparatory Commission. However, we pause in our optimism about a better world because of certain trends and developments. Malawi is particularly disturbed by the recent wave of terrorist acts. Terrorism is a threat to peace, security and stability, and therefore cannot be condoned in whatever form or manifestation. We condemn terrorism and reject this cowardly phenomenon as a means of resolving disputes, misunderstandings or political differences. We believe that collectively we should redouble our efforts to deal with terrorism by establishing more measures aimed at its total elimination. Malawi also strongly condemns the barbaric acts of terrorism that took place during August in Nairobi, Kenya; Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania; Omagh, Northern Ireland; and Cape Town, South Africa. Similarly, we are gravely concerned about the amassing of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, which threaten the future of mankind. Recent tests by some countries confirm our fears. We cannot place blame on these countries alone, so long as others possess these weapons. The Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) regimes are not an end in themselves. We believe that our ultimate goal should be the complete elimination of all these dangerous weapons within a specific time frame, so as to guarantee the safety of the world. As we approach the new millennium, it is important that all the existing contradictions which hinder the achievement of global peace and security be removed. One way of doing this is to abide by relevant international instruments. In this regard, I wish to inform the Assembly that Malawi has recently ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Convention on anti-personnel mines. Malawi welcomes the coming into force of the Convention on anti-personnel mines. We appeal to all States which have not yet done so to become parties to these instruments without further delay. Malawi has a long-standing history of peace, as well as social and political stability. In 1994 Malawians opted for a democratic multi-party system of government which guarantees fundamental freedoms to every citizen. In the last four years we have established democratic institutions that stand for the rule of law and good governance, as well as respect for fundamental freedoms such as transparency and accountability. We have managed to achieve these because of the peace and stability that now prevail in our country. The right to peace is a right that we cherish for all. The development that we seek for the world cannot be realized without security and peace. Within our region Malawi attaches considerable importance to cooperation with respect to conflict prevention and resolution. The commendable work undertaken through the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution deserves special mention. Given the magnitude and complexity of the problems to be resolved, that body needs increased support from the international community to accomplish its laudable goals. 22 We believe that the best way to resolve disputes or conflicts in order to guarantee durable peace, security and stability is through amicable negotiation and not force. Malawi therefore welcomes the Secretary-General’s report on Africa and the interest it has generated. We are encouraged by the positive interventions that the United Nations has made to date. The debate of the Security Council last week at Foreign Minister level will only fortify Africa’s resolve to galvanize its collective political will. Indeed, Malawi applauds the commitment of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security. Despite all the efforts of the United Nations — during which many have lost their lives in the service of peace — conflicts and factional wars continue in various parts of the world, causing death, massive displacements of populations and floods of refugees and loss of property. Angola, Kosovo, Afghanistan and other parts of the globe continue to furnish tragic examples of the problems that beset us. We are disturbed by developments in Angola. The delay in the implementation of the Lusaka peace accord and the non-compliance with various Security Council resolutions are of grave concern to us. The people of Angola deserve much better. The ultimate tribute to the late Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye and all the many others that have died in the quest for peace would be the restoration of peace and reconciliation in Angola. We therefore call on UNITA in particular to take all necessary steps to facilitate the implementation of the remaining issues under the Lusaka peace accord in order to give the people of Angola a chance for peace and security. We are equally concerned with the developments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Malawi supports the decisions taken by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) at its recent summit meeting in Mauritius. Peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the whole Great Lakes region will only make Africa realize its vast potential. In Burundi, the Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, the Comoros and Guinea-Bissau, and between Ethiopia and Eritrea, dialogue must prevail in the search for solutions to the problems that affect them. We call on all parties to give a peaceful resolution of their problems a chance in order for them to achieve a lasting solution. Kosovo and Afghanistan continue to bleed, while hunger and despair ravage the southern belly of the Sudan, and the humanitarian crisis in Somalia continues. The international community can indeed make a difference. In Sierra Leone, we express our relief that the democratically elected Government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah has resumed its rightful place. We applaud the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the OAU in this regard. We support the initiatives that President Kabbah is pursuing as the country starts the long, slow process of reconstruction and rehabilitation. Malawi welcomes the developments in Nigeria, and we encourage President Abubakar to forge ahead with all the necessary reforms towards the restoration of democratic rule in Nigeria. In Western Sahara, Malawi is following the developments with keen interest. We welcome the Houston accords and look forward to the referendum later in the year. The overwhelming adoption on 7 July last of resolution 52/250 on Palestine was a clear manifestation of the international community’s desire to begin a new chapter in the Middle East. As with civilization, peace and security in the Middle East would no doubt have a reverberating effect on developments in world affairs as we enter into the next century. We call upon Israel and the Palestinian Authority to bring fresh impetus to their negotiations. Malawi welcomes the current initiatives aimed at giving new momentum to the negotiations. Malawi also welcomes the recent developments on the question relating to the Lockerbie disaster. We trust these developments will lead to an early resolution of the matter and therefore an urgent lifting of sanctions against Libya. One of the major issues for the United Nations is the concern for national identity. In this century nations have been born. Great nations have disintegrated, while others have found new solutions and come back together. It is in this spirit of helping the powers of healing that Malawi stands to reiterate its conviction that the question of the participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the activities of the United Nations on the basis of respect for the principle of universality and the sovereign equality of States deserves consideration. Malawi believes that appropriate participation by the Republic of China on Taiwan in the international community would be an important factor for peace, stability and international cooperation in that part of the world. Malawi will hold general elections next year. This follows the multiparty elections held in 1994, the first in 30 years. During that election, the United Democratic Front took the reins of power following a free, fair and credible electoral process. The change that we decided upon is irreversible, and all necessary measures are being 23 taken to consolidate the new dispensation. We are committed to facilitating the exercise by all of our people of their civil and political rights. The Government of Malawi is committed to holding free and fair presidential and parliamentary elections. We therefore invite the international community to come to Malawi and witness the electoral process. At the same time, we appeal to it, particularly development partners, to help us with logistical, financial and human resource support. Free and fair elections can be realized only through the provision of adequate resources. We expect the United Nations to play a critical role in this overall effort, which the people of Malawi so desire. Since the multiparty Government was ushered in, it has striven to increase the pace of economic reform in Malawi. We value economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development, in the same way as we do civil and political rights. We believe that the private sector should be the engine of economic growth and that the duty of the Government is to create a conducive environment. In this respect, the Government of Malawi has embarked on a privatization process, disengaging itself from the commercially oriented parastatals. Apart from the conducive investment climate obtaining in Malawi, banking and financial services have also been liberalized. The economic and financial reforms that we have embarked on can be successfully sustained only if they are backed by adequate support from the international community, including a favourable international economic climate. The world trade and financial outlook, however, appears hostile for commodity-dependent countries like Malawi. As we approach the next millennium, the negative effects of globalization and liberalization, particularly on weak economies, should be addressed with the necessary resolve and in a holistic fashion. The persistence of poverty in the world, particularly in Africa, requires the elaboration within the various bodies of coherent policies to confront the major problems that impede development. External debt, deteriorating terms of trade, difficulties in or lack of access to international markets, declining official development assistance and the negative effect of structural adjustment programmes all form a myriad of issues that require urgent attention. All these issues have to be addressed within the context of the need for the rational utilization of the world’s natural resources and the need to protect the environment. The world cannot remain aloof as poverty and despair wreak havoc on many of our people. The many gains that we will have made in civil and political rights will have no meaning at all if the socioeconomic ills that the people confront are not addressed. We are encouraged by the high-level dialogue held here recently. What is needed is action to realize fully the economic, social and cultural rights that we also seek. The founding fathers of this Organization gave us an instrument which has withstood the test of time. It remains a relevant instrument. As we prepare for the third millennium, let us operationalize it in partnership for the global community, so that we may together triumph over suffering and despair.  Allow me first of all to sincerely congratulate the President on his unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session, and to express confidence that under his efficient leadership the Assembly will cope successfully with the complex issues before it. I would like to express our special gratitude to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, whose vast experience and great professionalism greatly contributed to the success of the previous session, and whose work as President during the fifty-second session epitomized the United Nations commitment to the process of transformation aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the Organization. All aspects of life in Azerbaijan are covered by the process of radical reform directed at creating a democratic, secular society governed by the rule of law and based on a market economy. In spite of the current objective difficulties caused by the consequences of armed conflict and the problems inherent in the transitional period, Azerbaijan does not see any alternative to the course of democratic transformation it has taken, and considers the strengthening of its democratic institutions a priority of its State policy. Respect for fundamental political and civil rights and freedoms, the functioning of the multi-party system, the protection of the interests of each citizen in our society irrespective of ethnic origin, independence of the judiciary, as well as the advancement of other elements of democratic society, are guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan, which was adopted on 12 13 November 1995 in a national referendum. A great deal has been done to bring the legislative system of the country in line with relevant international standards. Presidential elections that are to take place in Azerbaijan on 11 October this year will constitute a milestone in the process of further strengthening the democratic foundation of the society. Actions already undertaken by the leadership of the country have laid the foundation for genuinely free and just elections. A new law on presidential elections in the Republic of Azerbaijan was thoroughly examined by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe and meets the most rigorous international standards in this field. The election process will be observed by 300 international monitors from the OSCE, the Council of Europe and other international organizations, as well as from institutions of individual countries, such as the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs in the United States. The widest possible participation of national monitors has been provided for. The leadership of the country has declared its commitment to conducting free and just elections, considering it a significant event in the history of the Azerbaijan State. Positive developments resulting from current reforms can also be observed in the country?s economy. At the initial stage of its formation the young Azerbaijan State faced internal instability, lack of a progressive legislative basis for the market economy, disintegration of traditional economic and trade relations, economic recession and a huge budget deficit. These elements have created serious obstacles to economic development. Armed aggression by neighbouring Armenia has had the most negative impact on the situation in Azerbaijan. It has resulted in the occupation of one fifth of its territory, the emergence of about 1 million refugees and internally displaced persons and the continuance of the 10-year-old blockade of the Nakhichevan region of Azerbaijan by Armenia. The course of building a democratic society based on a market economy, taken by the leadership of the country, has created the prerequisites for drastic economic reforms. Since 1995, the Government of Azerbaijan has been implementing a comprehensive programme of economic stabilization. Fiscal, monetary and credit policies have been streamlined and structural reforms to liberalize the economy have been completed. We have achieved macroeconomic stability, as well as stability of the national currency. In fact, inflation rates have practically been reduced to zero, and since 1996 steady growth in the gross domestic product has been restored. Internal stability achieved as a result of the leadership?s consistent policy, as well as reforms implemented, have provided a favourable climate for investments in the country. Today, Azerbaijan continues with the reform of its banking system and privatization of State-owned enterprises. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for their support to the stabilization programme in Azerbaijan and for financing the structural transformations in its economy. I would like to offer our assurances of the irreversibility of the course of economic reforms taken by our Government and to express the hope that these important financial institutions will increase their assistance to Azerbaijan. In its economic policy, our country attaches the highest priority to its integration into the world economy. Situated at the junction of Eastern and Western civilization, and having been for centuries a link between Europe and Asia, Azerbaijan is implementing a systematic programme aimed at its smooth integration into the world economy, and attaches great importance to the development of fruitful and mutually beneficial regional cooperation based on mutual respect for the sovereignty and interests of all States, as well as on the principle of non-interference in internal affairs of other countries. In this connection, the country?s leadership regards as strategically important the concept of creating an East- West corridor, and in particular the development of the Europe-Caucasus-Asia transportation link. The Transport Corridor: Europe-Caucasus-Asia (TRACECA) programme, established by the Commission of the European Union in 1993, is designed to promote the development of interconnected national and regional transportation infrastructures to enhance cooperation between countries in Europe, the Black Sea region, the Caucasus, the Caspian Sea region and Asia. Implementation of this programme will provide reliable access to the trans-European and trans-Asian transportation systems for the landlocked countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia. During the last five years close interaction between the States involved in the programme and active support by the Commission of the European Union have contributed to substantial progress in modernization and construction of communications, the development of relevant laws and codes and the 14 improvement of the customs and tariff policies of participant States. The results of five years of work were reviewed at the International Conference on the Restoration of the Historic Silk Route, held at the capital of Azerbaijan, the city of Baku, on 7-8 September this year. That Conference brought together delegations from 32 countries, including nine heads of State, and representatives of 13 international organizations. The major outcome of the Conference was the signing of the Principal multilateral agreement on international transport for development of the corridor Europe-Caucasus-Asia, which is an important institutional mechanism for promoting the development and regulation of international transportation, as well as for coordinating and harmonizing transportation policies and legal frameworks in this field of transportation. The Baku Conference has become a major cornerstone in terms of strengthening and enhancing cooperation aimed at the further development of the Europe-Caucasus-Asia transportation corridor in the interests of the economic progress of all the participating States. The delegation of Azerbaijan is counting on the support of the other Member States for this programme. We are convinced that the restoration of the historic silk route and the involvement of other countries and regions in this project would provide a strong impetus to the process of rapprochement and reciprocal enrichment of our peoples, a strengthening of their independence and sovereignty, as well as the successful implementation in those States of democratic and market-oriented reforms. Carrying out plans to deliver carbohydrate resources produced by Azerbaijan and other countries of the Caspian basin to world markets by means of multiple pipelines is an integral part of the East-West concept, which is of inestimable importance for strengthening the independence and security of sovereign States, as well as for their economic and other development. We expect international financial institutions and other investors to show due interest in these projects, which can rightly be called a bridge to the third millennium. Unfortunately, however, we are obliged to admit that the model of the progressive development of sovereign States of the region proposed by Azerbaijan is not accepted by all. The position taken by Armenia in the region still remains a serious obstacle to this process. The question of a settlement of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which has lasted for more than 10 years now, is a key issue in Azerbaijan?s foreign policy. Relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the decisions of the OSCE have made it possible to create a necessary normative legal basis for the settlement of this conflict. In this context, it is necessary in particular to stress the codifying role and universality of the principles contained in the Lisbon statement made by the Chairman- in-Office of the OSCE. These principles, namely, recognition of the territorial integrity of Armenia and Azerbaijan, a high level of autonomy for Nagorny Karabakh within the Azerbaijan State and the provision of security and safety for the entire population of Nagorny Karabakh, are fully in keeping with the principles enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 and are comprehensive in nature, which makes possible their application with an equal degree of effectiveness not only to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, but to all other regional conflicts as well. A positive balance has recently been achieved. An institute of mediation has been created, comprising the Minsk Group of the OSCE and its Co-Chairmen. The parameters for the settlement process have been established, providing for the elimination of the consequences of the armed conflict and, on this basis, a resolution of the political problems. As a result of Azerbaijan?s persistence, it was possible in October 1997 to find points of contiguity with Armenia?s position, and real opportunities for progress have emerged. The subsequent internal political events in Armenia, however, and the resulting drastic revision of its attitudes led to a decline in the dynamism of the Minsk process. A just and lasting settlement cannot be achieved by Armenia?s military pressure on Azerbaijan, by its continuing occupation of parts of the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan and by increasing its military potential there, by putting forward preconditions for the resumption of negotiations on the basis of the results of Armenia?s aggression, or by imposing new procedural frameworks on the negotiations process, in order to perpetuate the situation resulting from the conflict. Illegal transfers of arms from Russia to Armenia, worth more than $1 billion, and regular joint military exercises of those countries designed to increase the offensive potential of the Armenia?s armed forces not only prevent a facilitation of the settlement, but also have a direct destabilizing impact on the situation in the region. Azerbaijan once again states its commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict and the strict 15 implementation of the ceasefire regime, until an agreement on the settlement of the armed conflict is reached, in the hopes that the same approach will be taken by the Armenian side. Azerbaijan calls on Armenia to accept the proposals of the Co-Chairmen of the Minsk Conference as a basis for negotiations within the format of the Minsk Group. Today, as never before, it is important for the international community to preserve its consistency, determination and persistence in upholding its declared position on the settlement of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Nobody should be in any doubt that progressive development of the States of the region can only be achieved through the establishment of just and lasting peace and stability in the southern Caucasian region on the basis of respect for sovereignty and the territorial integrity of its States. Azerbaijan believes that international organizations, as well as the entire international community, should more actively utilize their potential to further promote the peaceful negotiation process and the achievement of a political settlement to the conflict. During its last session, in response to the recommendations of the Secretary-General, the General Assembly adopted important decisions aimed at reforming the Organization. Azerbaijan regards the work already done to this end as a solid basis for further adaptation of the Organization to the quickly changing needs and imperatives of today?s world. We stand ready to further contribute to the implementation of these decisions intended to prepare the world Organization better to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century. Undoubtedly, in this regard, the reform of the Security Council is of special importance. In our view, it is expedient to adopt relevant decisions on this extremely sensitive issue on the basis of the broadest support of Member States and in accordance Article 108 of the Charter. Asia, Africa and Latin America should be represented in both categories of membership of the Security Council in a manner appropriate to current political realities. Given the fact that the number of countries in the Eastern European Group has doubled, we once again point out the need to allocate to that Group an additional non- permanent seat on the Security Council. Addressing the question of the reform of the Security Council and the enhancement of the efficiency of its work, we cannot fail to draw attention to the fact that the four Security Council resolutions on the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan have still not been implemented. We have repeatedly stressed that a review of the personnel policy of the United Nations should be an integral part of the Organization?s reform. We remain extremely concerned by the fact that the Republic of Azerbaijan is still not represented in the Secretariat. It is unfortunate that emergencies arising from military conflicts and acts of military aggression are still a pressing issue today. Millions of people continue to lose their homes, health and property, and are becoming internally displaced persons. The people of my country have experienced the pain and misfortune of such a loss, having fallen victim to the Armenian aggression of which I have spoken. Every seventh citizen of Azerbaijan bears the burdens of the refugee?s life, deprived of his home in his native land, suffering from heat in summer and cold in winter in temporary tent camps. In occupied Azerbaijani territory, hundreds of towns and villages have been destroyed, practically all of the houses, schools, hospitals and industrial facilities have been burned down or plundered and ancient cultural monuments have been razed. Coping with the refugee emergency and the restoration of what has been lost are two of the main concerns of the Azerbaijan State. These problems cannot be resolved until the occupying forces are withdrawn from Azerbaijani territory and all the refugees and displaced persons have been returned to the places from which they were expelled by force. The Azerbaijan Government is doing a great deal to alleviate the situation. The role of the United Nations and its agencies in this process can scarcely be overestimated. In addition to providing direct humanitarian assistance to refugees and internally displaced persons, at the present time a project is under way to restore a part of the Fisuli district, which was freed from the occupying Armenian units. This project is being carried out by the Government of Azerbaijan, the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other agencies and organizations. However, the emerging trend of reduction in the volume of humanitarian assistance to Azerbaijan cannot fail to disturb us. While expressing our most sincere gratitude to the United Nations, its specialized agencies and donor countries for their support and concrete assistance, we call on them not to decrease in the future the volume of their humanitarian aid to the people in Azerbaijan who are suffering from aggression and who live in the most unbearable conditions. 16 I should like to advantage of this opportunity to briefly refer to our cooperation with UNDP, which is playing a very positive role in the social, political and economic development of our country. Assistance from UNDP, the major source of subsidies necessary for carrying out development activities, is vital to resolve a number of serious problems in Azerbaijan that were mentioned earlier. We welcome the system of Resident Coordinators and highly commend the activity of the Resident Coordinator in Azerbaijan, designated by the Secretary-General, who is acting as the leader of the United Nations team in the country. At the same time, given the difficult financial constraints facing UNDP, I should like to call upon all Member States to increase their voluntary contributions to the budget of the Programme so that the recipient countries, including Azerbaijan, can more effectively use its potential to their advantage. The consolidation of efforts of Member States with a view to launching a decisive attack against crime, drugs and terrorism continues to be a priority. Combating these phenomena can be successful only if all countries truly join forces. Azerbaijan, which has had to confront these real threats to its sovereignty and territorial integrity, in particular from Armenian terrorism, considers itself an active participant in the fight against these evils. Azerbaijan welcomes the results of the Rome Diplomatic Conference to establish an International Criminal Court. We are convinced that an efficient, capable, independent and authoritative court will contribute to strengthening international cooperation for the effective prosecution and suppression of aggression, genocide and military crimes, which are the most heinous crimes constituting a threat to international peace and security. As a State that is experiencing all the sufferings and tragedy of aggression by Armenia, Azerbaijan is deeply interested in the establishment and effective functioning of international legal mechanisms for the prosecution of those responsible for the aforementioned crimes. There are fewer than 500 days remaining until the end of this century, and we have no time to relax, no right to rest on our laurels. Approaching the end of the historic nineties, the United Nations, bringing together both the prosperous States and those who have overcome numerous calamities but have gained their independence and stability, must take all necessary measures to justify the efforts already made and to achieve the objectives that have been set. Fulfilment of the tasks at hand and finding solutions to the problems we face constitute the baggage that this respected Organization and its Member States will take with them into the twenty-first century.  I would like at the outset to extend sincere congratulations to Mr. Opertti on his election as President of this new session, the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. I wish him every success in presiding over its meetings and conducting its work. Also, I cannot but extend heartfelt thanks to Mr. Opertti's predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of friendly Ukraine, for the efforts he expended during his presidency at the fifty- second session. I wish him success in his future endeavours. Here we come again to this universal forum, to meet, discuss and debate questions that concern our nations and peoples. This has become more necessary and pressing than ever before. The world in which we live today, and in which, God willing, future generations will live, has grown smaller in terms of geography and time, but to our great regret its problems and crises are still as great and as complicated as ever. They have even become greater and more complicated as a result of their interconnectedness and interrelated nature and the interactions among their ramifications and effects. We cannot but wonder, while sitting here within the framework of this universal, international organization, about the events and developments that occurred in our world during the past year and about those emerging questions and crises that call for our utmost attention. Have we managed to take steps towards the better world we seek for our countries and peoples? Have we succeeded in settling any of the bloody conflicts or in pacifying any region fraught with tension and any of the chronic hotbeds of tension in the network of regional and international relations? Has democracy flourished and have human rights been consolidated? Have we dealt with the problem of terrorism and succeeded in eliminating its causes and manifestations? How far have we gone in our efforts to combat the devastating scourge of drugs? And to what extent have we achieved the aspirations to put an end to poverty, misery and unemployment; to find humanitarian solutions to the phenomenon of migration and the mass flow of refugees; to eliminate international organized crime syndicates; to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in general, and nuclear weapons in particular; to halt the arms race; and to devote more resources and energy to programmes of development, education and welfare? These are major questions concerning urgent issues and problems that call for our utmost attention and efforts in order to attain these long- awaited solutions and remedies. During the past months, we have all followed the developments of the economic and monetary crises that have engulfed the States of South-East Asia and the Far East. We have seen how these developments have led these States to stagnation, inflation and social suffering after they had been models of prosperity and rapid growth for the world. Also, we are still following with grave concern the economic and financial upheaval experienced by the Russian Federation, to whose new Government I would like on this occasion to wish success in its efforts to cope with this turmoil and to extricate the country from the difficulties it is facing. Naturally, we are concerned at the prospect of the extension of the adverse consequences of these turbulent economic conditions to other States and regions of the world that have been relatively free from them so far. This brings us to the repercussions of all of this on the economies of our States in the Gulf region and the Middle East, especially in the light of the drop in the world oil prices and the decline of the revenue earned from this vital commodity on which the producing and exporting States are primarily dependent to implement their programmes and attain their development aspirations. If these developments prove one thing, it is the extent to which organic interdependence and interrelation have come to characterize the economies of the world, control its markets and define the constantly fluid relation between its producers and its consumers. This, in turn, prompts us to deal with these monetary and economic conditions from a global, open perspective free from isolationism and narrow-mindedness. It is also incumbent upon us to make the necessary efforts to cope with the present crisis on the basis of international partnership, social justice and developmental and monetary balance, and to prevent it from worsening and becoming, God forbid, a worldwide economic recession. If this were to happen, it would have extremely adverse political, social 28 and economic effects with unpredictable consequences for us all. We speak about global concerns and questions, but regional crises and conditions have not been any better during recent months. The peace to which we have aspired in our region is still, to our great regret, an elusive mirage. It is indeed very distressing, even enraging, for one to see that several years of negotiations, endeavours and mediation have failed, so far, to bring the peace process in the Middle East to its desired objective: the achievement of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace based on the principles of international legitimacy, on the resolutions of this world Organization which is hosting our current debate, and on the basis of security, stability and mutual recognition among all nations and peoples of the region. It is also regrettable that the peace process has not experienced any positive development since the coming into office of the present Government in Israel; rather, it has suffered a serious setback. At a certain time there were hopes and expectations that the Middle East was on the verge of a genuine peace allowing everyone to live in safety and tranquillity, and to enjoy equal rights. The hope was that the wars that had set the region ablaze and had bled it for so long would come to an end, to be superseded by a process of development, cooperation and prosperity. In the light of those hopes, a series of economic conferences related to the peace process was launched, the last of which was the Al-Doha Conference, after which these conferences came to a halt. This is indeed a reflection of the situation which the peace efforts reached and the difficulties that have faced and are still facing these efforts. The essential problem facing the peace process, in our view, is the fact that Israel, under its current Prime Minister and its hard-line Government, has reneged, and is still reneging, on the principles which originally formed the basis for the peace process, and on the accords concluded in the framework of that process between the former Israeli Government and its Arab neighbours. Here, I would like to remind the Israeli Government that the peace process was based on the implementation of Security Council resolutions, especially resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), regarding the need for withdrawal from the Arab territories occupied in 1967, and resolution 425 (1978) regarding southern Lebanon and the Lebanese Bekaa. This process was also based on the principle of land for peace and the attainment by the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights. We view all of these principles as international obligations, which Israel, as a State Member of the United Nations, must honour and abide by. In this regard, allow me to depart from the text of my statement to say how fervently I wish that Prime Minister Netanyahu had been sincere in his statement yesterday, when he claimed he was as interested in providing security and peace for Palestinian children as he was for his own children. However, the bitter reality with which we are all familiar says otherwise. Since Mr. Netanyahu took office, his Government has been pursuing a policy contrary to the objectives and the spirit of the peace process in the region. His failure to implement the accords signed with the Palestinian side has worsened the suffering of all segments of the Palestinian people, including the Palestinian children who suffer harsh living conditions where they lack the minimum basic requirements of life in education, health and nutrition. I wish Mr. Netanyahu had informed us of the future awaiting these children, who are chafing under the effect of the economic embargo imposed on them by his own Government. In this context, I have to underline the tragic conditions of the Palestinian people under occupation and the daily arbitrary practices they suffer at the hands of the Israeli forces, as if they had not suffered enough from 1948 until the present day. Here, I would like to single out in particular settlement activity, the confiscation of land, the demolition of houses and the driving of whole families out of their homes. All of this should strengthen our resolve to intensify efforts towards achieving a just solution that would restore to the Palestinian people their legitimate rights, including their right to establish their independent State, with holy Al-Quds as its capital, and secure the withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Arab territories in the Syrian Golan, south Lebanon and the Lebanese Bekaa in conformity with United Nations resolutions and the principles of international legitimacy. This would make it possible to speak of genuine peace in the region on a just, comprehensive basis and on the basis of mutual respect and security for all. I would also like to indicate that the decision by the Israeli Government on 21 June 1998 to expand the municipal limits of the city of Jerusalem, which would alter the legal status of the Holy City, is a direct contravention of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. Moreover, such a step contradicts the accords concluded between the Israelis and the Palestinians and violates the basis of the peace process which provides for deferring the question of 29 Al-Quds so that it would be agreed upon in the permanent status negotiations. Therefore, we express our support for the presidential statement issued by the Security Council on 13 July 1998 in response to the Israeli action. The Council called upon Israel to refrain from executing its plans and from taking any action that would prejudice the outcome of such negotiations or pre-empt the accords that they may result in. The statement also calls upon Israel to comply scrupulously with its legal obligations and responsibilities under the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949. I would also like to place on record our satisfaction with the result of the voting at the 89th meeting of the General Assembly?s fifty-second session, on 7 July 1998, which resulted in granting Palestine, in its capacity as observer in this international body, additional rights and privileges of participation in the sessions and work of the Assembly. We view this step as a simple rehabilitation and a modest step towards endorsing the membership of Palestine and its legitimate position in the framework of the United Nations and its institutions, in the hope that the day will come when, God willing, we will see the Palestine delegation representing a State admitted as a full-fledged, active member in this universal, international organization in the near future. The consolidation of peace and security, the enhancement of the principles of mutual confidence and good neighbourliness, the peaceful settlement of all conflicts and disputes through dialogue and peaceful means, and commitment to the principles of international law are the foundations of the policy of my country, Qatar, vis-à- vis our neighbours. That is why we consider the question of security and peace in the Gulf region and the Middle East a vital question of the highest priority for us and for our brothers in the Gulf Cooperation Council. From this perspective, we call for the settlement of the dispute between our sister State, the United Arab Emirates, and the friendly Islamic Republic of Iran over the islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb through bilateral diplomatic efforts or, if need be, by resorting to international arbitration. This would contribute to the evolution of Gulf-Iranian relations. On another level, the Iraqi crisis, in its turn, has been unresolved for years and there are no signs on the horizon of an impending, appropriate solution to it. With the persistence of this situation in Baghdad, which could erupt at any moment, and with all its potential for destabilizing the entire region, the condition of the Iraqi people has reached tragic proportions under the effect of the international sanctions that have been imposed upon the country for years. Whether or not we are convinced of the usefulness of these sanctions in achieving their envisaged objectives, and while we fully assert the need to implement all relevant Security Council resolutions, we would also express the hope that the embargo imposed on the Iraqi people will be lifted in order to mitigate the harsh suffering it has caused and the adverse effects it has had on these people. We view with concern the tense situation in the neighbouring region of the Horn of Africa, where States and people have suffered numerous tragedies and hardships as a result of border and civil conflicts and wars. These have resulted in the squandering of resources and potentials and aggravated the phenomena of poverty, starvation and migration. I would like to single out the Republic of the Sudan, the suffering of whose people, we hope, will end in a manner that preserves its territorial integrity and the unity of its people. We also hope that all differences among the States of the region will be settled by peaceful means and on the basis of international legitimacy, so as to ensure cooperation and good-neighbourliness among all States and peoples. Furthermore, we in the State of Qatar feel that the lifting of the embargo and sanctions imposed on the sister Libyan Jamahiriya is a basic and popular demand, especially in the wake of recent positive developments in this matter. In this regard, we would express our hope and confidence that the efforts currently under way will result in a judicial and diplomatic formula satisfactory to all parties to this question and put a definitive end to its repercussions. This would ensure the lifting of the embargo and the sanctions imposed on Libya and close the file on the Lockerbie question, while doing justice to all parties concerned. In the same vein, and proceeding from the strong attachment of the State of Qatar to the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes and from its profound belief in the necessity of consolidating security and stability and avoiding the dangers of war, hostilities and clashes of any kind, I wish to express our great concern over the regrettable events unfolding in Afghanistan and the escalation of tension along its borders with Iran. While stressing our conviction that the best means to solve the Afghan crisis in its various aspects lie in the diplomatic good offices which are proceeding under the supervision and auspices of the United Nations, we appeal 30 to the parties concerned to desist from any action to further escalate the conflict or widen its scope. Moreover, I cannot but touch upon the tragedy of the people of the Kosovo region, which is now suffering the same civil conflicts, “ethnic cleansing” and mass migration that have plagued other peoples of the former Yugoslavia. While thanking the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless efforts and initiatives to defuse tensions and settle conflicts throughout the world, we call upon him once again to continue and redouble his efforts to end these conflicts and prevent their expansion and escalation, especially in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq and Africa. The crises and conflicts I have cited are but examples of the magnitude of the challenges and tasks which we must face. There are many thorny questions and complicated problems to which all of us, the inhabitants of this planet, regardless of our different races and beliefs, must work together to seek solutions, for the sake of our future and that of our children and grandchildren. Foremost and most serious among these is the question of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including chemical, biological and, especially, nuclear weapons. A few months ago, we, like the entire world, were shocked by the disturbing developments arising from the exchange of nuclear-weapons tests by India and Pakistan and by their inherent threat of unleashing a conventional and nuclear arms race between those two large neighbours. Here, I would like to recall the position of my country on such tests: We call for the exercise of wisdom and the prompt signing by all States, without exception, of the treaties banning nuclear tests and limiting the proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction, while earnestly seeking to reduce the number of such weapons in the world in preparation for their complete elimination. This is specifically what we would like to see in our region, which, I emphasize, we would wish entirely free of weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons. In this regard, I would point out that Israel is the only nuclear-weapon State in the region and the only State that has so far refused to sign the treaties relevant to the prohibition of such weapons and the prevention of their proliferation. If it persists, this situation will lead to tension and the repercussions arising from the imbalance of power it causes. Therefore, in our view, it is necessary and imperative to take concrete steps to eliminate these weapons from the region, so as to avoid the risks of launching an arms race that would further destabilize the region. The State of Qatar also signed the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, which was concluded in Oslo. We signed it officially in Ottawa last December, prompted by our belief in the correctness of banning these mines and our awareness of the many humanitarian tragedies resulting from their use, especially among innocent civilians in the wake of the wars during which they had originally been laid. Other worldwide scourges, which we have long seen proliferate and expand, are no less serious than weapons of mass destruction in terms of their devastating and comprehensive effects on the peoples and States of the world. Drugs, organized crime, famine and the disruption of environmental and climatic conditions have all become global threats. We sincerely believe that it is impossible to tackle these threats except through comprehensive international endeavours and programmes. In this regard, I would like, on behalf of my Government, to thank and congratulate the friendly Government of Italy and the delegations of the world that participated in the United Nations Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court, which was held in Rome last June and July. It culminated in a declaration on the establishment of this Court, the jurisdiction of which will include trying those responsible for acts of genocide and war criminals. I would also like to refer to the twentieth special session of the General Assembly devoted to countering the world drug problem, held in this Hall early last June. It showed us the magnitude of this intractable problem and its serious effects on all people of the world without exception. My Government would like to thank the friendly Government of Mexico for taking the initiative of proposing to the General Assembly the convening of the special session in order to draw up a comprehensive international strategy, under the auspices of the United Nations, to cope with this problem, which threatens everybody. The need to protect and conserve the environment has become a pressing question that requires all of us, as peoples inhabiting this planet, to devote greater efforts and resources to addressing it in a framework of coordination and cooperation on a comprehensive international level and in the context of the assumption by each of us of his own responsibilities and duties. There is 31 no doubt that the environment today has been severely damaged by the faulty policies and practices still pursued by some industrial States and institutions. This damage is also a result of mankind?s age-old neglect of and indifference to its surroundings. However, the time has now come to undertake a coordinated and serious universal effort to put an end to these abuses and practices, which clearly threaten the future of the globe and all its peoples and regions with a potential calamity. The right of man to live in dignity and freedom remains. For the Government and the people of Qatar it is a sacred divine right, which we must all respect and protect. Unfortunately, we cannot confirm that human rights and man?s freedom to live in dignity and security are protected and available everywhere in today?s world. There are still numerous disturbing exceptions and violations in many regions and States of the world. Fortunately, however, we are witnessing significant progress towards substantial recognition of these legitimate human rights, of greater political, social and cultural democracy and of humanitarian and civilizational openness. It is our sincere hope and desire that that progress will be consolidated and strengthened throughout the world. In Qatar, we are especially proud that, under the auspices of His Highness the Prince Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani and under his instructions, vital pioneering steps are being taken to achieve more democracy and to consolidate participation by all segments of the population through the exercise of responsibility and freedom of choice, the guarantee of social and civil rights and civic duty, and respect for freedom of opinion, of speech and of the press within the framework of the laws and the ideals and values in which we believe and which we cherish. As we stand today at the threshold of a new century with its attendant rapid and continuous changes, transformations and surprises and face the growing number of tasks and the greater challenges they impose, we are firmly convinced of the need for readiness and preparedness to meet these challenges, undertake the tasks assigned to us and shoulder our responsibilities in a spirit of cooperation, coordination, friendship, mutual respect and commonality of interest for the benefit of our countries and peoples. Proceeding from our deep faith in God Almighty, this is the least we can do for ourselves, our countries and our peoples and for our one world. Our responsibility to the future generations dictates that we must provide for them a better world, a better life and a better future. May God guide us.    On behalf of my delegation, I should first of all like to congratulate Mr. Opertti warmly on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. My country, the Republic of Guinea, is pleased with this expression of confidence, eloquent proof of the international community?s recognition of the very positive role played by his country, Uruguay, in working for the noble ideals of our Organization. I am sure his personal qualities and great experience will ensure success at this session. I should also like to take this opportunity to convey our great appreciation to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, President of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session, for the skill, open-mindedness and efficiency of his presidency. I should also like to extend to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, the confidence of the Government of Guinea, which greatly appreciates his perceptiveness, his great wisdom and his hard work, which together are opening up new horizons for this Organization. Despite encouraging results in many areas, the United Nations still faces many challenges that threaten international peace and security and jeopardize the sustainable development of nations. It is the responsibility of the United Nations, in accordance with its purposes and principles, to become more involved in the enduring search for peace, so that the human race, on the eve of the third millennium, can establish a real foundation for the prosperity of all States. How can one ensure peace and the harmonious development of our States if the international community will not firmly commit itself to identifying and eradicating the deep causes of the many conflicts and imbalances that continue to impede mankind?s progress towards greater well-being? At a time when we are preparing to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the world?s conscience is still troubled by the indifference of the major players in the international arena in the search for appropriate solutions to the challenges that face us all. In a number of countries, peoples and individuals are deprived of fundamental rights. Civil wars continue to cause great suffering to innocent victims. It has been shown that respect for fundamental rights, including promotion of the right to development, which underlies all other rights, is an excellent instrument of preventive diplomacy today. Our session is opening at a time when the Middle East peace process is completely deadlocked. My country is following with great concern recent developments in that part of the world, particularly in the Arab territories occupied by Israel. My delegation is convinced that unless the rights of all the interested parties are taken into account, peace will remain elusive. The search for peace in the Middle East is a matter of concern to all States, first and foremost the States members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), which on several occasions has called on the Security Council and the General Assembly for greater United Nations involvement in achieving a just and lasting peace in the Middle East through the return of the occupied Arab territories, the creation of a Palestinian state and respect for the rights of all States in the region to peace and security. My delegation appeals to all parties concerned, particularly the authorities in Tel Aviv, to ensure strict implementation of the Oslo and Washington agreements, with a view to saving peace and thereby avoid the threat of another crisis that jeopardizes the balance in the subregion and international peace as a whole. The African continent continues to be a central concern of the international community. There is no need for me to enumerate the many internal conflicts that have occurred in Africa in recent years. In West Africa, the collective awareness of the member States of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) of the need to make our subregion a zone of peace, security and stability has 15 contributed, thanks to the resolve shown by our heads of State, to restoring peace in Liberia and has allowed for a return to constitutionality in Sierra Leone. These achievements, which are the result of the unanimous desire of our peoples to manage their own affairs, also attest to the vitality of the institutions of regional integration as instruments for conflict prevention, management and resolution. Here, I would appeal to the international community for more cooperation with and assistance to the peacekeeping mechanisms initiated by subregional organizations. There is a need to consolidate the great achievements of the restoration of peace in Liberia and Sierra Leone through massive assistance for their speedy reconstruction, the return of refugees and national reconciliation. If the young people who have been demobilized in these two countries do not quickly find some activity in civilian life, the temptation to return to disorder will remain. To strengthen peace and security in the West African subregion, the international community must help the economies of Liberia and Sierra Leone return to the path of growth. While ECOWAS and the international community were seeking ways and means to consolidate peace in Sierra Leone and Liberia, another conflict erupted on 7 June 1998 in Guinea-Bissau. The Government of Guinea, which has always advocated dialogue and consultation to resolve conflicts, expressed, from the beginning of this crisis, its grave concern because of the geographic, historical, social and cultural ties uniting Guinea-Bissau and my own country. The existence of a mutual defence assistance pact, signed on 25 January 1980, and the explicit invitation by the Guinea-Bissau?s democratically elected President, President João Bernardo Vieira both justified the sending of a Guinean contingent to Guinea-Bissau to preserve constitutional order and help end the war. Faithful to our policy of peace and dialogue, the Government of Guinea has been working since the beginning of this crisis in the ECOWAS Committee of Seven to find a just, negotiated solution. We believe that complementary action by the Economic Community of West African States and the contact group of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries will make it possible for us to achieve the objective of restoring peace and security in Guinea-Bissau. If we are to preserve the achievements of democratization in Africa, the international community must adopt new, more binding legal instruments prohibiting any seizure of power by force and banishing those responsible for such actions at the international, regional and subregional levels. The implementation of such measures will help to strengthen preventive diplomacy and to preserve peace and security within our States, with respect for fundamental human rights. I cannot end this section of my statement without mentioning the thorny issue of refugees and displaced persons, who are the victims of these crises. My country, the Republic of Guinea, because of its geographic location among three countries facing civil war, has of all the countries in the world the highest proportion of refugees within its territory. Over the last decade, Guinea has taken in more than 700,000 refugees, which is one tenth of our population. This massive and prolonged concentration of people has had serious social, economic and environmental consequences in the areas of Guinea concerned, and is weighing heavily on my country and its economy. I would like to reiterate here the appeal made by the Government of Guinea for substantial assistance, in accordance with Security Council and ECOWAS resolutions to help the Republic of Guinea bear the burden of these refugees. On behalf of the Government of Guinea, I should like to express our gratitude to those States that have already responded favourably to this appeal. Concerned about the situation, the United Nations Department of Political Affairs and the United Nations Development Programme organized a special meeting on the Republic of Guinea on 9 and 10 July this year in New York. The Government of Guinea appreciated this welcome initiative by the Secretary-General. We greatly appreciated the recognition by the international community, through the United Nations system, of the great sacrifices made by the people of Guinea to help the refugees from neighbouring countries, and especially the will of the United Nations system to mobilize resources to strengthen Guinea?s economic capacity and preserve its stability, so that we can continue to be a small island of peace and prosperity. I should like to take this opportunity to urge multilateral partners, all our partners, to continue to pursue with us the activities undertaken in support of Guinea, particularly in the area of the environment, which 16 has been seriously degraded by the long-term mass presence of refugees. The future of the water supplies of West Africa is at stake here. The Republic of Guinea is closely following recent developments in the political situation in the Great Lakes region, particularly the crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. My delegation is deeply concerned by the risk that the conflict will spill over into the subregion. We urgently appeal to all the parties to the conflict to call an immediate ceasefire and to respect the territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in accordance with the recommendations of the summit of heads of State of the subregion held at Victoria Falls on 7 and 8 September this year. Promoting the right to development is part of the overall search for greater prosperity for the human race. While tangible political progress has been made in Africa over the last decade, African States still face the challenge of development, indebtedness and the negative impact of a globalization which is not yet fully understood. This terrible situation, aggravated by the negative impact of internal conflict, is significantly weakening our States and opening them up to new and dangerous forms of foreign greed. The implementation of a policy to gradually reduce the imbalances between rich and developing countries would contribute to the emergence of a true global market by the creation of centres of development on all continents. Each country in the world should be given every opportunity for development and helped to become part of the world trade system. Despite considerable efforts by African countries towards political and economic restructuring, and towards strengthening their credibility and making their economies more competitive, the economic situation in Africa continues to be critical. If urgent and appropriate measures are not taken, the sacrifices made risk having been in vain. My Government has already undertaken far-reaching political, economic and structural reforms and hopes that special attention will be given to the situation in Africa. We appeal to the international community and the developed countries to continue to increase official development assistance. Sustained assistance to African countries will enable them to consolidate what they have already achieved and thereby to enter the next millennium with a greater sense of calm. In this respect, the Agenda for Development should be strongly supported, with a view to its effective implementation. The question of disarmament and the non- proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is still a concern for my Government. While the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was a significant step forward for the preservation of peace, recent developments in the international arena require the international community as a whole to consider more deeply the underlying causes of the nuclear arms race. It seems clear that as long as imbalances and injustices are not put right, the spectre of proliferation will continue to threaten international peace. Countries that already possess nuclear weapons have a special responsibility for the preservation of international peace and must shoulder their responsibilities by taking a more active part in strengthening prevention and peacekeeping mechanisms, resolving existing or latent conflicts, ensuring more equitable treatment for States involved in conflict and, finally, making a more substantial contribution to the development of less fortunate nations. The Government of Guinea believes that only general and complete disarmament can prevent the risk of proliferation. In the subregion of West Africa, the trade in small arms endangers the internal equilibrium of our States. Within the context of conflict prevention in West Africa, subregional cooperation is under way to eradicate this scourge. We invite the other regions of Africa to support this initiative and to work to establish appropriate structures in order to put an end to the illicit trade in small arms and make Africa a zone of peace and security. The Republic of Guinea welcomes the adoption and signing of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. The National Assembly of Guinea has already ratified this important Convention to show its support for the elimination of landmines, which cause so much suffering to innocent victims. It is reassuring to note the greater awareness at the global level of the need to end drug-trafficking, whose many consequences dangerously threaten the prosperity of nations. The results of the recent world summit meeting on drugs will doubtless enable us to further refine our methods to combat the production, distribution, sale and consumption of drugs, which are a real scourge. 17 The recent adoption in Rome of the Statute of the International Criminal Court was a major milestone in the progress of humankind towards the elimination of serious violations of humanitarian law committed during international or internal conflicts. As our community prepares to enter the third millennium, it is now more necessary than ever to adapt the United Nations to the requirements of international life. The new challenges facing us will require the adoption of new, more appropriate arrangements to make the twenty-first century one of peace, justice and prosperity within the context of an equitable partnership that is beneficial to all nations. My delegation is convinced that the United Nations is still the melting pot in which all nations can make their voices heard in the search for just and lasting solutions to their concerns. We therefore believe that the financial capacity of the United Nations must be strengthened. Contributions must be paid on time and in accordance with the established scale. To that end, we must, together, review the way in which the United Nations system functions with a view to adapting it to current and future circumstances. My delegation believes in the need for the democratization of the United Nations through the restructuring of its principal bodies, such as the Security Council, whose current membership reflects the state of the world in 1945 and no longer corresponds to the political, economic and social realities of the world today. The reform of the principal bodies of our Organization must enable all States to use their national capacities to seek and consolidate international peace. My country is more committed than ever to the honourable mission of our Organization as set forth in the Charter. Given the many challenges facing us, Guinea believes in the need for all of us to work together to strengthen and preserve humankind?s vision of justice, freedom, peace and solidarity. That is what our peoples would have us do.   Allow me first of all, Sir, to convey, on behalf of my delegation, my warmest and most heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Opertti on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. His election is a tribute to his country, Uruguay, a country with which Cameroon shares many common ideals. It is also a mark of our confidence in his qualities as a diplomat and lawyer of renown. He can rest assured of the full cooperation of the delegation of Cameroon in successfully discharging his important duty. I also pay a warm tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, who discharged with effectiveness and authority the delicate and high-profile mission with which he was entrusted. Finally, I renew the firm support of my country, Cameroon, for the work undertaken by the Secretary- General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, at the head of the Secretariat of our Organization since his election. He has resolutely and effectively tackled the reform of the United Nations with discretion, tact and realism, so as to make it capable of meeting the challenges facing it. At a time of globalization and information superhighways, it is more urgent and necessary than ever to place the development and dignity of humankind at the centre of our concerns. We must also acknowledge that the tremendous technological advances at the end of this century justify high hopes of a better tomorrow. By working for the right to development for both present and future generations, by charting new and more secure paths in the quest for peace, by watching over international security more effectively than in the past, our Organization is, at this delicate period in history, helping to ease the anguish of humankind in an international environment that is increasingly complex, unequal and disquieting. In this context, the current session of the General Assembly gains greater prominence and importance because it coincides with two fiftieth anniversaries: that of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and that of 9 the start of peacekeeping operations. Those two events will form the basis of my remarks. With regard to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the first words of the preamble retain, 50 years later, striking relevance. It states: “recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world”. Human rights are, first and foremost, a question of dignity: dignity for every human being; dignity for all of humankind. We believe that this search for dignity, which is a condition for peace, justice and freedom in the world, is the common ideal towards which all human rights actions and activities should be aimed. The commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary is a true rallying call to us and should provide the international community with an opportunity to refocus its approach to human rights questions, which remains very simplistic. Indeed, too often we forget that civil and political rights, which exercise the international community so much, can be fully developed only if economic, social and cultural rights are also guaranteed. Recent experiences of democratization processes in Africa remind us, by their very fragility, of the incontrovertible indivisibility, universality and interdependence of human rights. To paraphrase the words the head of State of Cameroon, His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, spoke at the World Food Summit in Rome, what dignity can there be for the hungry? The international community must therefore give equal priority to the promotion of the right to a minimum standard of living. In a world in which the globalization of trade, instead of placing human beings at the centre of its concerns, merely means speculation, market manipulation and deals that generate the greatest profits, making the rich richer and reducing the poorest to destitution, the social environment itself is the cause of tension and conflict. That is why we congratulate the Secretary-General on his report (A/52/871), submitted to the Security Council as document S/1998/318 on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa. In this context, it is apt that, in seeking to establish a true culture of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the international community has chosen the central theme of the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary to be “human rights for all”. Poverty is today the most serious threat to human dignity. This is particularly true in Africa, which is the least advanced region and the one most seriously affected by the economic crisis. Despite the reforms that have taken place, at enormous social cost, to promote good governance, democracy and the liberalization of economies, meeting basic needs remains for many a luxury in that continent. Whether we are talking about access to drinking water, primary health care, or education or about transport or other communication infrastructures, international cooperation has not yet borne fruit in a reliable, continuing, predictable and effective way. Official development assistance, which elsewhere has helped to give rise to decent standards of living, is dwindling drastically. Despite the increasingly favourable juridical environment offered by Africa, investors seem to be losing interest in the region. The debt burden is getting worse. Our products do not have easy access to international markets, nor are they priced according to their true value. It is clear that the marginalization of Africa seems inevitable unless a true spirit of solidarity quickly provides real long-term solutions. It is time for the various initiatives, plans of action and other programmes adopted to benefit Africa to be translated into reality. Basing itself on the efforts made by the peoples of Africa, the international community must increase its assistance to that continent so as to enable Africans themselves to make the progress that is indispensable for developing their potential. In that way African countries will be able successfully to integrate themselves into world economic networks and achieve the development to which they legitimately aspire, despite the well-known geographical and historical handicaps. Such a development would inevitably benefit all of humankind. This solidarity should take the specific form of reconsideration — indeed, the cancelling — of the debts of African countries. We should recall that decisions to cancel debt in the past have enabled countries in difficult and precarious situations to rediscover the road to economic prosperity, democracy and greater political stability. The path thus seems clearly laid out for the rich countries that are working to promote freedom and human 10 rights. They should reflect, at the dawn of the third millennium, on their relations with developing countries that are becoming poorer because of their deep indebtedness. North-South solidarity should also be reflected in a new concept of official development assistance. Such assistance is indispensable for establishing development infrastructure within the context of poverty eradication. Private flows, channelled through non-governmental organizations, cannot alone take on that role. Furthermore, structural adjustment should aim to strengthen and improve the autonomous management capacity of countries in difficulty. Otherwise, globalization will mean that certain countries become richer while others become poorer. That would render meaningless the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and put in grave danger the requirement of dignity for every human being, for all people and for peace in the world. Indeed, what freedom or self-determination — and especially, what sovereignty — can there be for a starving people? What democracy can there be for a people suffering from malnutrition, with no access to basic health care, drinking water or elementary education. We thus need to return the human being to the centre of development. Cameroon has constantly contributed to this lofty endeavour. The salient activities we have undertaken to mark the fiftieth anniversary in my country include informing people about human rights and making all of society aware of human rights issues through media campaigns, seminars, conferences and poster campaigns throughout our land, even in villages; the introduction of human rights teaching in schools and universities; issuing special postage stamps; promoting in particular the rights of women, children and disabled or infirm people, establishing a prize for the best research in the human rights area; and the opening by the head of State of a public square dedicated to human rights. But above and beyond commemorating the anniversary, Cameroon has for a decade been making important progress in promoting human rights. It did so first through a series of legislative and regulatory measures that, inter alia, abolished legal exemptions, restored individual and collective freedoms, put an end to censorship and ensured better protection for the interests of workers and vulnerable social sectors. Through constitutional revision and a progressive electoral system, we have established total adherence to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and ensured the full participation of our people in making political choices. Furthermore, a national committee for human rights and freedoms was established in 1990, which is freely carrying out its activities throughout the country, as are the many non-governmental organizations and human rights groups that have come into being. With regard to progress made in the world since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the efforts that remain to be made in this area, there is no doubt that the promotion of and respect for human rights are a difficult, ongoing endeavour. Vigilance must therefore be our watchword, and the struggle for human rights should not flag in any region of the world. The United Nations must continue to ensure that human rights are fully enjoyed by all the peoples of the world. To that end, the letter and spirit of the Universal Declaration should gradually be adapted to changing mores and to science and technology. Bodies that are above the fray of ideologies and interests should ensure that it is observed, including through a system of regional and international human rights courts. With regard to the fiftieth anniversary of peacekeeping operations, we wish to pay tribute to the work done by the United Nations, which has always made its presence felt wherever peace has been threatened. Thanks to the Blue Helmets, the United Nations is present in all the world’s trouble spots, keeping the peace. It is true that some voices have been heard here and there deploring their sluggishness, hesitation and, in some cases the inaction. Sometimes the presence of a United Nations force or mission has not been able to prevent large-scale massacres or crimes against humanity, perpetrated in violation of the most elementary rules of humanitarian law. Such limits to the actions of our Organization remind us in a very timely manner that the United Nations can act only within the limits of the means made available to it by the Member States. It is up to Member States, therefore, to provide it with the necessary resources to enable it to respond fully to the mission entrusted to it by the peoples of the United Nations. Despite these limits, we must acknowledge in a positive spirit that over the years many peacekeeping operations and other actions taken by the Secretary- General have made it possible to prevent the emergence, aggravation or continuation of many conflicts. 11 Thanks to the Blue Helmets, millions of human lives have been saved, and sometimes the United Nations has paid a heavy price for this total commitment to the cause of peace. The recent tragic death of Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye and his team, to whose memory I wish to reaffirm the fraternal homage of the people of Cameroon, is one more particularly unhappy example of this point. By ensuring the safety of peoples, the delivery of humanitarian aid and respect for ceasefire agreements and by performing an increasing number of administrative tasks, the Blue Helmets are helping restore confidence and prevent loss of life and the disintegration of certain States. Such commitments and sacrifices deserve all our encouragement. The fiftieth anniversary of peacekeeping operations should provide us with an opportunity to think about questions relating to their continuation: problems of financing, the safety of personnel involved in the operations, the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations and ethical issues. With regard to the ethical issues, Cameroon believes that it is time to formulate a code of conduct so that people participating in peacekeeping operations can remain, above all, protectors of human rights as well as true beneficiaries of them. Given the many tasks expected of these operations, it would be appropriate to review their range, their scope and the modalities governing them. Even now, as we congratulate the United Nations on its work for peace, conflicts are still destroying lives, tearing apart families and communities and placing at risk the future of young generations throughout the world. The reports of the Security Council and of the Secretary- General, which we receive on a regular basis, are particularly important in this respect. The resurgence of terrorism is another element of the picture, as we were recently reminded by the deadly attacks against the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es- Salaam and the attack in Omagh. Cameroon, a peaceful, justice-loving country, strongly condemns these unfortunate events that show that we need to redouble our efforts to put an end to mindless violence. This means that we must silence weapons, prevent disputes and above all create the conditions for true peace. That does not mean merely the absence of armed conflict, but living together in harmony, with the entire international community and all nations building together a society that respects individual and collective freedoms. We need to begin by recognizing and accepting differences as a source of richness and dynamism. We need to practise tolerance and dialogue, the latter not just between the citizens of one nation but also between States, in order to build a more fraternal and democratic society. This means in particular that we must opt to settle disputes through peaceful means and that States must turn whenever necessary to the International Court of Justice as the judicial organ of the United Nations and the essential cog not only in the machinery for peaceful settlement of disputes, but also within the general system of peacekeeping and international security established by the Charter. At the end of the United Nations Decade of International Law, the call has become urgent for States to demonstrate themselves psychologically prepared to seek recourse naturally to the International Court of Justice and the political bodies of the United Nations and those of regional organizations. This is Cameroon’s conviction, as well as that of the General Assembly, which in resolution 3232 (XXIX), paragraph 6, reaffirmed that, “recourse to judicial settlement of legal disputes, particularly referral to the International Court of Justice, should not be considered an unfriendly act between States.” That is why Cameroon went to the International Court of Justice at The Hague with regard to its dispute with Nigeria over territorial and maritime boundaries. In this context, I should like to take this opportunity to make an urgent appeal to the international community, and especially to the United Nations, to help keep the peace between our two countries before, during and after the Court’s verdict. Silencing weapons is a good thing; eliminating their use through prevention and — why not? — through disarmament is even better. That is why we must not rest until all weapons of mass destruction are eradicated, be they of a nuclear, chemical, biological or other nature. It must be pointed out here that another danger has appeared in certain subregions of Africa — namely, the proliferation of small arms and their illicit circulation. This phenomenon is already a threat to peace and should 12 be quickly contained because it can sow the seeds of conflict. The conclusions of the recent seminar organized by the United Nations Secretariat in Yaoundé from 27 to 31 July 1998 within the framework of the Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa are particularly illustrative in that regard. I would like to thank the Secretary-General and donor countries for their support of the activities of that Committee. We know that we can continue to count on their support in implementing the recommendations of that seminar, especially in continuing the Committee’s activities. That institution is called on to play a crucial role in mobilizing the countries of central Africa to take responsibility for the security of their subregion under the aegis of the United Nations. Also with regard to prevention, the recent creation in Rome of the International Criminal Court is a timely addition to the mechanisms that protect human rights and maintain peace. The International Criminal Court will in effect be responsible for prosecuting and punishing persons guilty of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression. Cameroon is pleased to have been one of the first signatories to its Statute and hopes that all States will become parties to it. To this end, it is urgent that the crime of aggression be rapidly and clearly defined. This would abolish the impunity of aggressors and prove to the peoples of the world our real determination to put an end to war once and for all. In the context of this general debate, I have deliberately chosen, as the Assembly has seen, not to touch on most current problems, particularly ongoing crises. I wanted to concentrate on certain permanent essential values that lie at the basis of the two observances I mentioned, whose violation causes most of the misfortune in our world today. I refer to the human persons’s right to dignity and fulfilment, the right to development and the right to peace — in short, the right to life. The United Nations is the guarantor of their observance and promotion. For Africa, the recent report of the Secretary-General, which should act as a kind of compass for all of us, lays down the foundations for all those committed to working for the prosperity of our peoples. In reality, all regions of the world need this kind of wake-up call and this kind of report. We are accountable to future generations for making these values a reality. Let us not disappoint. Let us not allow people to be left along the side of the road. It is up to us to do everything possible so that these humane values remain a constant concern of the United Nations and of its specialized agencies.  On behalf of the delegation of Guinea-Bissau, I am pleased to extend our congratulations to you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. I am particularly pleased because it is unanimously agreed that you have exceptional intellectual, political and diplomatic qualities which will ensure the success of our deliberations. It also gives me pleasure to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, and to thank him for his dynamism and initiative and for the integrity which he displayed throughout his mandate. I wish to reiterate to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, our appreciation for the tangible results we have seen in the Organization since his election, and to encourage him to persevere with the same determination in implementing his reform programme, which we wholeheartedly support. As we prepare to enter the new millennium, it is important to be aware of the increasing interdependence of nations, large and small, and of the consequences of globalization, so that through fruitful dialogue at the global level, we may together find appropriate responses to the numerous challenges facing us, particularly the fight against international terrorism. Poverty, underdevelopment and the major pandemics must not remain the sole responsibility of the countries affected by these scourges, because for tomorrow’s world to be stable it must be united founded on the principles of social justice and the equality of peoples and nations. Hence, the primacy of law must continue to guide us in seeking lasting solutions to the numerous regrettable conflicts throughout the world. We are pleased to note that all the peoples of the world share a determination to live in peace, within their national borders, with their neighbours and the rest of the international community. My country welcomes the positive developments in the Lockerbie affair, which has been a matter of concern to us for many years. It has been the subject of decisions by regional organizations, such as the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the League of Arab States, as well as the Non-Aligned Movement. We hope that the parties involved will spare no effort to ensure that justice is done in conditions of fairness and impartiality, with all the necessary guarantees, taking into account the recognized rights of each party. We feel that the clarifications called for by the Libyan authorities are legitimate, because they are based on the objective criteria of neutrality and fair play which govern any judicial procedure worthy of the name. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau was admitted as a fully fledged member of the United Nations in September 1974, following a lengthy and difficult struggle for national liberation. For almost a quarter of a century we have been committed to respecting and defending the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter, because they are essential guidelines for active participation in international life and for the building of our young nation. Early on we understood that in order to give shape to our political independence we needed to establish the conditions for harmonious economic development from which all sections of our population could benefit. With the assistance of the international community, therefore, our young State focused on ways and means to build a land of freedom and peace. It goes without saying that 11 years of struggle for national liberation scarred our people and left an indelible mark on their minds and bodies. Since Guinea-Bissau is a poor country with very limited resources, everything needed to be built, despite the fact that we did not have the financial means or the necessary skills. Therefore, inspired by the courage that enabled us to galvanize ourselves to free our country, we set to the task determined to create the right conditions for the full development of our citizens and the improvement of their living standards. Over the past four years we have succeeded in laying the foundations of a democratic State based on the rule of law and respect for human rights. As members of the Assembly know, building a nation is a long-term task requiring both determination and perseverance. Guinea- Bissau, which is among the poorest countries of the world, is no exception to that rule. Over the past two decades we have focused on consolidating our national unity by strengthening the ties of solidarity that unite our citizens, whose maturity had enabled them to wage, and succeed in, one of the most exemplary national liberation struggles in Africa. It is precisely this awareness of belonging to the same people that has enabled all sectors of our population to unite and work hand in hand for the development of the country and the well-being of all. Therefore, since its independence in 1973, despite the economic difficulties all States face, Guinea-Bissau has lived in peace and has known a period of great political stability. However, since 7 June our country has experienced tragedy, previously unimaginable, just when it was beginning to make notable progress with regard to democracy and respect for human rights and in the economy. An unprecedented crisis for which we were not even minimally prepared has deeply shaken and paralysed our country for some four months now, endangering the foundations of the state of law and the existence of democratic institutions in the Republic. The act of aggression by a party of our country’s national army is a serious violation of the constitutional provisions in force in Guinea-Bissau. The international community, in particular the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations, have unreservedly condemned this act of aggression. From this podium, we wish to thank the United Nations family for the solidarity and support it has provided to the President of the Republic, Mr. João Bernardo Vieira; the legal Government of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau; its leaders; and especially, the innocent, victimized population. I should like in particular to convey our gratitude to the neighbouring countries of Guinea-Bissau for their active solidarity with our people. On behalf of my Government, I specifically thank the authorities of Senegal, Guinea, Cape Verde, the Gambia and Portugal for having rapidly created an appropriate rapid-response team to evacuate citizens and foreign nationals who wished to leave, especially our own desperate compatriots, a great number of whom have sought refuge and safe haven in neighbouring countries. Each of these brother countries has distinguished itself admirably in an exemplary display of compassion and 2 humanity. I wish to thank them most sincerely on behalf of our Government and all of my compatriots. I also wish to pay tribute to the courage of my own fellow citizens and to reiterate, on behalf of our Government, our keen awareness of the difficulties they face and of the need to ease their suffering by finding a speedy solution to the current crisis, so that peace and stability may be restored to our homeland, and by establishing conditions to allow our people to return to their country. It is its desire to find a peaceful and negotiated solution to this crisis that has inspired the Government of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau in its contacts with the members of the self-proclaimed military junta. Indeed, through the joint mediation of members of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries and the Economic Community of West African States, we have signed a ceasefire and begun a constructive dialogue, which we will pursue on the basis of recognition and respect for the constitutional legality of our country and the need to work together to restore peace and stability. We are grateful to all people of goodwill who have come forward, both in Africa and overseas, to assist us in overcoming all of these difficulties and in finding a final solution to the conflict in Guinea-Bissau. The people of Guinea-Bissau are peaceful. They have age-old relations of friendship and brotherhood with their neighbours in the Republics of Guinea, Senegal and the Gambia. These relations are based on the common destiny which history and geography have bequeathed us. It is a precious legacy that present and future generations must preserve and defend in the conviction that their identity and their social and cultural values will endure. It is this same committed and unfailing solidarity which enabled us to free ourselves from the yoke of colonialism, as did our brothers in Guinea and Senegal. As we have already had the opportunity to point out, the presence of Guinean and Senegalese troops in Guinea- Bissau is based on the implementation of bilateral agreements duly signed and ratified. In addition to the existence of an unquestionably legal framework, however, it is important to know and recall that, through their intervention, the Guinean and Senegalese troops bravely assisted their comrades in arms in Guinea to overcome an attempted coup that has been condemned by the OAU, the United Nations and the entire international community. They have made a courageous contribution to the maintenance of constitutional legality and democracy in Guinea-Bissau. Allow me here to pay tribute to them for their decisive action and to offer them our full gratitude. For some four months, Guinea-Bissau has been experiencing a major tragedy that has brought great loss of human life, serious material damage and much suffering to our people, who have been internally displaced and made refugees in neighbouring countries, Cape Verde and Portugal. Once again, I wish to thank the Assembly for its solidarity with our country and people. Its assistance is valued and will be valuable in healing the wounds and assisting all the citizens of our country to understand each other better and work together for the common future of their homeland. I can assure members that we will spare no effort to ensure that, through dialogue and joint endeavours, peace will return to a Guinea-Bissau united and reconciled in solidarity. More than ever, we recognize the need to establish a pluralistic democracy in a state of law and an egalitarian society that will guarantee full respect for civil, political and human rights. Today more than ever, we are aware of the importance of peace in our country and in other conflicted regions of the world where peoples of the same country have been torn apart. I am thinking in particular of the fratricidal wars which for some years now have ravaged other African countries, Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in particular. At a time when we are preparing to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it is appropriate to proclaim our complete commitment to the fundamental principles of democracy, good governance and respect for human rights, which underpin our search for harmonious development and a better standard of living. The international community, the United Nations in particular, has always heeded the aspirations of the people of Guinea-Bissau. With its solidarity, it has made our struggle for national liberation its own battle for the emancipation of peoples throughout the world. Today, as in the past, we need its support to rebuild our country and restore confidence and hope to our compatriots, who impatiently await the moment when they can return to their country, their homes, their families, their friends and their workplaces — to peace and stability.At the outset, we wish to express our heartfelt condolences and solidarity to the peoples of the Caribbean because of the suffering being experienced today in places such as Saint Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, St. Maarten, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic due to Hurricane Georges, which has hit the region. The delegation I am honoured to represent joins in the congratulations extended to Mr. Opertti on his election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. This constitutes a recognition not only of his outstanding ability and merits, but also of the brotherly country of Uruguay, whose well-known international calling makes it an outstanding Member and representative of Latin America in this important international body. We are also grateful to his illustrious predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his efforts to contribute to the Organizationâs modernization. At the end of June, during the absence of the President of the General Assembly, Panama, as Vice- President, occupied the presidency of the General Assembly and had the honour of cooperating in the adoption of important measures on science, technology and computers. Our gratitude goes also to the seventh Secretary- General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who, with the long experience he has gained over more than 30 years devoted to the Organization, is promoting reforms that will be of great benefit to the United Nations. 18 On Security Council reform, we endorse the recommendation of the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters Related to the Security Council that consideration of this item should continue during the fifty-third session of the General Assembly on the basis of the work carried out in previous sessions. Panama recalls with gratitude that the holding of a Security Council meeting in Panama a quarter of a century ago and the support of the international community were extremely valuable to the Panamanian people in the fulfilment of its aspirations regarding the Canal. Panama attaches great importance to discussions relating to economic issues, particularly those addressing sustainable economic development in order to eradicate poverty. We feel that by improving our education, our countries will better be able to focus on processes of reform, which must be undertaken gradually. With regard to the globalization of the economy, the Republic of Panama congratulates the Secretary-General for having held on the 17 and 18 September a high-level dialogue on the social and economic impact of globalization and the interdependence of its political consequences. Panama feels that the matters before the Fifth Committee relating to the process of adopting the budget are of great importance to the Organization, and we hope that Member States will faithfully comply with its suggestions. My delegation believes that we should give full support to measures that will persuade Member States to pay on time and in full their obligations to the United Nations. In our judgment, the most important tasks to be accomplished in order to neutralize the present economic crisis are the restoration of trust in the markets; the stabilization of the financial markets; the support of growth; allocation of the necessary means to the international financial institutions; and the immediate protection of the most vulnerable. The financial markets and their problems are of global scope, yet the governmental efforts to resolve those problems have a strictly local range. This disparity is at the root of many problems we are now facing. Economic globalization makes it necessary to strengthen the links of the United Nations with the World Bank, the World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Childrenâs Fund (UNICEF) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). The need to create an even playing field in the international system for economic cooperation is urgent and justifies the major efforts ongoing within the United Nations to restructure what has been called the â€œarchitectureâ€ of the system. We support the Secretary-Generalâs repeated calls for more vigorous action towards some way of alleviating the enormous debts that are suffocating many countries and that they simply cannot carry. It seems to us that economic, social and environmental policy dimensions must be integrated in such a way that none of them is sacrificed for the sake of the others. We were deeply impressed by the wise counsel on poverty given to us yesterday by President Mandela. We urge the Secretary-General and the community of the United Nations to continue our efforts to ensure that the obvious benefits of globalization and its resultant interdependence do not serve to make the rich richer and the poor poorer. This could be done by establishing mechanisms that redirect part of the wealth generated to the praiseworthy goals of creating more hospitals, more modern schools and a higher standard of living for all people. Panama has contributed to the cause of sustainable economic development by complying with Agenda 21 and the mandates of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. The concrete result of this was the adoption of Law 41 of July 1998, an overall environmental law for the Republic of Panama, which establishes the basic principles and regulations for protecting, preserving and restoring the environment. Another result is the preparation of an environmental strategy for the country within the framework of a process in which the whole of Panamanian society is participating; actions are concerted, and each sector is committed to holding up its end. We must have a clear vision of the future where anything related to the environment is concerned, and we 19 are sure that the Secretary-General will also make this clear in his plans for the future. Panama has followed with great interest the events relating to peace in the Middle East and the problems of the war-torn former Yugoslavia. We support the comprehensive policy that must be pursued in Africa in order to move beyond the causes of conflict and promote lasting peace and sustainable development in the region. Similarly, we have followed with great interest the Secretary-Generalâs efforts to advance the negotiations towards just and lasting peace in Cyprus so that the unification process can quickly be consolidated. We see serious dangers in the situation in Afghanistan. At the Conference in Rome, my country agreed with all that was said in favour of the establishment of an International Criminal Court, and we are prepared, along with other Member States in the General Assembly, to make every effort necessary so that this court can bring to justice those who have committed serious crimes that are of concern to the international community. As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we recall with respect and admiration the work carried out by the great Panamanian internationalist Mr. Ricardo J. Alfaro, who was instrumental in the drafting of this document that is so important to humanity. We will always be attentive to the need for United Nations programmes and policies to express the concern we feel over the violations of human rights that still occur in certain places. With the establishment of its Ministry for Youth, Women, Children and the Family, the Republic of Panama has taken a very active part in protecting the rights of children in the workplace and is vigorously combating all aspects of prostitution and child pornography. We therefore applaud the work being carried out by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, and we note with great satisfaction the effective work being done in this area by the Office of the First Lady of Panama. We noted with concern the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan, and condemned them at the time, since they run counter to the principles of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. At the same time, we would like to see implemented all the agreements included in the chemical and biological weapons conventions. Panama continues to take an interest in the ban on anti-personnel landmines, and we are ever vigilant to ensure that our territory is free of these extremely dangerous mines. The recent acts of terrorism in Africa and Europe are serious and unjustifiable crimes. They show clearly the need to further strengthen the legal and political framework to combat this scourge. We share the concerns expressed here yesterday regarding the dangers of terrorism. As we stated at the recent Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Rio Group, which was held in our country, we reaffirm the importance of strengthening cooperation to combat terrorism at both the bilateral and multilateral levels, with full respect for the sovereignty and jurisdiction of each State. Internationally, we reiterate our commitment to and support for efforts by the international community to combat terrorism, since terrorist activities, whatever their purpose and motivation, are, in addition to being a violation of human rights, immoral criminal acts, extreme acts of fanaticism that attack freedom, human life and the development of peoples. Regarding drug-trafficking, we are convinced that the most effective way to make progress in combating drugs would be to see it as a multilateral problem, always bearing in mind respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each country. Panama therefore firmly supports the tasks and commitments established at the twentieth special session of the General Assembly, which was devoted to the common struggle against the world drug problem, as well as the principles and responsibilities established by the Organization of American States in this matter. From 4 to 6 September, just a few days ago, a meeting of the heads of State and Government of the Rio Group was held in Panama, this yearâs Secretariat of the Rio Group, a consultative body for political harmony comprising 14 Latin American countries. The Latin American community is increasingly convinced that with solid cooperation resulting from political consensus of the Rio Group member States we can make greater strides at both the national and international levels. Through the annual meetings of the heads of State and Government and the Foreign Ministers of the region we have established common objectives and 20 commitments, which cover strengthening our democracies, questions of international peace and security, drug- trafficking, terrorism, human rights, combating poverty, sustainable development and international trade, as well as new issues, such as the year 2000 computer problem and the international financial crisis. At the Rio Group meeting held in Quito in 1995, the Republic of Panama offered its territory as the headquarters for a forum where countries of the region could join in considering policies and measures aimed to eradicate trafficking in narcotics and other illicit substances, as well as in coordinating anti-drug measures and training programmes, which effectively support our efforts to combat drug-trafficking in the region. The Universal Congress on the Panama Canal, meeting in our capital from 7 to 10 September 1997, clearly showed the need for contact with the international maritime community, the users and clients of the Canal, and considered creating an advisory board of the Canal Authority, in order to make use of the experience and wisdom of men and women throughout the world. We reiterate our pledge that the Panama Canal will always be a public service, international in character and efficient and safe, without any form of discrimination. We are ready to assume full management of the Panama Canal on 31 December 1999, thus consolidating our territory under a single flag. This is an appropriate occasion to reaffirm to the international community that after 31 December 1999 Panama will never again renounce control of the Canal, which is in our territory; it will be a symbol of the aspirations of many generations of Panamanians who have wanted this Canal to be an integral part of our territory in a free, independent and sovereign nation. In conclusion, I believe it is fitting to recall here the following words of the President of Panama, Dr. Ernesto PÃ©rez Balladares, to our Legislative Assembly on 1 September: â€œI wish to reiterate once again my commitment to democracy and my commitment to prepare for the transfer of the Canal without exclusions and without political sectarianism. The elections on 2 May 1999 will determine who will lead the country into the twenty-first century and who will close once and for all this historic era for our territory. For my part, I am certain that on 1 September 1999 there will be a President and a Legislative Assembly elected through transparent and democratic elections; that our nation is now prepared to assume full control of the Canal and its adjacent areas; and that, above all, the country will be reconciled, in peace and prepared to enter the next millennium without the presence of foreign military bases and with a modern, prosperous economy.â€  The Dominican Republic wishes to express its gratitude for the gestures of solidarity expressed by friendly countries with regard to the passage of the terrible hurricane, Georges, which struck our country yesterday. Furthermore, we appeal to the generosity of the international community to provide cooperation with a view to facing both the immediate emergencies of the population affected by this phenomenon and the process of national recovery. The delegation of the Dominican Republic, on behalf of the Government presided over by Mr. Leonel Fernández, wishes to extend its warmest congratulations to the President of the General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay, on his well-deserved election to preside over the fifty-third session, which is taking place at a time of great structural changes in global society and within our Organization. We also wish to thank Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, who presided over the deliberations of the last session of the General Assembly with such skill. Our gratitude goes also to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his devotion and efforts to guide the Organization along the path towards modernization and reform, which will strengthen us as we reach the new millennium. The changes in the realities of the world in which we live make it necessary to revise international policy. In this respect, the United Nations, being the universal forum, must be strengthened and renewed by increasing its activities in areas such as peace and security of nations, the protection of human rights and the environment and cooperation for socio-economic and cultural development. Faithful to its principles, the United Nations must continue to encourage and deepen its programme of reforms, taking into consideration not only the complexity of the current reality, but also the future development of regulations aimed at relieving social marginalization and ethnic and religious tensions, which jeopardize the priority objectives of peace and development for our peoples. The Dominican Republic expresses its firm support for the negotiations and consultations on the programme of reform. We trust that the process will culminate in substantial changes in the various organs of the United Nations, enhancing their effectiveness and leading to a more democratic, transparent and representative Organization, thus ensuring its ability to act to achieve its present objectives. Fortunately, the constant threat of a nuclear war has diminished. Today, however, we are faced with the challenge of combating together, and on a global scale, hunger, poverty, environmental destruction and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and encourage equitable development and free societies. We must also struggle to lay the bases of economic growth. There are other security problems that require decisive action: international terrorism, organized crime and illicit trafficking in arms and drugs. We must create reliable instruments to put an end to these evils and achieve acceptable levels of security for our citizens so that they can live in peace. The politics of security is inspired by the vision of a democratic world that practices solidarity. Security must be achieved on the basis of political, economic, social and ecological cooperation. The principle of sovereign equality of States and the belief that conflicts of interest must be resolved peacefully require global cooperation because security can be achieved only with the participation of all States. 41 That task falls principally to the Security Council. The Dominican Republic believes it necessary to enlarge the Council by creating new seats for the regions of Latin America, Asia and Africa, thus strengthening it in the fulfilment of its functions and allowing for greater representativity. The Dominican Republic believes that international peace and stability are prerequisites for a secure future for mankind. Democracy and respect for human rights, together with justice and respect for the law, are the surest ways of preserving peace. General acceptance of these principles cannot be imposed, but it can be actively promoted. The crisis spots that afflict large segments of the world?s population continue to be of concern to many States. We emphasize the need to strengthen mechanisms of dialogue and negotiation in conflict areas such as the Balkans, the Middle East and the Great Lakes region in Africa. With regard to the Republic of China on Taiwan, the Dominican Republic reiterates the positions presented by its President, Mr. Leonel Fernández, with regard to the need for the international community to consider the importance of that country, due to its geographic location, for the peace, security and prosperity of that region. We favour constructive dialogue between both sides of the Taiwan Strait to bring about understanding and mutual cooperation. We reiterate that the parallel participation of both countries in the United Nations would be conducive to the maintenance of peace. The Dominican Republic is also committed to the process of nuclear disarmament and vigorously protests the recent nuclear tests, as these can endanger world peace. We reaffirm the need for strict respect for international treaties on the prohibition, emplacement and testing of nuclear weapons, in the atmosphere, in the oceanic subsoil and on the ocean floor. We urge nuclear-weapon States to use and handle those weapons responsibly as the only protection for those of us who do not have that type of defence. The preservation of world peace demands that Member States of the United Nations establish new nuclear-weapon-free zones and protect those already existing as a guarantee of security. Concern for the preservation of a zone free of nuclear contamination is shared by the nations of the Caribbean, which is used as a transportation route for toxic and nuclear wastes. For those countries among us that depend largely on tourism based on sun and beaches, the coastal water quality is vital to that important sector of our economies. Ongoing trafficking in illicit arms represents another threat to security. The arms build-up must definitively be stopped. The relevant international conventions signed by the Dominican Republic are very important, such as the one on illicit trafficking in conventional weapons. Peaceful settlement of conflicts by means of dialogue and accord is the best method to eliminate the use of force in political relations within and among Member countries. For that reason, it is necessary to enhance the efforts and mechanisms recognized by international law in order to resolve international conflicts. In that context, the Dominican Republic accepts and defends multilateralism as the appropriate way of achieving consensus on the main problems that afflict the world population. Poverty, drug-trafficking, terrorism, inter-ethnic and territorial conflicts are problems that must not be dealt with unilaterally. For that reason we support the strengthening of established international systems of justice. The signing of the Statute of the International Criminal Court is urgently needed to achieve these ends. We believe that the instruments to protect peace must be used before conflicts occur. The United Nations must take preventive action and respond rapidly and effectively to avoid later consequences. In that respect, the Convention on the elimination of anti-personnel landmines, signed by many Member States of the United Nations at Ottowa, Canada, constitutes an important step and commitment towards the consolidation of mechanisms for world peace. Firmly based on the principle of encouraging the peaceful resolution of disputes and the search for peace and security in our region, the Dominican Republic has promoted the strengthening of its neighbourly relations. For the first time in more than half a century, a Dominican President visited the Republic of Haiti. That event and the agreements reached favour the efforts undertaken by the democratic Governments of both States through dialogue and accord, which is the best way to approach their common problems. It is in this new context of our bilateral relations that we wish to appeal to the international community to continue to provide support to Haiti. The need that brought about the commitment of the United Nations to the recovery of our neighbouring country still remains. The Dominican Republic has met the challenges of world changes at the end of this century. The restoration of diplomatic relations with the fraternal country of Cuba 42 constituted an inevitable step that formalized our long- lasting relations with Cuba. Our country seeks inclusion in the integrationist trend in our geographic and geopolitical area. Thus, this year we signed two free-trade treaties, one with the five countries of Central America, and the other with the 14 members of the Caribbean Community. Both agreements are modern, advanced and comprehensive, as they deal with trade in goods and services and with investment and are in keeping with the principles of the World Trade Organization. They are conducive to economic growth, the creation of more and better jobs and improvement in the quality of life of our citizens. Other clear signs of this regional rapprochement and participation are the two presidential events held in our country. In November 1997 the city of Santo Domingo was the site of the extraordinary summit of heads of State of the Central American countries, including Belize, as well as of the Dominican Republic, and more recently, in August of this year, of the extraordinary meeting of heads of State and Government of the Caribbean Forum. Both meetings led to agreements and concrete positions regarding hemispheric and global challenges that our region must confront. At the same time, we have tightened our economic, political and development ties with the other nations of our region, through the presence of our President, Mr. Leonel Fernández, at the Summit of the Americas and the Ibero- American Summit through bilateral visits and exchanges at the presidential level with the United States, Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, countries with which we traditionally share close bonds. These regular presidential exchanges have led to consensus on basic topics on the international agenda and have deepened our levels of cooperation. Allow me now to speak out the values of democracy from a basically social approach, since people are the true and ultimate raison d?être of democracy. Human rights and fundamental freedoms will be fully respected and guaranteed only when each citizen has a reasonable life expectancy with access to health systems and the opportunity for education in a healthy ecological environment. As is well known, in order to achieve these objectives, large public expenditures in these areas are necessary. Two factors make this difficult: the external debt, a heavy burden which has dragged us down since the 1980s, and the current financial crisis, which affects various countries of the world, including some in Latin America. Both factors drain away resources that could have financed social development in this part of the world. The consequences are obvious. Unable to improve the living conditions of our people and help them become integrated into the global economy, poverty grows and democracy and stability are weakened. The greatest problem facing the international community is how to deal with the enormous economic and social imbalance from which most Member States suffer, with the gap between the rich and the poor countries and with the growth in global poverty. The role of the United Nations should be strengthened in formulating and coordinating policies for cooperation and in providing technical and financial assistance to developing countries. Human resources must take priority during the current transformation of the international, political and economic order. Women in particular must play an important role, as they constitute a dedicated, responsible and active workforce and give us reasons to see humankind as being at the centre of development and progress. The Dominican Republic understands that strengthening the role of women in the political, social and economic life of Member States is essential if we are to reduce poverty and social inequality and promote democracy and sustainable development. That is why it is essential to give priority to policies and programmes that broaden women?s participation in these areas. We vigorously support the objectives and work of the United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW). The plans to improve the contribution of women to the development of their countries, in accordance with their own needs, set up when INSTRAW was created, continues to be of primary importance and deserves continued support from Member States. Creating a new international order is a political challenge. The conditions for this new order require the multilateral system to guarantee security and governability within the framework of respect for human rights. In celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which has been a guiding light for building a more just world, we hope that respect for human rights will become daily practice for all people. 43 In conclusion, we believe that the United Nations must reflect on and accept the changes that are necessary for our Organization. That is why we enthusiastically support the reform programme, which will hope will respond to the expectations of a United Nations in tune with our time.    I am pleased and honoured to convey a cordial and respectful greeting from the people and Government of the Republic of Honduras and from the other countries that are members of the Central American Integration System, of which I am proud to be the current Chairman. Mr. President, Central America wishes to express its satisfaction at your well-deserved election to preside over this fifty-third regular session of the General Assembly. Your outstanding professional and public career is a guarantee that this session of the Assembly will yield fruitful and significant results. Our delegation wishes also to express its gratitude to the representative of the Ukraine, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for the commendable work he did during the last General Assembly. We also express our sincerest gratitude to Mr. Kofi Annan, who, in discharging his mandate as Secretary- General of our Organization, has displayed a spirit of hard work and dedication in a particularly difficult period for the United Nations. Throughout its history, Honduras has fought for the system of democratic government to take root on its soil. It has fought to take its place in the world community as a fully fledged State, to imbue its independent, republican character with respect for basic human rights, and to ensure public freedoms for all of its inhabitants. However, many of those efforts were frustrated at certain regrettable times in our past, a past that was closely interlinked with that of the other States of the Central American region. Fortunately, in recent decades Honduras has safeguarded and strengthened its democracy and its internal institutions, in spite of the deplorable and difficult circumstances experienced by the Central American region as the involuntary theatre of the cold war, which was imposed on us from outside, and in spite of the undesirable consequences of armed conflicts. The Governments of Central America are currently working hard to consolidate peace and a spirit of internal reconciliation in our societies. Our resolve is strong in this process, and the progress achieved is truly encouraging and a just reward for these efforts. We are determined to turn away forever from the fratricidal battles that have caused us so much suffering and diverted our energy from the construction of the prosperous, democratic, free and happy region that our peoples yearn for and that their democratic Governments strive to offer. It must be said that although Honduras was not the direct scene of Central American armed conflicts, it did suffer the grave consequences of the instability, uncertainty and violence of the region, which caused thousands of Hondurans to emigrate to other countries, mainly to the United States. Unfortunately, justice has not been done to our compatriots, as they have not been given the same opportunities and immigration status enjoyed by other Central Americans. We trust that the sacrifice of Honduras in the Central American conflicts of the past will be fully understood and that our emigrants will be given the consideration that they justly deserve. Furthermore, the Presidents of Central America, in ongoing consultations and regular meetings, are giving strong impetus to regional integration in all fields: economic, political, social and cultural. These dynamics of integration include the States of Belize, Panama and the Dominican Republic, through broad participation mechanisms and the signing of economic treaties and of bilateral and multinational exchanges. We are hoping also for a joint venture with the Mexican Republic, and we maintain that the region as a whole must enjoy the same benefits that the three principal North American countries have already agreed upon for themselves. The Government of Honduras commends the Secretary-General of the United Nations and fully supports his efforts to reform the Organization. There is consensus in Central America on the fact that United Nations reform, including broader membership of the Security Council, is a necessity for the international system. But this expansion must be based upon equitable geographic representation and the consensus of the regional groups and the existing subregional mechanisms. The restructuring must also include a procedural review in order to ensure greater representation, transparency and efficiency. The Government of Honduras supports the initiative of the President of the United States to establish a worldwide organization to fight against terrorism. We strongly condemn all types of terrorism without exception because we believe it is a form of human cruelty that no political, ideological, religious or cultural cause can justify at this stage of our civilization. 6 On the subject of controlling illegal drug trafficking, our Government reiterates its support for the special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem. Because of its strategic geographic position, Central America is in danger of becoming a production and trade area for narcotic drugs and must therefore receive the greatest possible international support to fight this scourge. We are pleased also at the advances achieved by the Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court, held in Rome, whose goal was to create a legal forum with global jurisdiction in order to bring to trial and convict individuals for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Honduran people themselves have suffered from the use of anti-personnel mines, which have taken a high toll in human lives. Consequently, we are prepared to support the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. The Government of Honduras is proud to announce that today it has deposited with the Secretary-General its instrument of ratification of the landmines Convention. The countries of the Central American Region view with concern and deplore the recent nuclear tests conducted in other geographical regions, and we advocate the introduction and full implementation of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as an important step towards the total elimination of these devastating weapons. Honduras supports the efforts of the Republic of China on Taiwan for full membership in the United Nations and in the international agencies of the United Nations system. We are convinced that conditions have changed significantly and that at this time in our history there can be no justification for the international isolation to which more than 21 million people are subjected. Among other noteworthy issues is the advancement of women in society. We welcome this advancement not only because women have the right to equality, but also because with their help we can envision a fairer and more humane world. We invite States to support the Platform for Action in the effective implementation of the Fourth World Conference on Women. Likewise, because children and adolescents are the most vulnerable members of society, we are prepared to lend our vigorous support to the convening of a world conference of ministers responsible for youth, with a view to the implementation of national programmes and of the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond, and in order to support the institutions and programmes designed to safeguard our children and young people as the generational and spiritual reserve of our homeland. Globalization is a subject of particular concern that must be tackled in this unique forum — so vital to humankind — because it gives rise to challenges of an unprecedented magnitude. It is true that humankind has always faced singular challenges throughout the millennium that is now drawing to a close. Major worldwide events have occurred that have drastically changed the way of life of millions of people: the Christian revolution, in the spiritual realm; the liberal revolutions of France and the United States, in the political realm; the Industrial Revolution, in the economic realm; and the Russian Revolution, in the social realm. Each of these historic events affected in a different way humankind?s self-image and the role of States in governing society. Thus, the twentieth century — which saw great achievements, serious errors, titanic efforts, enormous upheavals and profuse bloodshed — is now drawing to a close. We are about to open a new chapter for humankind, one that is replete with uncertainty, expectations, fears and hopes — the first century of the approaching third millennium. The twentieth century will bequeath to future generations a legacy without parallel or comparison in the history of human development. This is the century that took us to the very depth of the microcosmos through the splitting of the atom and the deciphering of the genetic code, allowing us to unravel the components of matter and discover and use an impressive number of new and even-made elements with the help of innovative formulas for nuclear energy, light, heat and sound. It has been a century of great discoveries in all the sciences — mathematics, physics, medicine, chemistry, optics, genetics, psychology and electronics. This is the century of the outer space and man?s daring probes and adventures of man beyond his planet. This is the century of vertiginous speeds that broke the sound barrier and of communications and transport that have, indeed, transformed the earth into a global village. It is the century of universal cybernetic information, which has connected man with his neighbour in the other 7 hemisphere, just as two friends used to talk in their back yards, separated only by a garden fence. Today, the computer performs tasks that would have taken the most cultivated and talented man centuries of work, or that he would have never been able to perform. Races and cultures have been mixed, influencing each other in an unceasing exchange of creations. There has been a massive spreading of ideas, news, customs and new developments such as man never dreamed of accomplishing in the course of his long and trying existence on earth. This is the century of geopolitical changes, as sudden as they are unimaginable, so huge that their very force left their own protagonists behind. Unfortunately, it is also a century that will be remembered with sadness, as the century of the two great worldwide slaughters and many dreadful, apparently local and centralized, wars. It is the century of thermonuclear, toxic and chemical weapons and other means of mass destruction. It is the century of merciless, senseless terrorism, and also the century of the terrible AIDS pandemic. It is the century, finally, of man?s greatest destruction of the ecology and of the purity of his environment, seriously threatening the very existence of his planet. We are concerned, and we are surely ashamed, that this century will also be remembered as the century of the direst poverty in an alarming majority of countries. We are grieved that when there is prosperity, it is concentrated among the richest, but when there is a crisis, on the other hand, its devastation is brought down on the poorest. But if there is one issue that characterizes this century and for ever marks it in the annals of the human race, it is the desire for, the necessity of and the value of freedom. Never have we fought so hard and paid such a high price for freedom, or for the lack thereof, as we have done in this century. Never have there been so many attempts to destroy freedom through systems, ideologies, regimes and wars, and never has man carried out such monumental exploits, such beautiful and heroic deeds, in the defence or pursuit of liberty, as in the last 10 decades of this millennium. The great figures that left their mark on contemporary history are those who denied freedom to their nations or achieved it gloriously, sometimes at the cost of their own lives. Thank God that we can say at this time, and in this world forum, that freedom has triumphed and will continue to establish itself in every corner of the world where it is still denied or crushed, whenever conditions show our peoples that freedom, an essential human value, is worth the trouble and that to fight for it and to keep it are important for man?s physical and spiritual well-being. Along with freedom, democracy is triumphing around the globe, but for this progress to continue to be effective and to last, so that we do not lose what we have gained and do not return to the tyrannies we defeated with so much effort and suffering, certain conditions must be fulfilled. This is the huge challenge of the next millennium: how to keep this freedom, how to extend it to the farthest corner of the planet and — the final test — how to manage it for the benefit of all humankind. It is true that, just as there are hopeful and encouraging expectations on which we must capitalize, there is also a lot of worry, and even fear, in our nations concerning these swift, radical and dizzying universal changes. The world economy has progressed and developed dramatically in the last 25 years. Economic globalization has opened up opportunities and risks for all the countries of the world. However, at this time it is quite clear that the benefits of globalization are not shared by all countries and that, in many cases, there is an increasing disparity between developed and developing countries, an inequality that produces social and political tensions in our countries and severely threatens the democratic advances for which we have paid so dearly. In the beginning of the process of global liberalization, it was maintained that the reduction in the flows of assistance for development would be far outweighed by the commercial benefits and private capital flows to our regions. The truth is that, even though we support commercial liberalization with concrete measures, our products have often been faced with various kinds of barriers that are hard to overcome. In combination, factors such as the reduction in development assistance, barriers to the export of our products, the scanty movement of private capital or its excessive concentration in certain areas, and the burden of foreign debt become formidable obstacles to the economic growth and social development of our peoples. I believe the time is ripe to evaluate what is happening at the global level in order to take measures that will prevent further deterioration of the living conditions of our population and promote a more just economic and social order. This concern is especially legitimate in the light of financial developments in recent days in certain countries of South-East Asia and Japan. Those economies and systems were held up to us as an example to follow and as a standard for what can be achieved with full economic liberalization. Russia followed that path that led to the 8 crisis affecting us today, which we all hope is temporary. All of this means that the economy is not everything, and that a setback in maintaining the welfare level of a people?s well-being because of economic and financial mechanisms can rapidly deteriorate its political and social conditions, presenting the imminent danger of moving backwards in the development of democracy and imperilling once again the precious gift of freedom, for which millions of men and women have given their lives in this century. Creating great expectations and exaggerated hopes of well-being and development is dangerous, as are the disappointments that can be felt by our peoples when the democratic system and the new economic order are incapable of giving concrete answers to the basic needs of our nations. This is the risk of backlash, the reversal of conquests and the return to instability, rivalry, mistrust and the loss of internal, and even international, peace. Under the pressure of globalization, modernization and economic adjustments, we have surely put at stake millions of the planet?s inhabitants? right to better life especially in Latin America. At stake is the national identity of countries and the identity of regions faced with an increasingly rapid process of universalization and assimilation, which is not always laudable. At stake is the vulnerability or resistance of our societies before the avalanche of influences, requirements and models imposed from the outside, behind the mask of structural adjustments and modernization. At stake is stability: we are faced with the massive development of violent, or simply rebellious, acts of the poor, the marginalized and the excluded, because they feel powerless before the walls that prevent their access to survival, work, education, health and safety, which are essential, basic rights, amply consecrated by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, whose fiftieth anniversary we Hondurans have celebrated with the greatest pleasure and with renewed hope that such principles can actually lead us to fairer, happier societies. We cannot hide the fear, shared by many of the Governments represented here, that a new economic order that is unfair, oversized and all-encompassing, and that does not take into consideration the political and social realities of each country and the processes that led us to these vertiginous changes, would destroy any possibility for the equitable development of each person and each people, to the extent that globalization generates excessive concentrations of power in large and monstrous consortiums, instead of solidarity in the enjoyment of the goods and opportunities afforded by a new, universal society. Whether we are moving towards an ideal, globalized, fraternal and peaceful world of solidarity, or towards other forms of tyranny, submission and cruelty — this is the question we must ask, all of us who have public responsibilities in Honduras and in every corner of the planet. In a world where the borders no longer divide countries, but rather swell to embrace the geographic contours of the planet, in a world in which the scope of international relations is limited only by human ambition and imagination, the question is whether we are heading for the globalization of ethics or an ethics of globalization. This question must be answered if we are to avoid the death, in the vortex of capital and market growth, of humankind?s ethical and moral values, which have been the pillars that prevent the crumbling of what we all call civilization. At issue, in short, is the ability to govern societies, but without losing the freedoms that gave birth to States, and without losing the ethical values that have kept them alive, sheltered by eternal concepts such as national sovereignty, basic human rights, the survival of the planet and the self-determination of peoples. After all, in the hierarchy of the values that define our highest aspirations, the supreme goal of society and State continues to be the human person, and the supreme good we are trying to achieve is not growth, not development, not globalization, but happiness and well- being. This is the right time, then, to seek alternatives such as the needed reinforcement of multilateral institutions with funds on preferential terms to support development; increased cooperation in order to foster better opportunities for those most in need and to reduce imbalances and close the distance between the richest and the poorest; the governing of globalization so that it does not demand sacrifices from most nations while concentrating its benefits in a few; and the search for additional, expeditious mechanisms to reduce the foreign debt that is choking most of humankind. The United Nations must become the appropriate forum to foster these and other initiatives required to guarantee better conditions for developing countries, intelligent measures to ensure universal peace and harmony. Honduras, its people and its Government, declare their faith in the superior qualities of man and his capacity for hope and faith in a better destiny for all humankind. We are sure that the unity of all the peoples of the earth around the essential topics of peace, survival 9 of the planet, a worldwide economic system that is more balanced and really open to all and the construction of societies that are fairer, freer, and safer will remain the raison d?être of the United Nations and its most important task. In this effort, the Organization can count on the support and solidarity of Honduras and other Central American States.   Mr. President, may I take this opportunity, as President of the Republic of South Africa and as Chairperson of the Non-Aligned Movement, to extend to you our sincere congratulations on your election to the high post of President of the General Assembly. You will be presiding over this august Assembly of the nations of the world at a time when its deliberations and decisions will be of the greatest consequence to the continuous striving of humanity at last to achieve global peace and prosperity. The Non-Aligned Movement, as well as my own country, which is a proud member of that Movement, invests great trust in this Organization to discharge its responsibilities to all nations, especially at this critical period of its existence. Quite appropriately, this fifty-third session of the General Assembly will be remembered through the ages as the moment at which we marked and celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Born in the aftermath of the defeat of the Nazi and fascist crime against humanity, this Declaration held high the hope that all our societies would, in future, be built on the foundations of the glorious vision spelt out in each of its clauses. For those who had to fight for their emancipation, those such as ourselves, who, with United Nations help, had to free ourselves from the criminal apartheid system, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights served as the vindication of the justice of our cause. At the same time, it constituted a challenge to us that our freedom, once achieved, should be dedicated to the implementation of the perspectives contained in the Declaration. Today we celebrate the fact that this historic document has survived a turbulent five decades, which have seen some of the most extraordinary developments in the evolution of human society. These include the collapse of the colonial system, the passing of a bipolar world, breathtaking advances in science and technology and the achievement of the complex process of globalization. And yet, at the end of it all, the human beings who are the subject of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights continue to be afflicted by wars and violent conflicts. They have, as yet, not attained their freedom from fear of death that would be brought about by the use of weapons of mass destruction as well as conventional arms. Many are still unable to exercise the fundamental and inalienable democratic rights that would enable them to participate in the determination of the destiny of their countries, nations, families and children and to protect themselves from tyranny and dictatorship. The very right to be human is denied every day to hundreds of millions of people as a result of poverty and the unavailability of basic necessities, such as food, jobs, water and shelter, education, health care and a healthy environment. The failure to achieve the vision contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights finds dramatic expression in the contrast between wealth and poverty which characterizes the divide between the countries of the North and the countries of the South and within individual countries in all hemispheres. It is made especially poignant and challenging by the fact that this coexistence of wealth and poverty, the perpetuation of the practice of the resolution of inter-State and intra-State conflicts by war and the denial of the democratic right of many across the world, all result from acts of commission and omission, particularly by those who occupy positions of leadership in politics, in the economy, and in other spheres of human activity. 13 What I am trying to say is that all these social ills, which constitute an offence against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, are not a preordained result of the forces of nature or the product of a curse of the deities. They are the consequence of decisions which men and women take or refuse to take, men and women all of whom will not hesitate to pledge their devoted support for the vision conveyed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This Declaration was proclaimed as universal precisely because the founders of this Organization and the nations of the world that joined hands to fight the scourge of fascism, including many that still had to achieve their own emancipation, understood clearly that our human world was an interdependent whole. Necessarily, the values of happiness, justice, human dignity, peace and prosperity have a universal application, because each people and every individual is entitled to them. Similarly, no people can truly say it is blessed with happiness, peace and prosperity where others, as human as themselves, continue to be afflicted with misery, conflict, terrorism and deprivation. Thus can we say that the challenge posed by the next 50 years of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and by the next century whose character it must help to fashion, consists in whether humanity, and especially those who will occupy positions of leadership, will have the courage to ensure that at last we build a human world consistent with the provisions of that historic Declaration and other human rights instruments that have been adopted since 1948. Immediately, a whole range of areas of conflict confronts us, in Africa, Europe and Asia. All of us are familiar with these, which range from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola and Sudan on my own continent, to the Balkans in Europe and Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Sri Lanka in Asia. Clearly, this Organization, and especially the Security Council, acting together with people of goodwill in the countries and areas concerned, has a responsibility to act decisively to contribute to the termination of these destructive conflicts. Continuously, we have to fight to defeat the primitive tendency towards the glorification of arms, the adulation of force, born of the illusion that justice can be guaranteed by the capacity to kill, or that disputes are necessarily best resolved by resort to violent means. As Africans, we are grateful to the Secretary-General for the contribution he has made to help us find the way towards ending violent strife on our continent. We have taken heed of his report, which will reinforce our efforts to banish war from our shores. I have not yet read the report from page to page, but I will try to do so. The very first resolution of the General Assembly, adopted in January 1946, sought to address the challenge of “the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction”. (resolution 1 (I), para. 5 (c)) We must face the fact that after countless initiatives and resolutions, we still do not have concrete and generally accepted proposals supported by a clear commitment by the nuclear-weapon States to the speedy, final and total elimination of nuclear weapons and nuclear-weapon capabilities. We take this opportunity to salute our sister Republic of Brazil for its decision to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to urge all others that have not yet done so to follow this excellent example. In an honest attempt to contribute to the definition of the systematic and progressive steps required to eliminate these weapons and the threat of annihilation which they pose, South Africa, together with Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia and Sweden, will be submitting a draft resolution to the First Committee for consideration by the Assembly. It is appropriately titled “Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: the need for a new agenda”. I call with all humility on all Members of the United Nations seriously to consider this important draft resolution and to give it their support. We must ask the question, which might sound naive to those who have elaborated sophisticated arguments to justify their refusal to eliminate these terrible and terrifying weapons of mass destruction — why do they need them, anyway? In reality, no rational answer can be advanced to explain in a satisfactory manner what, in the end, is the consequence of cold-war inertia and an attachment to the use of the threat of brute force to assert the primacy of some States over others. 14 Urgent steps are also required to arrive at a just and permanent peace in the Middle East on the basis of the realization of the legitimate aspirations of the people of Palestine and respect for the independence and security of all the States of this important region. We also look forward to the resolution of the outstanding issues of Western Sahara and East Timor, convinced that it is possible to take these matters off the world agenda on the basis of settlements that meet the interests of all the peoples concerned. Similarly, we would like to salute the bold steps taken by the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, this supremely important country of Africa, to enable it to return to democratic rule and a system of governance directed at serving the interests of all its people. Together we are also faced with the scourges of drug abuse and the illicit traffic in narcotics, organized transnational crime and international terrorism. We strongly support the measures adopted or being discussed by the United Nations to deal with these challenges and commit our country and Government to cooperate fully in all regional and international initiatives to ensure that the peoples of the world, including our own, are spared the destructive impact of these crimes. The world is gripped by an economic crisis, which, as President Clinton said in this city only a week ago, has plunged millions into sudden poverty and disrupted and disoriented the lives of ordinary people, and brought deep personal disappointment to tens of millions of people around the world. President Clinton also said: “Recent press reports have described an entire generation working its way into the middle class for over 25 years, then being plummeted into poverty within a matter of months. The stories are heartbreaking — doctors and nurses forced to live in the lobby of a closed hospital; middle-class families who owned their own homes, sent their children to college, travelled abroad, now living by selling their possessions.” President Clinton said that “fast-moving currents” in the world economy “have brought or aggravated problems in Russia and Asia. They threaten emerging economies from Latin America to South Africa”, and he spoke of sacrificing lives in the name of economic theory. He further recognized that with a quarter of the world’s population in declining growth, the United States, in Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan’s words, “ cannot forever be an oasis of prosperity.' Growth at home depends upon growth abroad”. I have quoted the President of the United States at such length both because he is correct and because he is the leader of the most powerful country in the world. Accordingly, we would like to believe that with the problem facing all humanity, and especially the poor, having thus been recognized, courage will not desert the powerful when it comes to determining the correct course to be taken, and following this course, addressing the challenge that has been identified. The tragedy President Clinton describes goes far beyond the sudden impoverishment of the middle class to which he correctly refers. Poverty has been and is the condition of the daily existence of even larger numbers of ordinary working people. Paradoxically, the challenge of poverty around the globe has been brought into sharp focus by the destructive fast movements of currents of wealth from one part of the world to another. Put starkly, we have a situation in which the further accumulation of wealth, rather than contributing to the improvement of the quality of life of all humanity, is generating poverty at a frighteningly accelerated pace. The imperative to act on this urgent, life-and-death matter can no longer be ignored. The central challenge to ensure that the countries of the South gain access to the productive resources that have accumulated within the world economy should not be avoided by seeking to apportion as much blame as possible to the poor. Clearly, all relevant matters will have to be addressed, including such issues as greater inflows of long-term capital; terms of trade; debt cancellation; technology transfers; human resource development; the emancipation of women and the development of the young; the elimination of poverty; the HIV/AIDS epidemic; environmental protection; and the strengthening of financial and other institutions relevant to sustained economic growth and development. 15 Fortunately, it is no longer in dispute that serious work will also have to be done to restructure the multilateral financial and economic institutions so that they address the problems of the modern world economy and become responsive to the urgent needs of the poor of the world. Similarly, this very Organization, including its important Security Council, must itself go through its own process of reformation so that it serves the interests of the peoples of the world, in keeping with the purposes for which it was established. The issues we have mentioned were discussed in a comprehensive manner at the Twelfth Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement held in the city of Durban, South Africa, earlier this month. I am privileged to commend the decisions of that important meeting to the General Assembly and the United Nations as a whole, including the Durban Declaration, which the Summit adopted unanimously. I am certain that the decisions adopted by the Non-Aligned Movement will greatly assist this Organization in its work and further enhance the contribution of the countries of the South to the solution of the problems that face the nations of the world, both rich and poor. This is probably the last time I will have the honour to stand at this rostrum to address the General Assembly. Born as the First World War came to a close, and departing from public life as the world marks half a century of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, I have reached that part of the long walk when the opportunity is granted, as it should be to all men and women, to retire to some rest and tranquillity in the village of my birth. As I sit in Qunu, my village, and grow as ancient as its hills, I will continue to entertain the hope that there has emerged a cadre of leaders in my own country and region, on my continent and in the world, which will not allow that any should be denied their freedom, as we were; that any should be turned into refugees, as we were; that any should be condemned to go hungry, as we were; that any should be stripped of their human dignity, as we were. I will continue to hope that Africa’s renaissance will strike deep roots and blossom forever, without regard to the changing seasons. Were all these hopes to translate into a realizable dream and not a nightmare to torment the soul of the aged, then will I, indeed, have peace and tranquillity. Then would history and the billions throughout the world proclaim that it was right that we dreamt and that we toiled to give life to a workable dream.   Allow me at the outset, Mr. President, on behalf of the people and Government of my country, the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, to extend my sincere condolences to all the States and peoples who have suffered devastation from Hurricane Georges, and to the victims of the floods in the People’s Republic of China and in Bangladesh. I am pleased to be able to join with the distinguished and worthy representatives of States and Governments who have preceded me at this rostrum in extending to you, Sir, on behalf of the President of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, His Excellency El Hadj Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim, my warm congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third regular session. I also pay tribute to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, as well as to the greatly respected Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of our Organization, for the dedication, skill and other outstanding qualities which they have shown in carrying out their respective functions. My country, which is located at the north-west entrance to the Mozambique Channel, half way between the East African coast and the large island of Madagascar, small, fragmented and geographically isolated though it is, was accepted to full membership in the United Nations on 12 November 1975 by resolution 3385 (XXX), as a State comprising the islands of Anjouan, Grande-Comore — also known as Ngazidja — Mayotte and Mohéli. We should also note that from 1889 until the referendum through which my country acceded to independence, all the laws and other regulatory texts applied by the former colonial Power recognized and sanctioned the territorial unity and integrity of the archipelago of the Comoros. Thus for 23 years, at each of the regular sessions of this Assembly, successive resolutions have been adopted recalling that the continuation of the legal, administrative and military hold of the former colonial Power over the Comorian island of Mayotte is a flagrant violation of resolution 1514 (XV) and of the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter. We therefore hope that the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Ad Hoc Committee of Seven on the Question of the Comorian Island of Mayotte, presided over by His Excellency Mr. Omar Bongo, President of the Republic of Gabon, will resume its work and re-establish the dialogue between the Comoros and France on this question. Finally, we appeal to the wisdom and goodwill beyond our continent, so that the Comoros can return once and for all to the path of peace, security and hope. I should like solemnly to appeal to this Assembly for assistance to my country so that a solution to the problem caused by its dismemberment can be found and my country can enter the twenty-first century as a reunited country. The people, Government and head of State whom I am honoured and privileged to represent here today would like to express, through my delegation, their gratitude and acknowledgement to the Secretary-General of our universal Organization for the clarity and lucidity of his analysis of the causes of conflict on the African continent and for his courageous initiatives in the search for peace and sustainable development in Africa and throughout the world. In this context, we urge the United Nations system and its specialized agencies to do all in their power to ensure the rapid and complete implementation of all of the recommendations provided by the Secretary-General in his report to the Security Council which he presented last April. 4 My Government urgently appeals to the international community for cooperation to effectively combat terrorism in all its forms. Only international determination, with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, will make it possible to put an end to horrendous terrorist acts. Terrorism spares no part of the world and no stratum of society. Who can forget the murderous acts committed this summer in Omagh, Ireland; Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam; Cape Town, South Africa; and Luxor, Egypt? For our part, my Government is cooperating openly and fully with the American authorities to shed light on the suspected participation of a national of my country in the abhorrent crimes committed in East Africa. Since my country is a telling example of the hotbeds of tension which are now mobilizing the resources of the international community, I should like to recall that for a year and a half now the Organization of African Unity has taken up — in close cooperation with the League of Arab States, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and, very recently, the Non-Aligned Movement — the separatist crisis on the Comorian island of Anjouan and the links to be established with the dismemberment of our archipelago State by the island of Mayotte’s continuing to be under foreign administration. The efforts and commitments of the Secretary-General of the OAU, Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim, and his Special Envoys, Ambassador Pierre Yéré and Mr. Mamoudou Kane, since the beginning of the crisis, as well as the efforts of the Governments involved in regional coordination to resolve the crisis in the Comoros, namely, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, South Africa, Madagascar, Mauritius and the Seychelles, have been recognized and deserve admiration and support. My country’s people, Government and head of State would like to convey through my delegation to the entire international community their commitment to peace and unity and reconciliation between the community of islands which make up the nation of the Comoros. Special mention should be made here of the most respected statesman of our world, President Nelson Mandela, who, in his dual capacity as head of State entrusted with regional coordination to resolve the crisis in the Comoros, mandated by the OAU, and Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, has agreed to bring to bear his full authority and his personal prestige throughout the world to call upon the parties in conflict in the Comoros to conclude a peace of the brave, in which there is neither victor nor vanquished, peace brought about for the greatest possible benefit of the inhabitants of our archipelago State. In the light of the claims and the rights acknowledged by our institutions, traditions, conventions and customs in a multi-island society, El Hadj Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim, President of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, declared after the OAU summit in Ouagadougo, and again recently in Durban during the NAM summit, that he was ready to work in a spirit of openness and reconciliation for greater decentralization and autonomy for each of the four islands making up our archipelago State. Thus each of our islands will be able to elect a governor and a local legislative assembly to deal with all matters relating to the immediate and particular concerns of each of our communities of the islands of the archipelago State. An inter-island commission will work for the equitable and proportional distribution of the international community’s resources and investments. Here I quote what El Hadj Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim has rightly said, as follows: “This is an issue of bringing the administration closer to its subjects, promoting the responsibility within a single citizenry and restoring the federal bodies of a united State their fundamental roles of organization, arbitration and the management of international sovereignty. “The future of our country will only be ensured when all opinions and all trends, in an atmosphere of greater tolerance, are accepted and fulfilled.” (spoke in Arabic) “Thus have We made of you An Unmat justly balanced. That ye might be witnesses Over the nations, And the Messenger a witness Over yourselves”. (The Holy Koran, II:143)  The fifty-third session of the General Assembly provides us once again with an opportunity to look at the overall situation in the world and to reflect together on the future of the peoples and the nations that we represent. But first of all, may I extend to Mr. Didier Opertti our warm and sincere congratulations on his well-deserved election, which is but recognition of his intellectual and personal qualities and which, I am certain, will ensure the success of the work of this session. We would like also to pay a warm tribute to his predecessor, who presided so brilliantly over the work of the previous session. My delegation is pleased to express appreciation for the courageous and ongoing work being carried out by Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, in support of peace in the world and particularly on the African continent. When on 25 July 1996 we had to carry out a very radical change of government in Burundi, the political situation was an explosive one. Every day Burundians were dying without really knowing why, and the threat of genocide and widespread chaos was a very real danger. I shall not go into the details of that situation, as the Security Council, the Secretary-General and his representative in Bujumbura have followed on a daily basis the evolution of the crisis which has in recent years disrupted my country. Since that change on 25 July 1996, we have stated clearly that restoration of security and the beginning of a peace process are our basic concerns. This fifty-third session provides me with an opportunity to tell you about the efforts made by the people of Burundi, its leaders and the international community to attain our goals of restoring a lasting peace in the country. Despite some acts of terrorism, I can say to this Assembly that security has now been fully restored in Burundi. The threat of genocide so feared by its people is gone today. Two years ago the peace process was initiated; it is now under way and proceeding in a manner satisfactory to all those concerned. I should like to focus my statement today on this peace project. The idea of a peace-process project in Burundi is based on the realization that despite the ethnic turn taken by violence which brought such tragedy to my country over the last five years, the underlying cause of the Burundi crisis is essentially a political one. That is why we are focusing our efforts on seeking a political solution to the crisis. Two years ago we set in motion a peace process which was divided into two aspects: the internal aspect and the external aspect. At the internal level, the dynamic provided by the peace process led to a domestic agreement on political partnership. Two years ago, the Government which emerged from the change of 25 July 1996 and the National Assembly elected in 1993 began a dialogue geared towards a political rapprochement. This initiative led to an agreement on political partnership. Today, we have a provisional constitution which came out of that partnership and which governs the institutions of our Republic, primarily the Government and the National Assembly. In Burundi, the political partnership is a reality not only between Government and the National Assembly but also with the majority of the registered political parties and the representatives of civil society who have joined the partnership for peace. It is within this framework that a negotiated Government, bringing together the main political forces in the country, is now in place and has been functioning for three months. The National Assembly elected in 1993 has been expanded to include representatives of other registered political parties and representatives of civil society. I can say to this Assembly — and those who have visited Burundi recently have been able to note this themselves — that this partnership has transformed, and continues to transform, the political landscape in Burundi in a positive way. Today, the political class within our country is organizing a wide-ranging discussion on the partnership to enable the people of Burundi to absorb the idea of peace, the ultimate objective being stabilization of the country through the restoration of peace. The Government, for its part, is preparing its programme based on the political agreement which emerged from the partnership. The major issues, such as democracy, justice, security and development, are in the forefront of this programme which the Government will be submitting to the parliament at its next session in October. My Government is determined to continue consolidating the partnership within the country. We deeply believe that this approach can establish the bases for an overall agreement associating our compatriots living abroad with our peace project. It was the existence of this political partnership at the domestic level which made possible the beginning of a process of global negotiations involving Burundians abroad in the peace process. The negotiations, bringing together people of Burundi living at home and abroad, began on 15 June 1998 in Arusha, in the United Republic of Tanzania. The second negotiating session took place on 20 July, and the third meeting is scheduled for 12 October. These negotiations are proceeding in a manner satisfactory to all the participants: the Burundians, the facilitator and the representatives of the international community. I should like to declare that the Government of Burundi is resolved to do its utmost to assure the success of these negotiations. We divided the peace process into two aspects, domestic and external, because it is simply a question of methodology. The peace process is one and indivisible. First of all, we wanted to get the people of Burundi involved in the peace process before the Arusha negotiations, so that we could take into consideration the recent experience of our subregion. Peace negotiations which do not involve the people often take a tragic turn. I should like to declare from this rostrum that the peace process is now under way to the satisfaction of the people of Burundi. We are determined to resolve through dialogue the dispute pitting Burundians one against the other. Unfortunately, there are obstacles along our path towards lasting peace, the main one being the economic sanctions imposed on Burundi on 31 July 1996. These economic sanctions affect in particular the most vulnerable sectors of our society. They are destroying the economic and social fabric of the country and over the long term are jeopardizing stabilization over the long term in our country. In fact, the impact of the embargo on the people of Burundi is devastating. Let me give you a few figures: grade school attendance has dropped from 70 to 43 per cent; the vaccination rate has plummeted from 80 to 40 per cent and malnutrition among children under the age of 5 is now 43 per cent. Moreover, the embargo imposed on Burundi is now enriching a few individuals in the country in a scandalous manner and is tragically impoverishing millions of people there. This embargo is eroding trust between the mediators and the parties to the conflict, particularly the Government of Burundi. Even though all the conditions imposed by those who initiated the embargo have now been met, the economic sanctions are still being 2 maintained. Today there is absolutely no justification, moral or political, for continuing the embargo against Burundi. I would appeal to the countries of our subregion and to the mediator organizing the negotiations in Arusha to lift the embargo before it definitively torpedoes our peace project. Our appeal is also directed to the international community for support in our effort at peace-building in Burundi. We must act now to concert our peace efforts. Tomorrow will be too late. Those who have sinned by omission will bear an important responsibility. The other significant obstacle to peace in Burundi is the continuing violence perpetrated by armed factions based in the territories of certain neighbouring countries. I call on those countries to assume their share of the responsibility. One cannot both call for negotiations and tolerate terrorist actions by armed groups without jeopardizing the entire peace process. For negotiations to begin, there must be a cessation of hostilities. Burundi, a landlocked country under economic sanctions, needs international solidarity. Humanitarian assistance must be stepped up in order to help those afflicted by this crisis. We would wish to see international cooperation with our country resumed without further delay. Security conditions are no worse in Burundi than in the other countries of the Great Lakes region. Burundians simply ask to be treated fairly. Our commitment and resolve to achieve peace in Burundi through dialogue must no longer be called into question. The facts today speak for themselves. We are negotiating with all Burundians who have political demands. My country?s domestic concerns will not allow me to forget the other problems afflicting Africa and the world. Far from it. At this time of globalization, a sustained effort must be made by the international community to promote balanced development throughout the world. Africa deserves special attention. If one advocates development through trade, then one must also increase official development assistance to stimulate the growth of economies that remain fragile. Africa is being crushed by the weight of its debt. The burden must be eased and eliminated for the poorest countries. Globalization without solidarity with the poorest nations will not lead to a peaceful world. In order to adapt to inevitable changes, the developing countries must organize themselves. Here, I envision the creation of regional areas of integration that will make our economies viable. We are in favour of regional integration, but one that respects the identity and sovereignty of each country. We are opposed to regional integration that includes the domination and hegemony of the most powerful. Regional economic integration can be achieved, however, only in secure regions. Our region of the Great Lakes remains subject to extreme instability. This cyclical insecurity has endured for decades and has unleashed floods of refugees. Entire defeated armies move through the region, which has already experienced an unprecedented genocide. We continue to follow very carefully the evolution of the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I wish to reaffirm that our country, Burundi, is in no way involved in that conflict. However, we remain concerned, on the one hand, by a certain tenor of statement that pits peoples against peoples on the basis of ethnic identity; and, on the other, by militias and certain rebels, whom we in the region remember only too well. I would urge all participants in this conflict not to allow themselves to be entrapped and led down that road, because it leads only to danger that could engulf the entire region in flames. Burundi will continue to ensure that its security is not destabilized. To that end, we shall take all appropriate measures. We continue to advocate peaceful means and dialogue to resolve this conflict. If the Government of Burundi is asked to contribute to a political solution, it will be very happy to do so. In Burundi, we believe that the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations should coordinate their efforts more effectively in seeking a solution to the crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly when we consider the limitations of subregional organizations. At the global level, every region of our planet faces varying degrees of environmental degradation, terrorism, endemic disease, drug abuse and hunger, to mention only the most widespread threats. To cope with this situation, the United Nations will have to play a decisive role. Our Organization has, in the past, demonstrated its strengths and its weaknesses. To take up these many challenges, the United Nations must open itself up and become more democratic 3 if it is to become more effective in addressing the realities of the modern world. In order better to resolve the problems of peace, the Security Council should be judiciously expanded to include other Members of the Organization. Within the United Nations, Burundi will continue to raise its modest voice against terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and in favour of allocating greater resources to combat poverty and encourage education and health, particularly in developing countries — in short, to build a more balanced and fairer world. In our view, this is the challenge facing our Organization as we approach the new millennium. eychelles is pleased to see Mr. Opertti at the helm of this session of the General Assembly. We welcome the experience, expertise and skills which he brings to our deliberations. Likewise, we wish to express our appreciation to his predecessor for his outstanding contribution and leadership during the fiftysecond session. Our felicitations also go to the Secretary-General for spearheading courageous and innovative reforms aimed at revitalizing the United Nations at the threshold of the new millennium. We support the measures being undertaken to make the United Nations more efficient and effective, capable of making optimal use of its resources. My delegation believes that development ought to be central to the renewed United Nations agenda. For this reason, we hold that a larger proportion of United Nations resources should be allocated to development, particularly to meet the growing and imperious needs of the developing countries. It is only in so doing that the objective of attaining a “dividend for development” can be attained. Reform of the United Nations cannot be complete without the reform of its main organ responsible for peace and security: the Security Council. We are all agreed on this, but we differ on how to go about it. Yet there is no doubt that the Security Council should be transformed into a democratic and representative organ, reflecting both its universal character and present-day realities, and taking into consideration the need for balanced representation in its membership. Many options have been mooted. But there are still major obstacles to overcome if we are to agree on the composition of the enlarged Council, the creation of new permanent seats and the question of the veto right for both current and prospective members. We need to move and harmonize positions in order to arrive at a generally acceptable solution. And in so doing we must reckon with the fact that the developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America are and will be major stakeholders in the formulation of the international power structure of the twenty-first century. Equally important for my delegation is that the reform package should encompass the enhancement of the General Assembly as the supreme policy-making organ of the United Nations. It is only through the reinforcement of the Assembly’s role and mandate that we can successfully tackle some of the most pressing issues facing humanity, not least the process of globalization. Globalization has brought prosperity to some. However, in this new global village, many of its inhabitants — especially those in its slums — face the prospect of further impoverishment and marginalization. For them, the spectre of poverty, hunger, malnutrition, inadequate shelter and disease is a constant reality. It is their daily lot. It flouts human dignity. No one should have to live and die in poverty. This is not how we envisage the destiny of the greater part of humankind in the twenty-first century. So the greatest challenge facing us, the United Nations, is the eradication of the slums of our global village. If we want to get rid of the scourge of poverty, we need to redress the present imbalances. We need to ensure that all countries of the world benefit from the effects of globalization. Our basic contention — and I do not think that it is too much to ask for — is that we should be able to increase our share in the global economy, be it through trade or through the mobilization of foreign direct investment. As small developing economies, we face the enormous challenge of building our export and institutional capacities to allow us to assume our place in this fiercely competitive global environment. If we are to attract investments, improve product quality, meet standards — in short, compete effectively and grasp the opportunities presented by the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements — then it is imperative that the international community recognize the need to grant us adequate transitional support. It is in this context that my delegation appeals to the European Union to accept the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of States’ request for an extension of trade preferences under a WTO waiver for a protracted period of time, within the framework of the successor agreement to the Lomé IV Convention. Genuine cooperation should take cognizance of the special development need of weaker and vulnerable partners to adjust to the demands of competitiveness. We need time to allow a transitional period of preparation and adjustment. And we need to do so under fair conditions. We small island developing States are the weaker and more vulnerable members of the international community. It is a well-established fact. But whilst momentum has been created for the recognition of our special characteristics and constraints, it is somewhat disappointing to note that avowed intentions have yet to be translated into action. How are we to interpret this apparent inertia in the application of the so-called vulnerability index? How are we to interpret this apparent indifference to the problems we face, especially in relation to security, sustainable development and environmental protection? Vulnerability has taught us in the Seychelles a few lessons, though. Whilst our voice is little heard in this forum, whenever we are asked about our role on the world stage our response generally reveals an impressive scoresheet in such areas as conservation of the environment and an equally ambitious vision of our place in the world. We continue to work very hard to ensure that the development necessary to give our people a high degree of social well-being does not affect the “last sanctuary on Earth”, as we call ourselves. “Environment” for us is not a fashion statement. We do not intend to give any lessons, but we certainly intend to be the conscience of the world. Whilst others, infinitely more powerful and developed than we are, pollute and spoil, we preserve and protect. We have set aside some 45 per cent of our national territory for the protection of nature. And we have offered to the international community two of its most precious natural treasures as World Heritage Sites. But all this has a cost. We bear the brunt of it, conscious of our responsibility to future generations, conscious that planet Earth is our common heritage. Ours, though, is a shared responsibility, requiring global solutions to a global problem. And the solution is to be found not in rhetoric, but in action. Therefore, we expect the industrialized nations to pay less lip service to environmental protection. We expect them to be accountable and to meet their Kyoto commitments. Above all, we expect them to get their act together and clean up the mess we are all in. Vulnerability has also taught us to live in racial harmony, to make ours the ideals for which the United Nations stands for. The force of our social cohesion lies in our racial diversity. Africans, Asians and Europeans have forged our nation, resulting in a happy marriage of races that has led to an eclectic population of 79,000 2 people living in harmony and tolerance. When we see what goes on around us — wars, acts of wanton terrorism and destruction, savagery and barbarism — all in the name of some insane ideology, religious, racial or political, we fail to comprehend. We fail to understand, perhaps because we have learned to live together as one nation, regardless of racial origin or political or religious conviction. We try very hard to mitigate the effects of our vulnerability. If we have achieved some degree of success, it is through the prudent and often painstaking management of our natural resources. It is also through the judicious use of international aid and grants that we have received over the years. We have not wasted a cent of what has been awarded to us. We have managed overseas development assistance by creating a beneficial multiplier effect that has trickled down into all spheres and levels of our national development. Unfortunately, the logic and unwritten laws of international cooperation will have it that we have become victims of this very prudent use of aid. We seem to have worked ourselves off the list of nations that qualify for such help. In this interdependent world of ours, the ramifications of globalization have proved that the world order has no frontiers. Solutions to the challenges of the new international order are to be sought through international solidarity and cooperation, through the vehicle of multilateralism. This presupposes that every member of the international community should enjoy peace and security. Unfortunately, too many conflict situations persist, negating economic growth and social progress. The African continent has been disproportionately afflicted by intra-State and inter-State conflicts. At the special meeting of the Security Council on Africa in April this year, we urged the international community to put its full weight behind African peace initiatives, but also to reinforce the institutional and operational capacity of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts in Africa. Finding durable solutions to our problems in Africa requires a concerted and integrated approach by the international community if we want to make the African renaissance a reality in an era of global solidarity and partnership. Speaking of peace and security, we cannot but empathize with a fellow small island State — Cyprus — with which we are sentimentally bound in a common destiny. The division of the island has persisted for too long. We cannot allow it to continue as a fait accompli. Nor can we condone the presence of foreign troops there. Cyprus is a unitary, sovereign State whose intercommunal problems can only be resolved on the basis of Security Council resolutions. In a separate but related context, we note with regret the continuing tension in Greek-Turkish relations. My country, like all peace-loving nations, would like to see Greece and Turkey establish good-neighbourly relations based on international law and treaties, as well as on the basis of the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. Differences are bound to remain, but these can be resolved within mechanisms available in international law, in particular, through the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. We urge Turkey to accept the Court’s jurisdiction. We are conscious of the inequalities and double standards which prevail throughout the world. The rules of the game, more often than not, are not tipped in favour of the smallest among us. Indeed, relations between nations give the lie to the statement that we are all equal. This is the reality of things. We do not say that we necessarily accept the status quo. But we have learned to live with it. Neither do we accept that squalor, injustice and poverty should be the norms guiding relations between human beings in the next millennium. So, in recognizing our own shortcomings and failures, we also recognize that humankind is presented with a unique opportunity to right the wrongs and injustices that it has perpetrated. We are also presented with a unique opportunity to make our planet, our only home, a better, cleaner and safer place to live. We can do so through a proactive United Nations. It is not a perfect institution. But it is the only institution which represents the collective conscience of humanity. It represents the unique, indispensable forum for shared international responsibilities and global issues which affect the entire community of nations. The United Nations remains our greatest hope for justice, peace, security and development. It remains our only hope for a more compassionate world.   At the outset I would like to congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti on his unanimous election to the presidency of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. His election is a well-deserved tribute to his own admirable diplomatic skills and also a vote of confidence in his country, Uruguay. My delegation intends to cooperate fully with him as he guides the work of this Assembly. I would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to his predecessor, our friend Hennadiy Udovenko, of the Republic of Ukraine, for the able and exemplary manner in which he presided over the work of the fifty-second session. In the same vein, we would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, whose style of work and vigorous response to the various crises that have beset the international community we deeply appreciate. We want to reiterate our confidence in his work and continued support for his leadership. Following the United Nations fiftieth anniversary celebrations, we, the Member States, reaffirmed our commitment to the purposes and principles of the Organization as enshrined in the Charter and further took on the responsibility of charting an institutional 9 framework and operational parameters that would enhance the Organizationâs relevance and effectiveness in the twenty-first century. The reform proposals made by the Secretary-General in 1997 attempted to articulate a vision of the future for a United Nations Organization that is more focused and coherent and one that better reflects the new geopolitical realities of the post-cold-war era. We are encouraged that the first phase of the reform of the United Nations system was launched when the Secretary-General began to implement those measures that fall within his sphere of competence as chief administrative officer of our Organization. My Government has taken full cognizance of those measures, as well as of proposals for reform, and is carefully considering them in detail. The proposal to convene a Millennium Assembly to articulate a vision for the United Nations in the new century has our full support. All Member States must actively participate in the preparations for and holding of the Millennium Assembly in order to come up with a consensus document to guide the Organization into the next century. However, we believe that the proposed sunset provisions, which are to effect cut-off mechanisms for some issues on the United Nations agenda, need to be carefully considered. My Government will lend its support to any development dividend that channels savings generated by administrative efficiency into a Development Account, especially if it benefits developing countries. We must continue to search for a general agreement on the proper and efficient utilization of the Development Account. When the reform process was first initiated, my Government alluded to the need for us, the Member States, to formulate a mechanism to deal with the financial crisis, which, much to our chagrin, continues to worsen. I reiterate once again that it is we, the Member States, who have to pay our dues promptly, in full and unconditionally or risk being an ineffective Organization that is incapable of meeting the challenges of the twenty-first century. Still on the process of reform, my Government is disappointed by the excruciatingly slow progress being made in the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters Related to the Security Council. The key issue of the expansion still preoccupies the Working Group and a solution continues to elude that Group. Africa, for its part, remains steadfast in its just demand for two permanent seats â€” to be shared on a rotational basis â€” as well as for three non-permanent seats. The system of rotation is an innovation that Africa is proposing in the name of democracy and sovereign equality of Member States. It may not suit other regions, and we have stated that we are preparing it for the Africa region alone. I take this opportunity once more to urge our friends outside the Africa region to support our just demand, as it is intended to enhance the representative nature and authority of the Security Council. It has also become apparent that the impasse in the deliberations of the Working Group is a result of the nonacceptance by a handful of powerful countries of the sacrosanct principles of equitable representation, democracy and transparency. We hold that the democratization of the United Nations system is integral to its continued legitimacy and efficacy. Conversely, the increasing inefficiencies and lack of efficacy that we witness today on the part of the Security Council are in large measure the consequence of its lack of moral authority, itself the result of the unrepresentative and undemocratic nature of the Council as it is presently constituted. In the name of human rights, pressure has been brought to bear especially on developing countries to democratize their national political systems and to become more transparent, and most of them have done so. We therefore insist that the same processes of democratization and transparency should characterize international relations, particularly the reform of the United Nations system. Let me recall that the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has on several occasions spoken against the anachronistic and undemocratic nature of the power of the veto. The Movement has proposed the restriction of the scope of the veto to matters pertaining to Chapter VII of the Charter, with a view to its eventual abolition. But while the veto exists we insist that all new permanent members should, in accordance with the principle of sovereign equality of Member States, equally wield the power of the veto. Africa has witnessed a dramatic broadening of relative peace and stability with the return of democracy to Liberia and Sierra Leone. The return of the legitimate Government of Sierra Leone is of particular significance to the African continent, as it came about as a result of resolute action by the Economic Community of West African States to reverse the military coup in that country. This was in conformity with an Organization of African Unity (OAU) watershed resolution taken at the Harare 10 summit in 1997 in response to the coup in Sierra Leone to the effect that henceforth Africa will not accept the change of a legitimate Government on the continent by military means. Another example of the positive political developments in Africa has been the various steps taken by the present Government of Nigeria to return that key country to democratic governance. It is only fair that those who have been critical of events in that country in the past should now openly welcome the recent positive developments. But the situation in Africa has not been without its disappointments. The deteriorating situation in Angola deserves our urgent attention. The achievement of peace and stability in that country continues to be obstructed by UNITAâs constant and deliberate non-compliance with the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol or with relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. We urge the UNITA leadership to heed to the voice of reason and give peace a chance in Angola. We equally urge those members of the international community who have influence on the UNITA leader to persuade him. In the meantime, we ask the international community to join Angola and the countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in their decision to work with those positive elements in UNITA who have committed themselves to continue with the peace process in Angola. Sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of States are age-old principles of international law, and respect for them is the bedrock of inter-State relations. These fundamental principles are at the core of the United Nations Charter, to which we all subscribe. They are held equally sacrosanct in the Non-Aligned Movement, the OAU and many other international organizations. Therefore any violation of these principles cannot and must not be taken lightly, as it poses a serious threat to international peace and security. Sadly, in our subregion, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has recently fallen victim to such flagrant violations of international law. In August this year, the Democratic Republic of the Congo found itself under siege by rebels supported by foreign troops. Realizing that the fall of Kinshasa was imminent, the legitimate Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, appealed for assistance from Southern African Development Community (SADC) member States to enable it to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo of allied forces from the SADC States of Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe is a response to this call and has the objective of upholding the fundamental provisions of the Charters of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) on the inviolability of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of member States. It is also in line with the OAU resolution approved at the Harare summit of 1997 condemning the change of legitimate Governments by military means, as well as in compliance with a 1995 resolution of the SADC Inter-State Defence and Security Committee in which SADC member States agreed to take collective action in cases of attempted coups to remove legitimate Governments by military means in the subregion. It is in conformity with that very decision taken by SADC that, as I speak, troops from the Republic of South Africa and the Republic of Botswana, two SADC countries, are involved in upholding the authority of the legal Government of Lesotho against army mutineers. My country remains committed to the search for a negotiated settlement to the crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charters of the United Nations, the OAU and of SADC. It will be recalled that since the outbreak of the conflict, Zimbabwe has hosted two summits with a view to finding durable peace and stability in the Great Lakes region. The second Victoria Falls summit, held from 7 to 8 September 1998, called for a ceasefire in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Zimbabwe remains committed to this process. We appeal to the international community to support Africaâs various initiatives aimed at establishing durable peace in the Great Lakes region. My country is concerned about the situation in the Horn of Africa, where fraternal forces of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and Eritrea are facing each other, ready to go to war. We appeal to these brotherly countries to continue cooperating with the OAU in the search for a peaceful resolution to the border conflict. In Western Sahara, we urge the parties to complete the Houston accords peace process by holding the proposed referendum. We condemn the recent killings of innocent people in the bombings of the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. We are disappointed by the stalemate in the Middle East peace process. We urge the Government of Israel to show flexibility in carrying 11 forward the peace process. The killing of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan is regrettable and unacceptable in inter-State relations. We urge the parties to the Lockerbie affair to seize the present opportunity to resolve this sad, long- standing issue. We ask for good faith on all sides in order to carry the process forward. The African continent continues to face a multitude of problems as it settles into the new world order. African countries are implementing painful political, social and economic adjustments to existing structures in order to respond to the twin processes of liberalization and globalization. We have embarked on structural adjustment programmes, often at the behest of the Bretton Woods institutions. These programmes have had a severely adverse impact on the social welfare of the African countries. The curtailment of expenditure on social programmes, particularly health and educational facilities, in the absence of the requisite safety nets, has worsened the living conditions of the majority of the African peoples and in some cases this has heightened instability and insecurity in our countries. For many developing countries, the issue of resource flows cannot be dissociated from that of the external debt problem. Figures continue to indicate that the overall debt of developing countries is still on the increase. We believe that new, comprehensive and coordinated approaches to the debt and debt-servicing problem have to be adopted, including outright forgiveness. The critical economic situation in Africa, the least developed and most marginalized of all regions, has to be addressed if global economic growth and interdependence are to have any meaning at all. Apart from the excruciating and debilitating debt, there is need for an increased flow of resources in the form of both official development assistance and foreign direct investment. I wish to conclude my remarks on economic matters by mentioning an issue that is of vital importance to the question of sustainable development: the World Solar Programme 1996-2005, which was adopted by the World Solar Commission. The promotion and popularization of solar energy technologies can be a major contribution to solving the worldâs energy crisis and ensuring the availability of a clean and inexhaustible source of energy for sustainable development. I urge all Member States to support the draft resolution on the World Solar Programme, which will be presented at this session. In the field of disarmament, the much vaunted peace dividend did not materialize at the end of the cold war. On the contrary, it appears that an arms race is still with us, and it is my Governmentâs strong conviction that the international community must continue to work purposefully for nuclear disarmament, as well as for the total removal from the face of our planet of other weapons of mass destruction and for stricter control over the production, sale and movement of small arms. My delegation was deeply disappointed that the United Nations Disarmament Commission this year concluded its substantive session without reaching an agreement on the need for, or the agenda of, the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. We owe it to posterity to lay the foundations of a third millennium free from nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. My Government welcomes the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, adopted at the fifty-second session of the General Assembly, and the recently adopted Statute of the proposed International Criminal Court. The international community has long witnessed how ill-equipped Member States of the United Nations have been in dealing with international terrorism, and for us in Africa the recent terrorist bombings of the United States embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, which together claimed about 260 lives, brought home to us the vulnerability of developing countries to the sophistication of modern terrorism. The Statute of the International Criminal Court has forged the missing link in the international legal order and is a genuine step forward in the field of human rights law. It has created new inter-State relationships and complementarity between national and international law. As we come to the close of the Decade of International Law, in 1999, we hope that the United Nations, especially the Security Council, will also take decisions that will result in the advancement of the primacy of the rule of law in international relations in the next century. In conclusion, my delegation wishes to make a brief comment on the contemporary realities of the international situation. Our balance sheet leaves much to be desired. On the credit side, we have seen a modest measure of success. We have witnessed a return to democracy and peace in some countries where once there was military despotism and armed conflict. We have successfully paved the way for the establishment of the International Criminal Court and forged new partnerships 12 between our regional organizations and the United Nations. Yet we still have a daunting debit side. Conflicts still rage in many parts of the world. Poverty, inequality and underdevelopment still remain the order of the day for 90 per cent of the worldâs population. The AIDS pandemic threatens to reverse the socio-economic gains made in most of our countries over the years. The ongoing financial crisis which engulfed South-East Asia and now threatens the entire world reminds us that current efforts at a new architecture both for controlling the free flow of money and ushering in a new discipline in the financial institutions should be brought about without delay. We have to confront and reduce world poverty with determination at a time when some within the Organization itself are still resisting the democratic changes that are necessary for enhancing the image and authority of the Organization and making it effective in addressing these problems. Zimbabwe believes that the time for change is here and now and that Member States have a moral obligation to muster the political will to make those changes. Let the fifty-third session of the General Assembly be one of qualitative and meaningful change for the people of the world.   In just 15 months, our world will enter a new millennium, leaving behind it a chequered past to face the challenges of a yet uncharted future. It is not too early to contemplate this historic conjuncture and to give some thought to how best we may deal with the uncertainties ahead. This fifty-third session of the General Assembly offers, we believe, a timely opportunity for such reflection. Your leadership, Mr. President, will be essential to the success of our exploration. We are assured that your diplomatic experience and skills, demonstrated in the service of your native Uruguay, will contribute greatly to the success of our deliberations. To your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of the Ukraine, we offer our sincere appreciation and thanks for the admirable guidance which he provided the Assembly over the past year. Our gratitude is extended to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the inspired direction which he has given to our Organization. From the report that he has been good enough to present us on the activities of the last 12 months, we are able to see clearly those areas where our stated goals have been reached and, equally importantly, those which require our further attention and effort. Certainly, among the developments that are most heartening is the spread of democracy within recent times. It is a happy coincidence that this year we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights, which embodies the principles of democracy. The democratic system has emerged as a popular form of government for many States Members of the United Nations. Guyana has rejoined this growing majority. Unfortunately, this had to come after hard struggles and our people experienced three decades of lost opportunities under an undemocratic regime. Only last December, for the second time this decade, elections were held under international scrutiny, leading to the re-election of my 4 Government to office. However, despite the fact that the outcome was adjudged by international observers to be free and fair, the minority opposition refuses to abide by the result. Consequently, the will of the electorate has been questioned. Unfortunately, this negation of elections conducted in a free and fair manner is not limited to Guyana and increasingly requires our attention. Naturally, my Government cannot tolerate this state of affairs, nor should the United Nations, which by its Charter is called upon to protect the gains of new and restored democracies. It is vital that the international community and the United Nations rally in support of our efforts to achieve better governance and to guarantee the enjoyment of all human rights by our citizens. We need to go beyond the holding of periodic elections to ensuring the observance of the rule of law and building the institutions upon which democracy must rest. Regrettably, many of our democracies are severely limited, in terms of their own resources, in their ability to satisfy these pressing needs. As a result, hard-won gains are under constant threat of erosion. We firmly believe that it is in the interest of the international community as a whole to assist in the strengthening of the democratic system as a bulwark against encroachment by oppressive regimes. Only through such cooperation can the democratic ideal take root and flourish throughout the world. On our part, we will staunchly defend the gains of our people and we are resolved not to allow ourselves to slide once again into the darkness of dictatorship. Needless to say, the spread of democracy within States must be matched by democracy among States. The United Nations was founded in 1945 on the premise of the sovereign equality of all States. This principle is the rock upon which international cooperation among peoples has been built. In their operation, therefore, all organs and agencies within the international system must be cognizant of the views and wishes of all States. Developing countries in particular need to be adequately represented in these bodies to ensure that their concerns are addressed. In this scheme of things, we attach great importance to reaching general agreement on how the Security Council must be transformed into an organ that enjoys the confidence and support of all States. Clearly, the body which was created in the aftermath of the Second World War is no longer appropriate to the circumstances of todayâs world. Sorely needed now is a more representative and transparent Council that can adequately address new threats to international peace and security. Accordingly, we encourage the Working Group that was created to reform the Council to persist in its search for a suitably reformed Council. Our task is made especially urgent by the realization that, despite our perseverance, the achievement of international peace and security remains a frustrating will- oâ-the-wisp. There are today more peacekeeping operations than the international community appears able or willing to sustain. Some have been reasonably successful, and, others appear to promise eventual settlement. Most, however, seem to be ending with little to show for the considerable investment of time and money. One can only conclude from these varying results that increasingly we will have to turn to preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-building to fully address and treat the root causes of tension. We are also constantly reminded that, notwithstanding the abatement in East-West tensions, the dangers of a nuclear catastrophe are still very real and present. It is impossible to guarantee, in an unstable world such as ours, that nuclear weapons will not be used, either intentionally or inadvertently. Only a complete prohibition of such weapons, binding upon all States, can reduce the risk of nuclear disaster. My Government therefore urges the international community to move swiftly to a total elimination of these weapons coupled with an undertaking to discontinue their production. At the same time, we must redouble our efforts to curb the flow of conventional weapons, which serves to fuel conflagrations in trouble spots throughout the world. We must also intensify our search for a collective system of security upon which all States can rely for protection. Peace, as has been so aptly said, is not the mere absence of war. True peace can only come if it is built on a foundation of sound economic and social development. The foremost obstacle to peace is poverty, which, when it can be borne no longer, explodes with a vengeance. It is imperative, therefore, that the problem of poverty be squarely addressed by the United Nations with a view to halving its incidence by the year 2015. Reaching this target will require concerted action by both developed and developing countries. The developed countries have a vested interest in the economic prosperity of developing countries, since they represent important markets for their exports. A renewal of the dialogue between the industrial and the developing nations is urgently needed to achieve 5 the eradication of poverty. My Government intends to make this a primary goal during this yearâs session of the Assembly. Notwithstanding the onerous debt obligations and a physical infrastructure which we are tackling as a priority, Guyana has come a long way in overcoming poverty and maximizing its full growth potential. Thus, we continue to rely heavily on external assistance for our economic development. We are therefore particularly concerned by the rapid diminution of resources made available for financing by both bilateral donors and multilateral agencies. While private investment flows have a role to play in the development process, they are still far too selective to be of benefit to weak economies. We need to be assured of the continued provision of official development assistance, sufficient investment flows, technological transfer and trade opportunities that would allow for adequate development. As we move into the next century, we have to recognize the reality that developing countries are extremely vulnerable to changes in the world economy. The present course of globalization and liberalization has led to marginalization of the poorer countries. Guyana is a case in point. We have returned to the democratic fold and have achieved fairly high growth rates despite structural adjustment programmes. But after a few years, we are now faced with a steep drop in prices of our main export commodities, the drying up of developmental aid, adverse global weather conditions and so forth. At the end of the day, our people face tremendous hardships. We are being told that growing investment is needed. We open our economies to work with the private sector for development, and we see investment being directed away from the poorer countries, making them incapable of modernizing their economies. There is a need for a global consensus to assist developing countries to complete their transition so that they can be equal players in the globalization process. The alternative is to continue to ignore the danger signals which are becoming more and more evident. And, as usual, the rich countries will be able to solve their problems, but will do so at the expense of the poorer countries. The gap between the poor and rich will become greater, and conflicts will continue. The narcotics trade, mass migration, international crime, poverty and other ills will put severe strains on new and restored democracies. As we have become painfully aware, threats to our environment also impinge on our peace and security. Global warming and climate changes have increased the vulnerability of small States such as Guyana to a wave of natural disasters. The El NiÃ±o phenomenon recently inflicted on our country a period of intense drought, taking a heavy toll on our economy. In our continuing efforts to develop our country and meet the needs of our people, especially those living in poverty, my country remains dedicated to the preservation of the environment and the sustainable development of our resources. We are concerned, therefore, that when we seek to exploit our forest and other resources for the benefit of our people, we face criticisms from those who accuse us of disregard for the environment. These reproaches are entirely ill-informed, if not mischievous. A land of abundant and pristine forests, Guyana runs no risk of deforestation. We have in fact put in place firm legislative and administrative arrangements to ensure the conservation of our natural resources. Moreover, under the Iwokrama rain forest project, we have set aside almost a million acres of these forests for research by the international community into the preservation of biodiversity and the sustainable use of the forests. The four pillars which I have listed â€” democracy, economic and social development, human rights and the elimination of poverty â€” are indispensable to the construction of peace. Events in the post-war period have not only confirmed this fact, but have also shown that the building of peace and development must be the work of the international community. Persuaded of the need for enhanced multilateralism, my Government is committed to the realization of the late President Cheddi Jaganâs vision of a new global human order. The thrust of his proposal sought to reduce the ever widening and dangerous gap which exists between countries in the North and those in the South. Recalling the Marshall Plan, which served to rebuild Europe from the ashes of the Second World War, Mr. Jagan argued for a similar enterprise to eradicate poverty, promote good governance and bring development to all peoples. Only through such enlightened cooperation can the world enjoy the blessings of peace. I wish, therefore, to renew his plea and to call for early agreement on the establishment of a more just and equitable system of international relations. With the necessary determination and effort, we can make the twenty-first century a golden age for all humanity. 6 I am pleased to express my sincere congratulations to Mr. Didier Opertti on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. As much as his election reflects the esteem in which he personally is held, it is also reflects our appreciation of the positive role played by his country, Uruguay, in the international arena. I am confident that his presidency will be an effective factor in achieving the objectives to which the international community today aspires. I would like to take this opportunity to convey to His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko, President of the Assembly at its fifty-second session, our appreciation and esteem for having conducted the Assembly?s work effectively, wisely and objectively. I am also pleased to express my appreciation and esteem to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, who is managing the affairs of the international Organization with high competence and experience, and who is making continuous efforts and persistent endeavours to achieve peace and security in today?s world, which continues to face many kinds of conflicts and various forms of crises and challenges. A hundred years ago this year, the late King Abdul Aziz Bin Abdulrahman Al-Saud began the initial stages of rebuilding and uniting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on the principles of tolerant Islamic beliefs. In that process of unification, the late King Abdul Aziz was also laying the groundwork of a modern State which combines, on the one hand, adherence to Islam as a belief, a system and a way of life and, on the other hand, advanced forms of development and modernization. Since then, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which adheres to the religion of Islam, has played a significant international role, because it follows a foreign policy which conforms to the fundamental principles of the United Nations and with the noble objectives for which the Charter was formulated. These are in accordance with Islamic law in matters pertaining to the conduct of relations between States. The eternal message of Islam unites and does not divide, establishes justice and does not inflict injustice, promotes equality and does not discriminate. It urges everyone to work and cooperate to propagate these sublime principles and to achieve security, peace and prosperity for all humanity. Abiding by these principles, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, since its establishment, has continued to believe in constructive dialogue and peaceful coexistence among nations and peoples. It endeavours to cooperate and to respect the principles of international law and international legitimacy, it rejects violence and terrorism in any shape or form, and it does not interfere in the affairs of others or allow others to interfere in its own affairs. 10 On the basis of the same principle, the Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Fahd Bin Abdul-Aziz Al-Saud, is intent on performing its role in the international arena in such a way as to assist in creating the most favourable conditions for realizing the aspirations of the international community to security, peace, stability and prosperity. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is proud that it was one of the original signatories of the San Francisco Charter, which founded the United Nations, and it is proud also that it constantly adheres to the principles and purposes of that Charter. It also consistently endeavours to put these principles and purposes into practice. On the basis of those considerations, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reaffirms that it earnestly supports the United Nations and its specialized agencies, for it views the Organization as a viable framework for cooperation among nations and peoples, an important forum for dialogue and understanding, and an effective means to settle disputes and defuse crises. My Government wishes to emphasize a basic fact: the ability of the Organization to play all its roles and to carry out all those tasks depends on the political will to put those Charter principles and provisions into practical effect. In this regard, my Government is well aware of the importance of modernizing the United Nations agencies to enable them to play their required role, and on a level that enables them to deal with the new developments in modern international relations. The Security Council, which bears primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, remains the focus of the various reform proposals that have been put forward. In this regard, my country?s point of view has been based on a deep conviction that any restructuring of the Security Council must be aimed at improving the Council?s ability to perform its role effectively, in accordance with the Charter, and at making more active in implementing its resolutions and in dealing with international crises. The Council must also cooperate with the General Assembly in a manner that achieves the required harmony and the desired objectivity. As we seek greater cooperation, we have to look to the lessons of history to identify the obstacles which the United Nations has faced and which have hindered it from enhancing the cooperation that has become a requirement for peace, stability and growth. We have to hold the countries which base their international relations on principles that contradict the Charter basically responsible for creating those obstacles, and to make use of the means contained in the Charter to oppose such practices. Insistence on violating the principles of the Charter and refusal to comply with the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council signal a blatant challenge to the Charter, which we must firmly confront in a manner that is consistent with its provisions and purposes. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in line with its objective of achieving peace, security and stability in the Middle East, has supported the peace process from the very beginning and participated as an observer in the Madrid Conference. It has also participated actively in the multilateral negotiations, and will continue to support the peace process in its international activities and contacts. In addition, the Arab countries, in conformity with the conclusions of the Arab Summit held in Cairo in June 1996, have unanimously adopted a firm position stipulating that peace is a strategic Arab option. This affirms that there has been no Arab retreat from that firm position. What is regrettable, and a cause of grave concern, is that, after a glimmer of hope for peace in the region and after the optimistic feelings that peace was possible, the peace process — which started in Madrid on the basis of the principles of international legitimacy, United Nations resolutions and the principle of land for peace — has suffered repeated setbacks at the hands of the present Israeli Government. This Government has endeavoured to pursue policies that are based on retreating from the principles of the peace process endorsed by the Madrid Conference, as well as from the agreements signed with the Palestinian National Authority, and it continues to refuse to resume negotiations with Syria at the point that had been reached previously. In striving to destroy the peace process, the Israeli Government has continued to build settlements on Palestinian lands in order to alter their character and create new realities. It is also adopting a policy of Judaizing Holy Jerusalem by planting more settlements in and around it, as well as annexing areas with Jewish settlers and emptying Jerusalem of its Arab residents. It also enacted a law to enlarge the municipality of Holy Jerusalem to include neighbouring settlements so as to preempt the negotiations on the final status of Holy Jerusalem. These Israeli practices have resulted in aborting the efforts of the international community to achieve a just and comprehensive peace based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and on the land- for-peace principle. Such practices have led the peace 11 process down a dead-end road. What we perceive of the behaviour of the present Israeli Government does not make us optimistic about the possibility of achieving the peace which the peoples of the region aspire to unless these practices are met by firm measures to compel Israel to completely implement its agreements with the Palestinians, respect the principles on which the peace process was founded and enter into serious negotiations with the Palestinian Authority, with Syria and with Lebanon. We urge the international community, and the United States of America in particular, to continue making all possible efforts to save the peace process and to act resolutely to stop Israeli tampering with the most sensitive issue in the peace process — Jerusalem, which should be dealt with on the basis of its being the most important case in the Arab- Israeli conflict. Adhering to the rules of international legitimacy and fulfilling commitments is the best way to achieve peace and security. If the present Israeli Government is serious in its efforts to achieve peace with the Palestinian side, all it has to do is to affirm its adherence to the provisions of the signed agreements and resume the negotiations on the unresolved issues. If the Israeli Government intends to achieve a state of mutual security with its neighbour, Syria, the Syrian Government has spared no effort in declaring its readiness to resume negotiations with Israel from the point at which such negotiations had stopped. As for tension and the cycle of violence in southern Lebanon, its end is contingent upon immediate Israeli withdrawal from that part of Lebanon and the western Bekaa valley in accordance with Security Council resolution 425 (1978). The position of the Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques towards Iraq has two fundamental bases: first, guaranteeing the comprehensive, total, indivisible and non-selective compliance by the Iraqi Government with the resolutions of international legitimacy; and secondly, insuring the preservation of the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Iraq, as well as alleviating the sufferings of the Iraqi people. Our feelings of pain and sorrow for the sufferings of the brotherly Iraqi people, because of the hard conditions which they endure, contribute to our insistence on Iraqi compliance with all relevant international resolutions in order to get the sanctions lifted. In this context, it is with deep sadness that we received the news of the Iraqi Government?s decision not to cooperate with the United Nations Special Commission established by the Security Council. This will result in the continuation of sanctions on Iraq. We call upon the Iraqi Government to annul that decision, and we stress that the quickest means for lifting the sanctions is faithful and meticulous responsiveness, in letter and spirit, to the requirements of the Security Council resolutions. The Iraqi Government should stop the policies of prevarication and delay aiming at impeding the implementation of these resolutions, especially those concerning the release of prisoners and detainees, the return of property, commitment to a modality for compensation and full cooperation with the efforts of the United Nations Special Commission to eliminate weapons of mass destruction. Saudi Arabia and its sisters, the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, place great importance on the bettering of relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. We have been particularly pleased at the recent positive indicators from the Iranian Government which could have a positive impact on Iranian-Gulf relations and on the climate of peace and stability in the region. In this connection, we welcome the positive implications — regarding both Gulf-Iranian relations and the issue of armaments in the statement by President Mohammad Khatami before the General Assembly last week. We look forward to resolving the outstanding problems between the two sides — foremost among which is the issue of the three United Arab Emirates islands, Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa — by peaceful means, in accordance with the principles of international law, including the option of referring the matter to the International Court of Justice. We also express our concern regarding the current tension between Iran and Afghanistan. We call upon these two countries to exercise restraint and resolve their dispute by peaceful means. The continuing fighting in Afghanistan during all these years is a cause of sadness and sorrow. Saudi Arabia has done all it could since the beginning of the fighting to stop the bloodshed and to restore peace and security to Afghanistan. We support the efforts of the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to stop the fighting. At the same time, we strongly deplore the manipulation of the present situation of Afghanistan to make it a haven for the sheltering and training of terrorists, which destabilizes security and brings further suffering to the Afghani people. Shortly after the Serbs terminated their aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, they ignited the flames of a new war, aiming this time at our brothers in Kosovo. The Serb forces are daily committing 12 in Kosovo the same inhuman practices which they perpetrated in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including ethnic cleansing, coerced deportation, terror and oppression in full view of the whole world. It would be truly tragic if silence in the face of these appalling actions was to continue over this long duration. Therefore we call upon the international community to shoulder its responsibilities by promptly taking all requisite measures to put an end to these practices. Terrorism, which is striking every corner of the world mercilessly and indiscriminately, has become a very serious international phenomenon and requires an international effort to combat it. The Government of Saudi Arabia has regularly condemned terrorism and has joined its efforts to other international efforts to confront it with all possible effectiveness. We stress in particular that terrorism and violence are universal phenomena rather than the characteristics of a certain people, race or religion. Precisely because of the comprehensiveness and universality of terrorism, the only way to combat it is through unified international action within the framework of the United Nations, with a view to ensuring an end to terrorism, saving the lives of the innocent and preserving the independence and sovereignty of States. But combating terrorism would also require international cooperation against sheltering terrorist elements and groups and preventing them from exploiting the territories and laws of the States in whose territories they live in order to practice their destructive activities, regardless of any pretexts. The conflict in Jammu and Kashmir remains a threat to peace and security in South Asia. We call for finding a peaceful solution to this problem in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions and for allowing the people of Jammu and Kashmir to exercise directly their legitimate right to self-determination. The Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques pays maximum attention to the ongoing efforts to eliminate weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, including the Arabian Gulf region. This is undertaken through its support of the efforts of the League of Arab States in accordance with the resolution adopted by the League?s Council during its 101st session which called for making this sensitive part of the world a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction: nuclear, chemical and biological. We are greatly concerned by Israel?s refusal to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Israel thus keeps its nuclear programmes outside the ambit of international inspection, which constitutes a serious threat to the region?s security and stability. While we completely reject the international community?s double standard that allows Israel an exception from nuclear disarmament efforts and thus encourages the arms race, we also express our concern at the nuclear tests carried out in South Asia, begun by India and followed by Pakistan, in view of the dangers these tests present to the security and peace of the region. While believing there is urgent need to increase the effectiveness of the NPT through the activation and universalization of the system of guarantees of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), we also consider it of the utmost importance to establish controls and criteria that would assist in achieving the desired progress in all fields of disarming weapons of mass destruction, in conformity with General Assembly resolution 1 (I) of 1946. In this context, we urge all States that have not yet done so to take the necessary steps as early as possible to accede to the NPT and place their nuclear installations under the international safeguards regime, thereby contributing to international peace and security. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia considers environmental issues and environmental protection of key importance, to the degree that it has assigned to them a prominent place in our domestic and foreign policies. We believe that a decent life for mankind is directly connected with environmental and climatic conditions. Therefore, the Kingdom has effectively participated in all relevant conferences, forums and international organizations concerned with environmental protection. In addition, we have become a party to several regional and international agreements relevant to this issue. We only hope that international efforts relating to the problems of the environment will be characterized by the necessary degree of balance and of objectivity, as based on serious and rational studies and buttressed by scientific facts that take into account the needs of development in the developing world. In this regard, we call upon all States to abide by Agenda 21. We also urge the industrial States in particular to live up to their obligations regarding the transfer of environmental technology to developing countries. The emerging forces of globalization and their seemingly rampant nature which cause geographic, political and sovereignty barriers to recede, force upon us the need to tame and channel these energies. Therefore, 13 we are now called upon more than at any other time before not to confront this phenomenon, but to act cohesively in its formulation, in conformity with our religious beliefs, our cultural and civilizational values, and in the interests of our peoples. This should also be accomplished in a manner that would accord with the diversity and pluralism of social and political systems that have prevailed after the bipolarism of the cold war. The objective would be to build a balanced world based on mutual interest, reciprocity of advantages and equality of opportunity to live free from fear, secure from hunger and poverty. It would be a world in which principles of justice, prosperity and peace predominate. It is important to stress, in this regard, that the principles of free world economies and open markets are not an end in themselves. They are but a means to growing the economies through the increase and expansion of exports. The developing countries cannot attain these objectives without greater flexibility in the varying opportunities afforded to them in the form of human resources, infrastructure, and financial, administrative and procedural regulations. Consequently, the developing countries are required more than ever before to intensify their internal development efforts in order to be integrated in the international economy. This calls for closer cooperation in international fora in order to deal with the issues of development and to draft a considered and comprehensive agenda that fulfils the ambitions and aspirations of the peoples of developing countries within the framework of the new economic order. In this context, we cannot ignore the important role that needs to be played by the developed countries, who must fulfil their international commitments to the developing and less developed countries either by direct or indirect aid as well as through cancellation and rescheduling of foreign debt. Developed countries must also allow free and easy access to their markets for the exports of developing countries and must refrain from adopting unjust trade measures that impede the flow of such exports to their markets. In this regard, it must be noted that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been very keen on contributing, within the limits of its means, to the development of developing countries, whether at the bilateral or multilateral levels. Because of its desire to participate in the efforts to achieve a better future for the international economy, Saudi Arabia has applied for membership in the World Trade Organization. God willing, and with the support of friendly countries, we hope to finalize the accession procedures as soon as possible. The issues just mentioned, with their political, economic, security and social dimensions, confirm the need for our Organization to assume its role in the maintenance of international peace and security and to realize the aspirations of all peoples to live in security and enjoy stability and prosperity. Our firm belief in the role that the United Nations can play in dealing with crises, as well as our efforts to avoid the horrors of war and to prepare for international cooperation, make us more determined than ever to support this Organization and emphasize its constructive role. The United Nations must have a larger role in dealing with crises before they occur by exercising preventive diplomacy in order to maintain stability and preserve international peace and security. We have great hopes that the Organization will continue its march towards these goals with strong steps and firm determination. I cannot find more suitable words to end my statement than this verse from the Holy Quran: “Work, soon Allah will observe your work, and His Messenger, and the Believers.” (The Holy Quran, IX:105)   It is my high honour to address the Assembly today, both as the Chairman of the South Pacific Forum and as the President of the Federated States of Micronesia. First of all, Mr. President, for the South Pacific Forum and for my country, I wish to express sincere congratulations on your election to the highest position one can hold in this body. We are confident that your strong experience and leadership will provide the rudder that is needed here to steer us safely through the many challenges that lie ahead. I also thank the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for his skilful guidance throughout the past year during most difficult and troubling times. Recognition also must be given to the Secretary- General, Mr. Kofi Annan, whose tireless and effective work in both leadership and coordinating roles is well known to all of us. The Federated States of Micronesia was honoured to host the twenty-ninth summit of leaders of the South Pacific Forum in Pohnpei on 24 and 25 August. As a result, I have the privilege and heavy responsibility of reporting to this organ the consensus achieved by all 16 member countries of the Forum at that summit. The South Pacific Forum is a unique institution involving independent and self-governing States which share a very special part of the world. Forum member countries differ greatly in land area, ocean area, population, resource endowment, economic development and industrialization, social structures, cultures and living standards. However, we all share a common bond as Forum members and have established agreed positions on a wide range of issues which transcend our diversity. We have also agreed to work together to pursue cohesion, stability and well-being in our countries. At the recent summit, the heads of Government and representatives of the 16 member countries reviewed progress and took decisions on a number of issues considered important to the region, which were generally of a political, economic or environmental nature. I will mention briefly some of the subjects that were discussed and refer for further details to the Forum communiqué, which is to be issued as a document of this General Assembly. The overall theme of the Forum?s summit this year was “From Reform to Growth: The Private Sector and Investment as Keys to Prosperity”. In this regard, the Forum agreed that efforts should be made to ensure macroeconomic stability by improving fiscal discipline, further promoting public sector reforms and broadening the tax base. It also emphasized the need to introduce a wide range of policy, legal, regulatory and institutional reforms which provide the private sector with a more favourable and competitive business environment. Leaders noted that good overall progress has been made in the implementation of the Forum Economic Action Plan, which aims at strengthening the economies of the island countries. This progress was made despite such difficulties as capacity constraints facing some members, the backdrop of region-specific difficulties, notably drought and other disasters, and the problems faced by member countries on account of the Asian economic crisis. Specific recommendations were endorsed concerning the region?s response to undesirable economic activities, the promotion of competitive telecommunications markets, the development of information infrastructure and work related to the Forum Free Trade Area. On a related matter, the Forum revisited the objective of having the United Nations adopt a vulnerability index, with the aim of having such an index included among the criteria for determining least developed country status and deciding eligibility for concessional aid and trade treatment. It was noted with pleasure that the United Nations Economic and Social Council had agreed to defer consideration of Vanuatu?s graduation from least developed country status for one year, pending further consideration of the vulnerability index issue, and that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have created a task force on the subject. While these steps have been important, much work remains ahead to gain full international recognition of vulnerability in its various manifestations as obstacles to the sustainable development of small island developing States. The Forum solidly reaffirmed its previous endorsement of the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States as a comprehensive framework with great potential for the region, and noted the efforts under way for its implementation, but that much remains unaddressed. It is believed that the special session of the General Assembly in 1999 to review the Plan of Action will represent an important opportunity for the region. Support was expressed for national, regional and transregional activities in the run-up to the special session, both to better position ourselves for effective participation and to raise pre-sessional awareness of the situation of small island developing States. One issue that received a great deal of attention at this year?s Forum summit was that of global climate change, and in particular the risk of sea level rise brought on or hastened by human activities affecting the atmosphere. The Forum?s membership includes two annex I parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. All the rest, including several which are not United Nations Members, are small island developing countries and committed members of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). We are driven in that regard by deep concerns about our very survival. It was encouraging and perhaps indicative to others that despite a wide diversity of interests on this issue the Forum succeeded in reaching a comprehensive position. The Forum recognized the legally binding commitments agreed to in the Kyoto Protocol as a significant first step forward on the path of ensuring effective global action to combat climate change. The Forum encouraged all countries to sign the Kyoto Protocol and to work towards its earliest possible ratification. In particular, noting that the Framework Convention obliges developed country parties to take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof, the Forum stressed the importance of implementing measures to ensure early progress towards meeting the commitments in the Kyoto Protocol. This applies particularly to the United States, 2 the European Union, the Russian Federation, Japan, Canada and other annex I emitters. The Forum called for substantial progress at the upcoming fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention in Buenos Aires in establishing the rules for international implementation mechanisms — particularly emissions trading, the clean development mechanism and joint implementation — to ensure that these mechanisms assist the effectiveness of greenhouse-gas reduction efforts. It was also noted that an effective global response to the problem of climate change will require ongoing active cooperation and strengthened action by all parties, taking account of their common but differentiated responsibilities and their respective capabilities. The Forum stressed the urgent need to initiate a process to develop procedures and future time-frames for wider global participation in emissions limitation and reduction in which significant developing country emitters would enter into commitments which reflect their individual national circumstances and development needs. But remember, developed countries must take the lead. The Forum noted with relief and gratitude the recognition in the Kyoto Protocol of the importance of the adaption needs of small island States. The leaders called for adequate resources to be generated through the implementation mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol and the Global Environment Facility for the full range of adaption measures. The Forum countries anticipate maximizing the benefits to them from such implementation measures and mechanisms through the work of another regional organization, the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme. Respectful of the wide range of reactions and emotions surrounding the outcome of Kyoto, and recognizing also the difficult challenges that will face the delegates at Buenos Aires, it is suggested that the Forum consensus should be taken as a harbinger of the possibilities for finding common ground on a larger playing field — one on which the ultimate fate of all of us may be decided. Before I leave the subject of climate change, I would like to express gratitude to the donor nations that responded recently to the suffering visited upon Pacific island peoples by the climatic phenomenon of El Niño. Whether or not scientists can decide conclusively that the recent intensity of the El Niño effect is a symptom of global climate change, it is a fact that entire island populations found themselves in a situation where their very survival depended on the willingness of other countries to provide emergency assistance. We will always be thankful that such assistance was forthcoming. While we express our appreciation, we are also mindful of the situation of the devastation that has been created by Hurricane Georges in the southern United States, and we are hoping and praying that this phenomenon will pass, giving relief to the people. Another issue of immediate and continuing environmental concern to our Forum region is the ongoing practice by industrialized Powers of shipping radioactive wastes back and forth through our economic zones in the advancement of their own national interests and priorities, irrespective of our strenuous and continuing protests. The Forum noted that some strides have been made in exchanging information on these shipments, but the risks remain. At the very minimum, we continue to seek a strong regime of prior notification to and consultation with coastal States on planned shipments of hazardous wastes, and the development of a regime to compensate the region for actual economic losses caused to tourism, fisheries and other affected industries in the area. The Forum leaders could not help but note with alarm the recent tests of nuclear devices by India and Pakistan. They expressed grave concern that the recent nuclear tests constitute a threat to the international process of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. It will be recalled that the region encompassed by the Forum members has perhaps greater standing than any other region in the world to express alarm over the continued testing of nuclear devices. The Forum members have endured and continue to endure the human suffering that has resulted from the curse of nuclear proliferation and testing. The Pacific island countries are taking action within the region to counter the presence of nuclear weapons and the testing of nuclear devices through the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. We call upon the United States to ratify that Treaty. Finally, as regards the South Pacific Forum — and I stress that I do not mention here every issue that was discussed or covered in the communiqué — I want to relate the Forum?s pleasure in drawing attention to the signing of the Noumea Accord between the Government of France and the concerned parties in New Caledonia. This Accord represents a tremendous accomplishment by 3 all involved in moving forward the process of self- determination for New Caledonia, whatever the ultimate outcome of that process might be. I have already consumed much of my time in commenting on issues that concern the South Pacific Forum as a group. Briefly now, I ask that you focus your attention on the situation of my small island developing country. The Federated States of Micronesia is approaching the end of the millennium with a sense of unsettlement. We will be among the first to celebrate the beginning of the new epoch, but, in an immediate sense, what does this celebration promise for us? Our developmental process began only a few years ago, and the barriers we face in terms of need for technology and manpower development, scarcity of resources, our remote location and small population — to name only a few — are beyond our capability to overcome alone. We are indeed fortunate to be receiving substantial assistance from the United States and other bilateral partners, but our long-term future cannot and should not depend upon bilateral assistance. Perhaps it is not realistic for us to plan for complete self-sufficiency, but we do want to become, and we must become, more self-reliant. We in the Federated States of Micronesia have some concerns that the emphasis of effort in the United Nations is being somewhat drawn away from the balance between addressing the overall interests of all countries and at the same time particularly assisting developing countries to move towards their rightful condition. In other words, we fear that the traditional role of the Organization in assisting less advanced countries with their development could be marginalized. I use the phrase “drawn away” because the shift to which I refer would not be something that leaders sat down and purposefully decided on. In large part, given the breadth of the Charter, the United Nations is simply in danger of becoming overwhelmed by its responsibilities. As regional and national conflicts proliferate, drug trafficking flourishes, terrorism looms as an ever more dangerous part of our daily lives, and as the global environment becomes increasingly threatened, the demands on the time and resources of this body and its Members to confront immediate problems are compelling. But while the need to move towards a closer parity between the living standards of the North and the South necessitates long-term solutions, it cannot be forgotten that in the long term the accomplishment of that goal will do much to address the problems to which I have just referred, which seem beyond the reach of immediate solutions. Meanwhile, as developing countries, we too must do our part. We must create the flexible, though outward- oriented, economies that can maximize the benefits of the global economy in which we also exist. At the same time, we must not forget that our national identities and unique national and subnational social, political and economic situations demand a proactive approach that avoids blindly jumping on the bandwagon of the latest development initiatives in order to reap the perceived benefits of donor assistance. In realizing that mistakes inevitably are made and opportunities lost, we must not lose our sense of self-confidence or permit ourselves to become overly prone to accepting the dictates of well- meaning donor partners whose understanding of our situation may not be complete. But we must also remain very alert to the need for course correction and we must endure periods of structural, institutional and even behavioural change. The process is now ongoing in my country. With the assistance of the Asian Development Bank and donor partners, we are well along in implementing a two- pronged programme that involves Government and public enterprise reforms, on the one hand, and private sector reforms, on the other. On the Government side, we are reorganizing and downsizing our institutions and improving our tax structure in order to move along the adjustment path to sustainable finances and rational service levels. On the private sector side, our reforms are designed to improve the economic environment for private sector growth, especially in those productive activities that earn dollars from abroad. This means, among other things, reducing the role of Government in productive activities and restructuring our legal and regulatory environment to encourage private sector activity and investment, especially foreign investment. Despite our determination to carry through this effort, we know that it alone will not produce development. It will facilitate development and make our application of development assistance far more effective. But now, perhaps more than ever, we will require the patience, understanding and continued support of donor partners and international institutions, which have been so instrumental in helping us to reach this point. This is to be a session during which two very important anniversaries are celebrated: 50 years of United Nations peacekeeping and 50 years of the Universal 4 Declaration of Human Rights. As to the first, I wish to honour those who served in the peacekeeping operations of the past 50 years, especially those who lost their lives in the service of the United Nations. As to the second, the vital role played by the Declaration hardly needs my endorsement; but I would refer to my statement at the 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human Rights, when, in speaking with respect to those who have given their lives in the cause of human rights, I said: “Those very heroes would be among the first to say, 'Let?s look into the past only for what we can learn from it. The job is not yet done, and our enemy grows stronger.'” It only remains for me to refer to the activities of the international community and this body having to do with my country?s predominant resource — the ocean. This is the International Year of the Ocean. The world can little afford to miss the opportunities presented by this occasion to focus on our planet?s most prevalent yet least understood physical mechanism. The single best example of that dangerously incomplete understanding surely is the ocean- generated, worldwide disaster of El Niño, which occurred, ironically, this year. For obvious reasons, the peoples of Micronesia secured involvement in the long negotiations that led to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea even before we emerged from Trusteeship status. We have continued that involvement as a party to the Convention and now call on all States to ratify the Convention and participate fully in the process. We support the Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, as well as resolutions aimed at eradicating the practice of driftnet fishing and unauthorized fishing in areas of national jurisdiction. We urge action to reduce by-catches, fish discards and post-harvest losses. Looking towards the Assembly?s special session on the Barbados Programme of Action, and also towards next year?s consideration of oceans by the Commission on Sustainable Development, we encourage the recognition of linkages between the various related issues and the need for more integrated treatment. By necessity, I speak of linkages and integration, which are familiar terms of usage within the United Nations system but there is nothing routine about the devastations of El Niño that were visited upon my country?s people earlier this year and upon other peoples around the world. I can think of no better example of the need for the recognition of linkages in terms of ocean and climatic issues and the necessity for the application of integrated response measures. In closing, I should like to refer to the fact that, in recent years, as the problems of our increasingly complex and globalized society appear to have escalated, it has become fashionable in some quarters to question whether the United Nations Organization is worth maintaining. It is as though the world?s peoples expect that the worth of this Organization is to be tested by its efficiency in “fixing” a set of global problems, after which, presumably, we would all live happily ever after. That mistaken notion is grounded in the assumption that international cooperation exists only for immediate problem-solving. Speaking for a relatively new Member country of the United Nations, allow me to suggest humbly that the repetition of mistakes of whatever scale and the creation of new crises along with every step forward is elemental to the human condition. The Charter of this Organization, monumental as it may be, is still a document designed by and for human beings on this planet and must be judged and applied in light of the human experience. The United Nations should not be expected to work itself out of a job. The people and the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia deeply respect the past accomplishments of the United Nations and look forward to continuing to meet our commitments to it, even though our contributions may appear small.  Mr. President, your election to preside over the fifty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly is especially gratifying for us Brazilians. Brazil and Uruguay came into being as sister nations, and our bonds are becoming ever stronger. With each passing day, our destinies are more and more linked together. The opportunity I have of working closely with my friend, Didier Opertti, allows me to say with conviction that at this session the Assembly will have a formidable President. In the exercise of this important task, you will benefit from the example set by your predecessor. At the helm of the fifty-second session, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko was able to guide and motivate delegations and to provide valuable impulse to the proposals for reform put forward by the Secretary- General. Because of his dedication to the task of modernizing our Organization and, above all, because of his decisive role in situations that pose a real threat to international peace and security, the Secretary-General deserves our applause. The diplomatic talent and serene daring revealed by Mr. Kofi Annan confirm that we have in him a leader who is up to the challenges and opportunities before us. It was an honour for us to have welcomed him in Brazil this past July. The defining trait of this particular moment is the troubling instability that besets global financial markets. Since the last quarter of 1997, when we first felt the shock waves of what was then called the “Asian crisis”, the world economy has been suffering the effects of a phenomenon whose reach, depth and permanence are still not clear. But the international community cannot wait, with arms crossed, for the course of events to shed light on our quandary. It is both legitimate and necessary that Governments act to try to prevent problems that may arise. In an era marked by the rapid integration of national economies, such action by Governments will increasingly have to be made through coordination in the international sphere. Although there is still no consensus as to the dimension of the crisis we face, nor on the prognosis for its duration, there seems to be a growing convergence of points of view regarding the impact of the high volatility of capital movements. The events of the past few months 5 have revealed a serious lag between growing financial interdependence and the modest effectiveness of existing international mechanisms for dialogue and coordination. Since the beginning of his Administration, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil has been calling the attention of other world leaders to the task of making the global financial system more stable and predictable. In repeated messages to G-7 members, beginning in 1995, he offered concrete proposals: to increase cooperation among monetary authorities; to expand coordination of macroeconomic policies among countries that can have considerable impact on world finance; to upgrade international monitoring capacity over domestic macroeconomic policy; and to expand mechanisms aimed at stabilizing currencies under speculative attack. There have been, of course, considerable advances along some of these lines, but the measures adopted still fall far short of what is needed. Until now, political will has not corresponded to the magnitude and gravity of the situation. The crisis will not resolve itself. We must join together to face it. In this, as in other fields of international life, we must avoid at all costs an attitude that, back in the seventies, Brazilian Foreign Minister Azeredo da Silveira described as “the postponement syndrome”. Experience teaches us that inaction can have a high cost. It also teaches that answers given by various countries to crisis situations, if guided by irrational or spur-of-the- moment reactions, can turn these situations into even greater problems, prolonging their effects over time and aggravating people’s suffering. One can imagine extreme scenarios of a return to closed economic models, to the search for elusive self- sufficiency and isolation, to notions of national security based on distrust of others and on the insecurity of others. Such scenarios must not become reality. We cannot allow it. Progress in international relations depends fundamentally on the perception of the international arena not as a source of potential threat, but as an environment in which risks can be reduced and difficulties overcome by a pooling of wills and resources. Ours is not a world in which nations should be left to their own devices. The cost of such a course is invariably higher than the energy or resources saved by attempts to distance oneself from the problems of others. The willingness to deal collectively with problems will motivate individual countries to believe in the benefit of seeking international consideration of matters in their direct interest. The world cannot depend only on the willingness, capacity and interest of a select number of countries to mobilize and lead international efforts in this or that direction. We can no longer accept situations, such as the present financial crisis, in which, despite the undeniably international nature of the phenomenon, Governments and societies simply do not fully trust any of the existing organizations or mechanisms as a source of support, guidance or even interpretation of the problem at hand. We must give serious consideration to the fact that growing interdependence renders indispensable effective governance at the international level. We have before us an essentially political challenge. This does not mean simply modernizing decision-making procedures or administrative structures, but also giving to multilateral treatment of issues the priority it so often receives in our speeches and statements. A large gap still remains between the recognition that the central problems facing humanity must be dealt with at the international level and the resistance of Governments and societies to act in accordance with that recognition. This is most evident in the allocation of resources and in the adoption of policies capable of generating external repercussions. In that same vein, if the link between the national and the international is ever greater, peace and development are also increasingly related. A world racked by economic instability or despair cannot be a safe environment, free of the threat of war, conflict and violence. But the reverse is also true: material and social progress presupposes minimal conditions of security and peaceful coexistence among and within countries. We must advance on both fronts by working to establish a climate of confidence in the political-strategic realm and in the essential context of the global economy. Brazil’s relative weight and the history of our international behaviour are some of our country’s most important credentials. These credentials are strengthened today by the maturity of our democracy and by the vigorous modernization of the Brazilian economy. Under the leadership of President Cardoso, we have renewed our permanent willingness to play a more active 6 role in building a world order conducive to peace and development. This spirit guides Brazil’s international action, particularly within the United Nations. I wish to point out that, in the Security Council and other United Nations bodies, our delegation, led by Ambassador Celso Amorim, has faithfully reflected this central guideline of Brazilian foreign policy. In 1998, we have completed our participation in the international non-proliferation regime. We have ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which was approved by Brazil’s National Congress this past July. Three days ago in Washington, I had the satisfaction of personally depositing the instrument of accession to the NPT, in tandem with our Ambassadors in London and Moscow. These decisions lend formal and symbolic support to the commitment to use nuclear energy for exclusively peaceful purposes. This commitment is enshrined in the Brazilian Constitution and is strengthened by the bilateral and regional pacts we have signed. The existing agreements and the cooperation between Brazil and Argentina, as well as the Treaty of Tlatelolco, are exemplary achievements in this field. Brazil thus feels particularly motivated to call upon nuclear-armed States, and upon those with the capability of producing such weapons, to take decisive steps towards disarmament. We also expect that Governments which have still not become party to the NPT, the CTBT and other relevant instruments and mechanisms will do so at an early date. As an expression of the determination which motivates us to work for this cause, Brazil, together with seven other friendly countries, signed the “Declaration on a Nuclear Weapon Free World: the Need for a New Agenda” on 9 June of this year. During the current session of the General Assembly, together with our partners in the Declaration, we intend to present a draft resolution aimed at boosting and guiding efforts towards the complete and definitive elimination of nuclear weapons. There is no longer room or justification for postponing action in the nuclear field or in the broader fight to eliminate all weapons of mass destruction. The cost of a failure to do so could be truly catastrophic, and the risks are evident to all. The Brazilian Government, as the coordinator of the guarantor countries of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol, has been making a sustained effort to assist Ecuador and Peru in reaching at the earliest possible date a solid and final agreement on the border differences that have kept them apart for decades. Our diplomatic services — together with those of Argentina, Chile and the United States — stand ready to continue making the best possible contribution. Recent developments confirm the prognosis that the peace process is on its way to a conclusion and reflect the political will and the high level of engagement with which Ecuador and Peru have been working towards that end. The fact that South America is a region in which countries essentially live in a harmonious, peaceful and increasingly integrated manner is for Brazil a vital and defining trait that our peoples are determined to preserve. The same applies to the permanence of democratic regimes as a common thread of the nations in our continent. It is a higher value to which we are collectively committed in the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), the Rio Group and the Organization of American States (OAS). The advent and consolidation of democracy was the determining factor in the extraordinary work of integration in which South American nations are engaged. This is an accomplishment of our societies that the Governments of the region must always be prepared to defend as one. This is a basic tenet of Brazilian foreign policy. Brazil attaches the utmost importance to the advancement of human rights. As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we should recognize the persistent gap between principles and generally accepted rules of international law, on the one hand, and the prevalent realities of the world, on the other. The Brazilian Government is engaged in the fight to overcome the distance between norms and facts in our country. We are prepared to draw from the international environment elements that may help us realize an aspiration shared by all Brazilians. This was the main thrust of President Cardoso’s submission to the National Congress of the decision to recognize the mandatory jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. 7 President Cardoso is also committed to the fight against the drug trade. His presence at the special session of the General Assembly this past June was clear proof of this commitment. Our participation in the effort to build a lasting peace extends beyond the Americas. The Brazilian military and police have taken part in United Nations forces in many parts of the world, particularly in Portuguese-speaking countries in Africa, to which we are bound by history and culture. Brazil has followed developments in Angola with concern. The United Nations must firmly insist that UNITA fulfil the commitments undertaken in the Lusaka Protocol. An unravelling of the situation could jeopardize the progress achieved in the peace process and would be tragic indeed. Angolans have been subjected to untold suffering for decades. The international community must do everything within its reach so that Angola may finally dedicate itself to reconstruction and development. The Brazilian Government, along with the other members of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, is engaged in seeking a peaceful solution to the grave internal crisis faced by Guinea-Bissau. The Community, in close coordination with countries in the region, has contributed to spurring significant progress. We will continue to pursue favourable conditions for the urgent and complete normalization of life in that sister nation. As for East Timor — to which we are also bound by history and a common language — Brazil welcomes the new spirit that presides over this delicate and complex issue, especially in the context of the tripartite negotiations between the Portuguese and Indonesian Governments, under the auspices of the Secretary-General. The Brazilian Government has maintained a positive dialogue with the parties involved and is determined to assist, to the limit of its possibilities, in finding an adequate equation for all concerned, with progressive participation by the Timorese themselves. Since the advent of economic stability in 1994, Brazil has shown renewed dynamism with the strengthening of our domestic market and the outlook for development with social justice. But present-day Brazil does not see its development as isolated or self-contained. We realize that the destiny of our economy is increasingly linked to that of the economies of our neighbours and partners, in the framework of an integration process that has decidedly contributed to progress in the region and to the well-being of our societies, particularly within MERCOSUR. The fruits of this process serve not only the goal of economic development but also, and most importantly, the cause of social justice, which remains the foremost task of our region. We welcome the results of the most recent edition of the United Nations Human Development Report. The numbers show that, in spite of all that remains to be done, our country has made extraordinary social progress over the past two decades in the areas of health, education, the fight against poverty and the reduction of disparities among the various regions of the country. Even though we still face daunting challenges, Brazilians are leading a better life, as our presence among those nations of greater human development indicates. Consistent with its domestic policies and its regional role, Brazil will continue to fight for a more balanced allocation of the benefits of economic interdependence, without distortions such as those resulting from protectionist policies of developed countries. Such policies affect in a particularly cruel manner the developing countries and serve to reinforce the arguments of those who preach domestically a return to closed economic models. In the current context of global economic turbulence, we must demand that the developed countries establish greater coherence between free-trade rhetoric and their unfair trade practices. President Cardoso has stated that we must abandon the path of globalization with exclusion — in the decision-making process as well as in the distribution of benefits — and seek globalization with solidarity in both of those dimensions. Reforming and strengthening the United Nations is an essential part of building a world of greater solidarity. The Brazilian Government recognizes the significant progress that has already been made in terms of structural and functional modernization of the Organization. We agree with the Secretary-General when he says that reform must not be seen as an event, but as a process; but we cannot but stress that an important part of that process has yet to be undertaken. 8 For Brazil, reforming the United Nations necessarily implies updating the functioning and composition of the Security Council, which still mirrors a period of history that is now long gone. That does not mean — and I have stated this before in this forum — that the particular interests of this or that country should be taken into account. What it does mean is that fundamental deficiencies in terms of legitimacy, representativeness and effectiveness must be redressed. We will continue to defend expansion in both categories of members, with the presence, in both, of developing countries. It is inconceivable that, on the eve of the new millennium, reform of the Organization could exclude the restructuring of the Security Council. The basis of global solidarity is the establishment of trust between societies. There is no other way if we are to establish a peaceful, stable and constructive international environment. Our so-called global village is still far from becoming a truly integrated community, in which people can consider themselves as participants in the same historical process. Of the many merits of international organizations, one of the most important is that they offer a framework of interaction that favours the development of a true sense of universal communion. In dealing with common problems, Governments learn in practice just how much they need to work more and more closely together. In international forums, we are constantly weaving a web of relations based on a stronger identity and trust between our nations and their leaders. Countries must trust one another, but they must also have a reason to trust in the legitimacy and efficiency of multilateral organizations and procedures in order to tackle their most important problems. The dynamics of international life demand a constant updating of the instruments at the disposal of the community of nations to allow it to act collectively in the face of its greatest challenges. We must have the courage to recognize that never before have the risks and the cost of procrastination been so high. We must, above all, have the will to make the decisions that can ultimately restore our faith in ourselves, in our capacity to state that history does goes on, and that we are pointing it in the direction of a more just and better world.   Let me start by congratulating Mr. Didier Opertti on his election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. In the same breath, I thank his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for the able manner in which he conducted the work of the fifty-second session. I also wish to express my delegation?s sincere appreciation to our brother, the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his wise leadership of the United Nations and for his exceptional report on the work of the Organization. We are gathered here once again to review the international situation. The fifty-second session of the Assembly had before it the document submitted by the Secretary-General entitled “Renewing the United Nations: a programme for reform”. The debate on that item was as serious as it was animated. It became clear that the United Nations in its present form is unable to respond to the realities of the present world order, much less to the exigencies of the new millennium. For the United Nations to do so, it must reinvent itself, and become more democratic, efficient and, of course, financially stable. This would befit an Organization created to serve the demanding needs of humankind through its impact on economic and social development, especially in the developing countries. Zambia would like to reiterate that the development mandate of the United Nations must be given priority and prominence in the reform process. Furthermore, after the issue of reform was debated last year, it was made clear that the critical financial situation of the United Nations was itself a major stumbling block to the Organization?s efforts not only to reform itself, but to address the priorities it has set itself to accomplish. We therefore reiterate our call for arrears owed to the United Nations to be paid in full, on time and without preconditions. The reform of the Security Council is without doubt the core issue which must be addressed, with a view to making the Council more democratic. Essentially, the Council must be enlarged to enhance its credibility and at the same time to reflect the universal character of the United Nations; this would remove the imbalances that characterize the present composition of the Council. To this end, the Zambian delegation wishes to reiterate the call made at the twelfth Summit of the Countries of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in Durban, in neighbouring South Africa, that expansion of the Security Council should be by no less than 11 new seats, based on the principle of equitable geographical distribution and, of course, bearing in mind the sovereign equality of Member States. Zambia further reiterates its support for the demand that the regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean should now have permanent seats on an expanded Security Council. With specific regard to Africa, my delegation wishes to reaffirm the decision taken at the summit of heads of State of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Harare in 1997 that five seats, of which two permanent, should be allocated to the African continent and that, in a 26-member Security Council, the African seats should be rotated in accordance with the agreed criteria of the African Group. My delegation further wishes to reiterate the common view that the veto power in the Security Council is a mere anachronism. It must be restricted and ultimately eliminated. In the field of international peace and security, the need for disarmament in all its aspects is as urgent as ever. To be sure, the lure of nuclear-weapons possession has become even stronger and the use of conventional weapons, particularly small arms, is prevalent in the world today. To put an end to nuclear-weapons proliferation, the nuclear-weapon States have a major responsibility to lead the international community towards nuclear disarmament, particularly in the Conference on Disarmament. The Conference must establish an ad hoc committee to begin negotiations on a phased programme for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons within a specified time- 27 frame. The nuclear-weapon States should also lead the international community in sustained efforts to conclude a nuclear weapons convention. Furthermore, Zambia believes that the time is now overdue for the convening of the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, which would offer an opportunity for a thorough review and assessment of the implementation of the provisions of the Final Document of the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, held in 1978. Allow me at this juncture to turn to the situation in our region, with specific reference to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola and, of course, Lesotho. With regard to the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, I want to confirm that Zambia, through its President, Mr. Frederick Chiluba, has been actively involved in the search by all regional leaders for a lasting and peaceful solution. The leaders of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), under the able leadership of President Mandela of South Africa and other regional leaders, have done a commendable job in this regard — of course, under very difficult circumstances. As we are all well aware, the maintenance of international peace and security is the primary responsibility of no other body than this Organization and its Security Council. There is no doubt, therefore, that the situation in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo, if unresolved, could pose a threat not only to the region, but also to international peace and security. The mediation efforts of SADC and other regional leaders therefore deserve the support of the international community in order to forestall the threat to international peace and security which the crisis poses. The situation in Angola has continued to worsen, despite the patience and efforts of the international community to bring Africa?s oldest civil war to an end. Zambia, as a neighbouring country and as host to the peace talks which finally resulted in the signing of the Lusaka Protocol in November 1994, is extremely concerned about the regression in the Angolan peace process. While the anger and disappointment of the international community are understandable and justified, it would not be advisable for us, at this moment, to abandon the peace process in Angola. We have come this far after long and painstaking efforts and invested a great amount of resources in the Angolan peace process. We cannot afford now to abandon the Angolan people, who have suffered so much and whose hopes were pinned on the Lusaka Protocol. We hope, therefore, that in spite of the setbacks, the international community, through this body, will reassert its authority and use its immense wisdom to put the Angolan peace process back on track. Zambia wishes to recognize the very noble and professional efforts of our brother, the late Alioune Blondin Beye, in this process. He died without seeing his efforts result in peace and stability in Angola. May his soul rest in peace. It is important, however, to ensure that his efforts were not in vain by working harder ultimately to bring durable peace to Angola. My country is also concerned about recent developments in Lesotho. As a member of SADC, Zambia is fully in support of the role which that organization is playing in trying to bring about a peaceful settlement. In this regard, we wish to appeal to the international community to give necessary support to the SADC efforts, spearheaded by Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe. It is now common knowledge that Africa as a whole has begun to make significant economic and political progress in recent years. However, in many parts of the continent, progress remains threatened or, indeed, impeded by conflict. United Nations records show that, since 1970, more than 30 wars have been fought in Africa alone, the vast majority of them intra-State in origin. In this regard, my delegation wishes once again to congratulate our brother, Secretary-General Kofi Annan, for his excellent report to the Security Council last April on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa, which is essentially a blueprint for resolving Africa?s numerous and complex woes by charting a course for peace and development. In the area of peacekeeping, Africa has already put in place the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution to resolve its own conflicts on the continent. We salute the efforts of Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary-General of the OAU, in this direction. We urge the international community and the General Assembly to support the Mechanism in order for it to function effectively and to the benefit of Africa. The spectre of international terrorism has assumed a dangerous momentum of its own. It does not discriminate between combatants and non-combatants. The brunt of it 28 all is in fact borne more by innocent bystanders. The acts of terrorism that rocked our sister republics of Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa, and the subsequent retaliatory action on Sudan and Afghanistan, have struck a cord in all of us, without exception. At issue is the unnecessary loss of human life. To protect human life, the international community should seriously address itself to the root causes of terrorism. The hour has now come for the full implementation of the General Assembly Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism contained in resolution 49/60, and the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings adopted at the fifty- second session. This Assembly must waste no time in its urgent conclusion and effective implementation of a comprehensive international convention on combating terrorism. We are happy to note that the United Nations Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court, which was held in Rome, Italy, this year, adopted the Court?s Statute. This is a powerful instrument of justice that the international community has given to itself and generations to come. My delegation is pleased that the crime of aggression falls within the jurisdiction of the Court, although the Court shall only have jurisdiction over the crime once a definition and the conditions under which the Court shall do its work are agreed upon. In this regard, we look forward to a quick resolution of this matter, since resolution 3314 (XXIX) contains most of the elements for definition of the crime of aggression. Considering what the world has witnessed in our sister republic of Rwanda and in the former Yugoslavia, we welcome the inclusion, under war crimes, of cases of armed conflict not of an international character. Let me now, on behalf of my delegation, turn to the world economy, which is becoming more integrated. Globalization and liberalization are indeed the current economic wave, and will continue in years to come. They have, however, far-reaching implications, in particular for the developing countries, as reflected in the current international financial confusion or turmoil. The United Nations faces the great challenge of coming up with initiatives to manage globalization and liberalization in such a manner that they benefit the entire community of nations, without exception. Processes of globalization and liberalization that undermine development are not in the interests of the international community. The external debt problem is yet another issue that impacts negatively on the economic and social development of many developing countries, Zambia included. We can recall a number of initiatives put in place to resolve this particular problem, but so far none seem to be effective, including the present Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative, which not only has targeted too few developing countries but also has a long transition period before eligibility is granted. It would, however, be a grave oversight to fail to acknowledge the commendable efforts of our brother, the Secretary-General, in this area. Zambia welcomes the uniform and strong endorsement by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development of the Secretary-General?s proposals to liberalize and assess the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative and convert all remaining official debt owed by the poorest African countries, Zambia included, into grants. We also welcome his other proposals which received similar endorsement by the Development Assistance Committee. Adverse weather patterns continue to bring into sharp focus how fragile the global environment is. The recent destruction of life and property by Hurricane Georges in some countries of the Caribbean and four States in the United States of America adds to the ravages of flooding in China and Bangladesh this year. This Assembly will recall that a year earlier Europe faced similar flooding, while certain parts of Eastern and Southern Africa faced a combination of flooding and drought. All these are reminders to the international community to meet the challenges caused by climate change and other adverse environmental factors and we reiterate our call to the international community to promote environmental sustainability with renewed commitment. Transnational deflationary forces are threatening global economic stability. In this uncertain outlook, the fortunes of many countries are under constant threat. For Africa, which is just emerging from the lost decade of the 1980s, the emerging global economic turmoil will add new strains to the process of promoting economic growth and development. Indeed, it is already clear that concern about the emerging global economic turmoil neglects the challenges facing Africa, as if to reaffirm its marginalization in the world economy. 29 In a spirit of interdependence, we in Africa call upon the international community not to overlook and forget the challenges of Africa. Africa needs a conducive international environment that will contribute to resolving the continent?s external debt crisis, growing poverty, slow export growth and other impediments to its development. In this regard, we are pleased to note that Japan will soon be convening the Second Tokyo International Conference on African Development. We salute Japan. And we hope this forum will offer an opportunity to relaunch the dialogue on African development. Zambia, like many other developing countries, has been implementing a very painful structural adjustment programme anchored on macroeconomic stabilization, privatization and, of course, commercialization. The policies we have undertaken have been critical to boosting and sustaining economic growth and development. Over the past few years Zambia has undergone a remarkable transformation. We have an open economy driven by the private sector. In the second generation of economic reforms that we are embarking upon our major focus is on the reduction of poverty by 50 per cent by the year 2004. We invite the international community to come and play a role in our economic programme. Let me conclude by stating that Zambia believes that, as we stand on the threshold of the new millennium, we all have a collective responsibility in this community of nations to chart a new course to strengthen our Organization. We need a strong United Nations to meet the exacting demands of the future. By strengthening it, we all strengthen ourselves. Zambia pledges to be a positive partner in this noble endeavour. I thank the Assembly for listening to me. I thank those representatives — most of those present — who nodded their heads in appreciation. I thank my brothers and sisters from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) for being with me.  On behalf of the Republic of San Marino and on my own behalf, I wish, first of all, to congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti on his election as President of the General Assembly and to wish him all success in his work. I also wish to assure him and the Secretary-General of the full support of my Government for their unceasing and valuable efforts. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for his work as President during the last session of the General Assembly. 1998 is an historic year for our Organization. We are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which has always been, and today remains, a milestone for democracy and for the safeguard of the inalienable rights of human beings. The Republic of San Marino, during the more than 16 centuries of its existence, has always promoted respect for human rights. Today more than ever before, the principles contained in the Declaration represent the essence of a civilized way of living together in modern society. Therefore my Government decided to finance the project of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights entitled “Global Dissemination of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights”. This project aims at making the Declaration accessible and understandable to a wider number of people, by preparing a compendium of translations of this important text into 250 of the world’s most widely spoken languages. With this small but meaningful gesture, San Marino wishes to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration and to make a contribution to the dissemination of the fundamental humanitarian principles contained therein. Experience has taught us, at a high cost, that where there is no peace, there is no respect for human rights. I believe the United Nations should play an active role in the maintenance of peace, especially where it is weakest and most precarious. This is vitally important. It should be the personal responsibility of every human being to carry out his or her own duty in the context of the international community. Sadly, we have recently once again confronted another dramatic issue: the problem of terrorism. We must all cooperate to prevent it from spreading any farther. We must combat terrorism and condemn it, always and by all possible means. Nuclear tests in the Asian region are a new and worrying problem, one that is going to be characteristic our era. This problem could represent the beginning of a new season of anxiety and danger for all mankind if the international community, and the United Nations in particular, is unable to prevent it. The Republic of San Marino, like many other States, is against any initiative aimed at provoking an escalation of the nuclear threat and will do all in its power to prevent this from happening. Our generation, and the ones to come, must not know these fears or the destructive ambitions that could annihilate our entire planet. Unfortunately, in our opinion the present international legal instruments have proven insufficient to fight the proliferation of nuclear weapons. This proliferation has taken on a new profile because of the will to acquire a more influential and prestigious position at the national and international levels, while the peaceful and constructive uses of this energy are forgotten or deliberately denied. My country deems that the United Nations must lead the international community to strengthen those instruments capable of preventing and repressing international crimes which until now have merely been the object of moral condemnation. With this in mind, our Republic took part in the Diplomatic Conference on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court in Rome last June and July. San Marino contributed to the work of the Conference because it is convinced that such a court could represent an effective and strong deterrent to crimes against peoples or any ethnic group. The court established by this Conference will represent not only a hope for but also an instrument of protection for the victims of oppression, as well as a point of reference for all those who believe in the absolute value of justice and in respect for human beings. San Marino follows with particular attention the debate on the death penalty. Our civil and cultural consciousness entitles us to do so. In 1865, San Marino became the first country in Europe to abolish capital punishment, though in fact it had not been applied for centuries. The Government and people of San Marino deeply believe that death imposed by law cannot represent 19 a valid protection for society, nor can it be a deterrent to crime. Our criminal code, in which sanctions have a rehabilitative as well as a punitive function, rejects capital punishment, defining it as “a residual of vindictive justice”. For these reasons, I wish to express the support of the Republic of San Marino for all initiatives that, like the resolution adopted this year by the Commission on Human Rights, aim at the abolition or limitation of the death penalty. The nations of the world differ geographically, ethnically, economically and culturally, but all of them have a common substantial and undeniable responsibility towards young people. If we are not able today to put an end to wars and poverty, future generations will have to fight arduous and complex battles arising from the degeneration and wounds that currently afflict humanity, as it moves towards the third millennium. It is a question not only of doing away with age-old geopolitical imbalances but, and primarily, of rediscovering values and principles that are capable of offering all people of the world, and especially young people, the cultural means to fight for freedom, development and mutual understanding. That is a challenge based on solidarity and personal values. Given that perspective, San Marino considers the moral and professional growth of young people to be a priority. Our school system is based on personal development, focuses on the job market and respect for environment and encourages young people to take part in the social lives of their communities. The need for reform in the United Nations is a concept widely shared by all Members of this Organization, thanks in particular to the input of the Secretary-General, who started a slow but irreversible process which will lead to the rationalization and updating of all its principal organs. Some of those reforms, such as the reform of the Security Council, must, because of their significance, be approved by consensus only — a consensus that sadly is yet to be reached. We have confidence in the steadfast commitment of the President of the General Assembly and in his substantial role in leading the Working Group on the reform of the Security Council to an equitable and unanimous solution that fully respects the principles of the Charter. San Marino is among those countries that are strongly convinced of the need for reform so as to guarantee for the United Nations the functions and the role that form the basis of its nature and its existence. We are absolutely aware of how important it is for the Organization to strengthen its presence and its prestige, which derive from more than 50 years of activity in the service of peace and the protection of human rights. We are moreover convinced that this noble mandate has today its own raison d’être, and that it must be supported with determination, consistency and loyalty. We should also have the courage and humility to be able to give up something in the name of the higher interest of all countries and all peoples who form part of the international community.  I have the pleasure of congratulating you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. We are confident that your wide-ranging expertise in international affairs will facilitate your task and lead the deliberations of this session to a successful conclusion. I should like also to thank your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his wise leadership and invaluable contributions during the preceding session of the Assembly. Nor can I fail to express our thanks and appreciation to the Secretary- General of our Organization, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the efforts he is exerting to enhance the role of the United Nations in international affairs. Following the end of the cold war a decade ago, many, especially in the countries of the North, believed that this planet, which is home to approximately 6 billion people, was going to become a more stable, secure and prosperous world. That conviction proceeded from the notion that the bi-polar system was unable to achieve international security except in the framework of a balance of terror. Nor was the old system able to resolve regional conflicts due to competition for areas of influence. The question now before the international community is the following: were these convictions justified? Or did wishful thinking leapfrog reality, ignoring the following salient facts? First, nuclear weapons, which are unparalleled in their destructive capability, have proliferated since the end of the cold war and have now reached India and Pakistan. This proliferation has also gained a sort of legitimacy based on the fact that Israel?s possession of nuclear weapons was not spoken of during the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. My country, Syria, Arab countries and most countries in the Non- Aligned Movement appealed to the five nuclear-weapon States during the review and extension conferences for this Treaty not to exempt any country from adhering to this Treaty, so that the world will not face a new nuclear arms race. Unfortunately that urgent call fell on deaf ears. Those who now assume that nuclear-arms proliferation will be limited to a few countries are mistaken. Syria and 10 all Arab countries call for turning the Middle East into a nuclear-weapon-free zone, as a serious contribution to halting the nuclear-arms race. Secondly, in the post-cold-war era regional conflicts have multiplied, becoming more fierce, and with varying forms and motives. This has happened to such an extent that the United States, which is now the only super-Power in a unipolar world, and the Security Council, the body responsible for maintaining international peace and security, are no longer able to contain these conflicts, let alone find just solutions to them. Anyone who reads the statement issued by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the five permanent members of the Security Council, issued at the beginning of this session of the General Assembly, will have a headache and will be severely frustrated at seeing this world face so many regional conflicts and so many complicated crises without any light at the end of the tunnel. Thirdly, we have the recent economic and financial crises in the world, particularly following the collapse of financial markets in South-East Asia and the accompanying sharp decline in the prices of raw materials, especially oil. All of this has proven that economic globalization is a two- edged sword and has repercussions which cannot be confined to those countries tantalized by rapid prosperity generated by an inflow of capital and foreign investments. Rather, such effects go beyond those countries to the countries exporting capital and investments, which were also tempted by quick profits without paying much heed to the consequences. What is going on in the world now under the banner of globalization is a cause for concern, because it gives priority to profit over other development factors: economic, social, cultural and environmental. It also strives to confine the role of the State to providing guarantees and protection to major market forces, ignoring the responsibility for the achievement of social justice for the peoples. Furthermore, the continuing marginalization of developing countries in international economic decision-making and the continuing severe restrictions on access by such countries to international markets and financial and technological resources render these countries unable to benefit from the promised opportunities of globalization. Strengthening development indicators and increasing levels of productivity are the more durable means of limiting the effects of economic crises and reducing the effects of financial upheavals, especially in developing countries. At any rate, we believe that such crises and shake-ups may happen from time to time and may touch every country, no matter how immune it may seem, so long as the most powerful and prevalent monetary unit in the world — the United States dollar — is not stable. However, the imminent issuance of a European monetary unit may contribute to establishing a more stable international financial and economic system. In any case, we believe there is no alternative to opening a serious dialogue within the framework of the United Nations between developing and developed countries and international monetary institutions in order to lay a solid foundation for international cooperation which might save the world from economic surprises and social upheavals and also contribute positively to the interests of all countries in the world, in the South as well as the North. Since its beginning, the Arab-Israeli conflict has been given high priority on the agenda of the international community. International efforts to contain this conflict have been unrelenting every time it has exploded, because the Middle East, with its singular strategic position, its tremendous material and spiritual wealth and its renowned cultural heritage can be considered the most sensitive parameter for measuring the state of world peace and security. The peace process that was launched in Madrid was seen as a new beginning to settle this conflict with the end of the cold war. The Madrid terms of reference, the American assurances and the results reached constituted a firm basis which cannot be ignored under any circumstance. The insistence of the Israeli Prime Minister on pursuing a policy hostile to peace and his rejection of the rights of the Arabs to regain the occupied territories under the pretext of security for Israel alone — at a time when Israel?s military arsenal is considered one of the mightiest and most modern in the world — constitute a challenge not only to the Arabs, but also to the will of the international community as a whole. It seems clear that Israel does not limit its conception of security to the Arab territories it occupies; rather it is working to establish a military alliance in the region which will undermine the peace process and put the region on a path fraught with dangers, tension and the potential for explosion. 11 What the region and its peoples need is not the establishment of alliances and axes but the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace, based on the full withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Syrian Golan to the line of 4 June 1967 and from the south of Lebanon and its western Bekaa, in implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions and the land-for-peace principle. In addition, the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people must be safeguarded, including their right to self- determination and the establishment of their independent State on their national territory. The peace process faces a real crisis. It has been in a stalemate on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks for over two years. It faces erosion on the Palestinian track, as well, due to Israeli intransigence. The entire peace process is on the wane and will be so long as the Israeli Government rejects the principle of land for peace and attempts to impose on the Arabs a peace based on occupation and settlerism. However, Syria has been and continues to be committed to peace; we consider it a strategic option that requires the resumption of negotiations from the point at which they stopped on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks and that continues to build on the commitments and undertakings reached until a just and comprehensive peace is established in the region. Syria stresses its concern for the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq and calls for alleviating the suffering of our brotherly Iraqi people and lifting the sanctions imposed on them according to a specific timetable. In the meantime, Iraq is called upon to implement the remaining Security Council resolutions in a way that guarantees a just resolution to the issue of Kuwaiti prisoners of war. Syria also calls for an end to the sanctions imposed on Libya, for it is our belief that it is possible to address this crisis in an appropriate legal framework, separate from any political motivation. We fully support the Libyan demand for a solution to this problem on a just basis. Syria stands against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations; we condemn it on all fronts. We differentiate between terrorism and the legitimate struggle of peoples against foreign occupation and for self- determination and national liberation, which cannot be considered terrorism. We also condemn killing innocent civilians everywhere, just as we condemn the State terrorism exercised by Israel against the Arabs. We believe that resorting to force and violence in international relations, in contravention of the United Nations Charter and the principles of international law, does not promote international legitimacy but leaves the door wide open to the law of the jungle. In this regard, Syria finds the United States attack on the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical facility in Sudan to be unjustified. We believe that this attack constitutes a violation of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. From this perspective, Syria supports the request of the Sudanese Government to the Security Council to send a fact-finding mission to investigate the American allegations relating to that installation. Syria follows with great concern the sharp conflicts sweeping some African countries. While expressing its solidarity and support to the peoples of Africa, Syria calls on the international community to make the necessary efforts in close cooperation with the Organization of African Unity to find solutions to these conflicts in a manner that consolidates peace, stability and security on the African continent. The international community is also called upon to give all types of support to enable African States to eliminate the scourge of poverty and free themselves of the burden of debt in order to achieve sustainable development. We are also following with great concern the situation in the Republic of Somalia. We urge all the Somali parties to respect their undertakings and implement the agreements reached among them. We call on them to put the national interests of Somalia above all other considerations and to cooperate with Arab, African and international efforts towards the realization of national reconciliation so as to guarantee the return of security and stability for the Somali people. Syria supports the measures taken to ensure the achievement of peace and security in the Korean peninsula, and we also support the Korean people?s aspirations to achieve unity. Syria stresses anew the urgent need to take all necessary steps, as promptly as possible, to end the economic, commercial and financial sanctions imposed by the United States against Cuba for more than three decades now. We second Cuba?s call for the resolution of differences between the two countries through dialogue, on the basis of equality, mutual respect and good- neighbourly relations. 12 Syria is extremely concerned about the general situation in Afghanistan and the continuing bloodshed. Syria strongly condemns the killing of the Iranian diplomats in Mazar-i-Sharif. This was a violation of the principles of international law and of the tolerant values of Islam. We call upon all parties to exercise self-restraint and to work towards reaching a peaceful solution and national reconciliation. Syria supports the stand of the Non-Aligned Movement which considers the reform of the Security Council, its democratization and the expansion of its membership as part and parcel of a package deal that is not subject to a specific timetable. We emphasize the principles of equal sovereignty among States and equitable geographical representation according to the provisions of the Charter. Syria also believes that the exercise of the right of veto should be reduced and that its scope should be limited. We support the position of the Non-Aligned Movement concerning the concept of general agreement, specifically that such agreement should, in conformity with the provisions of Article 108 of the Charter, require a majority of two thirds of Member States. The Secretary-General?s proposed plan for reform was a positive step to improve the Organization?s efficiency and enable it to cope with the changes required in the next stage. The Syrian delegation participated in the discussions relevant to reforming the United Nations in the spirit of collective responsibility of Member States to enhance the role of this international Organization. We believe that Member States do have a major role to play in consultations concerning the reforms and in the resulting resolutions. The fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is an important occasion for re- emphasizing the fact that all human rights are universal and interrelated and that the international community should address human rights in a just and comprehensive manner, free of double standards and manipulations for political purposes or to interfere in the internal affairs of States, and taking into account the national characteristics and the historical, cultural and religious elements of each people and nation. Humankind continues to aspire to a world free of wars, poverty, ignorance and injustice, a world in which justice, security, stability and sustainable development prevail. Peoples of the world have pinned their hopes on the United Nations Charter, which specifies among its purposes the importance of maintaining world peace and security, developing relations among nations based on respect for equality and self-determination of peoples, achieving international cooperation in the economic, social and cultural fields and enhancing basic freedoms for mankind everywhere. Let us work together seriously and confidently on the basis of these principles and objectives. Let us not disappoint future generations. This is not an easy task, but it is certainly a noble one, which deserves our efforts, sacrifice, patience and wisdom. Mr. President, it is such a pleasure that a distinguished son of our region should preside over these proceedings. We wish you well and pledge our full support. This year we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of a Declaration which was predicated on the assumption that the right to development is a human right. The golden jubilee of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights could not have occurred at a more timely juncture in the history of international affairs. Article 23 of the Declaration insists that everyone has the right to work, the free choice of employment and protection against unemployment. Article 28 boasts that everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration can be fully realized. However, the trends that shape the international order today, the issues that are affecting the destiny of States, are running counter to the spirit of that Declaration, and are, in fact, threatening and hindering that right to development so nobly expressed 50 years ago. As the world enters the dawn of a new millennium, the phenomenon of globalization characterizes the new international order. There is no escaping the reality that globalization is today a fact of life: the integration and interlocking of systems of production, finance and capital and trade, and liberalized markets that have shunned national boundaries and have produced remarkable wealth and economic growth. 22 But there is an almost ominous ring about the word “globalization”. It gobbles up the small plankton of countries which cannot adjust to the frenzy of the market. Globalization has not been all about wealth and prosperity for all the nations of the world. For billions of people in the developing world, it has used them and bypassed them, when in reality, globalization should be about development for all. The 1997 United Nations Development Programme report confirms that only a few fortunate countries had benefited from globalization. Those countries which have shared in the rapidly expanded world trade have seen their own trade become a larger proportion of their gross domestic product. But for 44 developing countries, with more than a billion people, this key ratio had been falling over the previous decade. Yes, the growth in financial flows has been rapid, but its circulation has been predominantly in the capital markets of the developed world, while investment flows have coursed through only a few developing countries. The Asian Tiger economies, which had achieved amazing levels of development and growth in a short space of time, had been held up as models for the new age of global free markets. However, the collapse of these economies in 1997, coming three years after the Mexican case, has reinforced fears that globalization has made the world economy more volatile and more unstable. That even such star performers would be battered so severely suggests that vulnerability has increased significantly with globalization. Foreign money can flee as quickly as it comes in and leave countries in deep trouble. Saint Lucia is one of those countries caught up on the dizzy Ferris wheel of globalization, without the luxury of the choice of being able to jump off or determine how the wheel spins. Trade liberalization, the twin of globalization, has not been kind to us, and the midwife of trade liberalization — the World Trade Organization (WTO) — has dealt us an even more unkind cut. Last year, the head of our Government, Prime Minister Dr. Kenny Anthony, in his address to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session, complained of the impact on Saint Lucia and the Caribbean of a ruling by the WTO with respect to the European banana marketing regime. That ruling, which was instigated by a few complainant countries from the Americas, has the capacity to lead to the social and economic destruction of a number of small States in the Caribbean, like Saint Lucia, for which bananas are a major vital export commodity. That ruling tears at the heart of our development process, as it can take away from us a system which allows us a preferential market for a crop which is the backbone of our economy. Developing countries and many renowned jurists have criticized the process pursued by the WTO in this case, but what was equally worrying is that the panel did not take into account the developmental, social and environmental impact of the implementation of this ruling. The WTO is not only to be a trade policeman, but is supposed to contribute to improving standards of living. Following the ruling by the WTO last year, that the banana marketing regime was incompatible with its regulations, the European Union had been trying to amend the regime. The objective was not only to make it WTO- compatible, but at the same time, to preserve the kind of access it gave us to the European market — an access essential for our economic development. Earlier this year the European Union accepted amendments to the banana regime which we are all convinced make it WTO- compatible. We, the banana-producing countries of the Caribbean, may have wished that some of the provisions now adopted were different, but we are satisfied that the new regime allows us the opportunity to continue to survive in the market place and sustain our development largely through our own efforts. The European Union retained the special safeguards of Lomé to enable us to market our bananas; and with the Lomé Convention now in receipt of a WTO waiver, we thought that we had been given the breathing space we needed for orderly reform and diversification and for adjustment to the new realities of globalization. But, despite this, the United States and a group of Central American countries are continuing an onslaught against our banana industry. One year after our Prime Minister appealed to this body for good sense and sensitivity to prevail in the settling of world trade disputes, in the consideration by international institutions of the plight of the disadvantaged, and in the conduct of strong and powerful countries towards smaller and poorer ones, we return to tell the Assembly that those who should have heeded this appeal seem to have chosen not to hear it. The pursuit of this banana policy by the United States and the Central American countries will expose the economies of the Caribbean to severe and possibly irreparable damage. This is a violation of our right to 23 development — a right that the United Nations recognized as an inalienable human right when it adopted the Declaration on the Right to Development at the 97th plenary meeting of the forty-first session of the General Assembly on 4 December 1986. One year ago, our Prime Minister, before this Assembly, called upon the United States of America to re-examine its policies towards the Caribbean, particularly its lead role in the challenge to the banana marketing regime. We are now engaged in a dialogue with the United States hoping to avert a reconvening of the World Trade Organization dispute panel. Once again we urge the United States and the other complainant countries to apply the spirit of cooperation and consultation to this situation so that we can find a mutually acceptable solution to what they perceive to be the problems. Globalization must not be used by powerful States as an excuse to condemn us to a permanent state of underdevelopment and poverty. Already the rich nations of the world appear to be using globalization as an excuse for their withdrawal from active engagement in the battle against poverty. The scourge of poverty is not new, neither has it ever been acceptable. What is unacceptable is that given all the strides we have made this century in science and technology, in the creation of vast oceans of wealth, we at the same time have failed to reduce the levels of poverty around the world. Many people have enjoyed the benefits of supersonic aircraft, 200-mile-per-hour trains, satellite telephones, global television, the Internet and 24-hour markets. Yet, in the same world and at the same time, there are millions who have never ridden in a motor vehicle, used a telephone, switched on an electric light or had pipe-borne water; millions wholly unfamiliar with such everyday amenities as refrigerators and television sets; millions who cannot read or write; millions of children who do not go to school; millions of infants who do not get enough food to survive. A more vigorous effort to eliminate extreme deprivation should surely be a high priority for the new millennium. Saint Lucia believes this should be achieved by the end of the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty — by the year 2006. Economic progress in recent decades has lifted large numbers out of acute poverty, and success on this front has been particularly notable in the populous country of China. But there is no evidence yet that globally there has been a decline in the number of those classified as “absolute poor”: people whose incomes never rise above the dollar- a-day threshold. These are reckoned to amount to 1.3 billion people, or one in every three persons in the developing world. Nearly three fourths of these people live in Asia, but the highest proportion of very poor people is in Africa. The 1997 report of the United Nations Development Programme states that the total figure appears to be rising with population growth, except in South-East Asia and the Pacific. But this was written before the economic typhoon that battered such South- East Asian countries as Indonesia in 1998, impoverishing many millions of people in that region, and before the serious floods in China had dispossessed so many people. Yet most countries have failed to lift their aid towards the level of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product — the internationally agreed target set several decades ago. In fact, aid from the G-7 countries fell in 1997 to just 0.19 per cent of their collective gross national product. The necessity for the rich countries to understand that the new international order of globalization does not consider the special circumstances of small States is emphasized by the vulnerability of these small States to other elements, such as natural disasters. The extreme vulnerability of small island States, like Saint Lucia, was graphically illustrated only last week in the Caribbean. In just a few hours Hurricane Georges created havoc and destruction in the northern islands of the Caribbean — Saint Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and others. In any one island, at least two decades of economic development were blown away by two hours of storm. That is the extent of the economic vulnerability of these islands. As they struggle to rebuild their economies, as their people try to reorganize their lives again, we appeal to the Member States of the United Nations to be generous in coming forward with assistance for their redevelopment efforts. In a world of an international order that is uncompromising for small States, of inadequate attention to the plight of the poor and to the harsh destructive forces of Mother Nature, it is the United Nations that must become a beacon and a haven for the small and the powerless, for the hungry and the disadvantaged. It is in the United Nations that they must find hope and comfort, answers and solutions to their problems. For this, however, there must be a United Nations that is as sensitive to the danger inherent in small-State 24 vulnerability as it is to the horrors of nuclear warfare, biological and chemical weapons and international terrorism. International terrorism can take many forms. To destroy a country’s economic base and thrust its people into the slow death of unemployment, poverty and despair is as horrendous as the instant killing of its citizens by a bomb blast. While we support the call for a strong abhorrence of international terrorism, we must deplore equally abhorrent acts of unilateral counter-terrorism. Such actions violate the culture of peace and consensus which the United Nations strives to inculcate. There must be a United Nations with a greater commitment to upholding and fulfilling the tenets of article 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Declaration on the Right to Development. There must therefore be further reform of the United Nations to make it more democratic and more appreciative of the voices of the majority, rather than the power of the minority. Saint Lucia therefore supports the call by the Secretary-General for continued urgent reform of the United Nations, provided that it leads to a fairer, more caring and more equitable institution. Saint Lucia also strongly supports the statement delivered by Indonesia on behalf of the G-77 at the high- level dialogue on globalization held here recently and the growing consensus that there is urgent need for global governance of financial and trade matters. Indeed, because of its universal membership and success in promoting international cooperation for development, the United Nations is the best vehicle to foster agreement on standards, norms and regulations for the new financial order of the twenty-first century. The building of a new international financial architecture for the twenty-first century cannot be done piecemeal or by a few exclusive States. It requires global participation, coordinated by the United Nations. Saint Lucia therefore calls for a global conference to address this issue similar to that held on matters pertaining to the environment, population and housing. But reform must not be confined only to the United Nations. In a world of trade liberalization which is not friendly to small States, the guardian of the free market process must itself be reformed. Saint Lucia therefore reiterates its call, first made to the fifty-second session of the General Assembly last year, for reform of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and in particular its dispute- settlement procedures. A revisiting of the WTO began in Singapore, where developing countries had to assert the limits of WTO interventionism. What is additionally required of the WTO now was outlined by Prime Minister Mr. Kenny Anthony when, in his capacity as Chairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), he addressed the recent meeting of heads of State of the Non-Aligned Movement in Durban, South Africa. He said: “More generally, the WTO must now take urgent steps to implement the agreement at Singapore, for a special regime for the least developed countries and those who share the characteristics of fragility. It is time that values like fairness and equity asserted their legitimacy in the ethically neutral world of globalization and liberalization.” Saint Lucia firmly believes that despite the actions of developed countries, we in the developing world can ourselves assert and protect our right to development if we engage in greater cooperation among ourselves. We in the Caribbean have for years been engaged in an integration movement which has strengthened our capacity to deal with the challenges of international relations. Indeed, this year Saint Lucia was proud to be the host nation for the celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Treaty of Chaguaramas, which created the Caribbean Community. As we embark on the next quarter of a century, Saint Lucia pledges to work for even greater union in the Caribbean Community and closer association between all the countries of the Caribbean Sea. It is for this reason that Saint Lucia welcomes the recent initiatives that have brought Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Haiti into a closer relationship with CARICOM as we seek to forge a new partnership with the European Union. In this connection, Saint Lucia calls for the understanding that Cuba is a Caribbean country and that closer relations with other Caribbean countries is a natural evolution which must not be perceived as being hostile to the interests of extraregional Powers. We call too for the lifting of the economic embargo against Cuba and for its reintegration into the inter-American system. It is only through dialogue and consultation, not through conflict and hostility, that problems are permanently solved. Saint Lucia also welcomes the recent meeting in Durban between the Caribbean Community and the Southern African Development Community, which laid the basis for the future strengthening of relations between 25 the two regions. We applaud also the decision by the heads of State of the Non-Aligned Movement to hold a South- South summit and their decision to convene a standing ministerial committee for economic cooperation in 1999, to address the challenges and opportunities of globalization. Our efforts to realize our right to development can enjoy fulfilment only if they take place in an atmosphere of world peace and harmony. We cannot prevent nuclear genies from popping out of bottles unless we destroy all the bottles with a treaty designed to eliminate all nuclear armaments. The existence of exclusive nuclear clubs is an open invitation to nations which are excluded. We in the Caribbean continue to call for the Caribbean to be recognized as a zone of peace. We also call for respect and support of the initiative of CARICOM for the Caribbean Sea to be declared a special area in the context of sustainable development. Saint Lucia, therefore, like other Caribbean States, continues to register its opposition to the use of the Caribbean Sea for the trans-shipment of nuclear waste by some great Powers. While some of those Powers can sustain a nuclear accident, given their size and population, a small island of a few hundred thousand people certainly cannot. The best guarantee we can obtain against a nuclear accident in the Caribbean Sea as a result of the trans-shipment of nuclear waste is not the assurances of the countries engaged in the practice, but a halt to the practice itself. As we call for international recognition of our right to determine what kind of place we wish our region to be, and as we assert our inalienable human right to development and call upon others to respect that right by withdrawing their challenge to the lifeblood of our economy, we urge the rich nations to recognize the insensitivity of globalization, and we ask the international community to take as an example that great international leader, President Nelson Mandela. As we seek to establish a new, more humane international order for the coming millennium, an order that will truly reflect the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, let us remember the moral leadership that he has given us. Nelson Mandela taught us that holding steadfast to principle and insisting on justice can produce change even in the most intransigent of systems. The world has become a global neighbourhood, and we must insist on living by brotherly principles and values. The focus for moral leadership might have shifted to the developing world, with Nelson Mandela and Fidel Castro as the twin peaks of international inspiration. It is their lifelong struggle for human rights that must become the touchstone for our developmental goals in this anniversary year.Please accept our sincere congratulations, Sir, on the occasion of your election to preside over the fifty-third session, as well as our wishes for success in realizing the goals and principles of the United Nations. We welcome all the efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the benefit of the Organization and its Member States, and sincerely wish him further success on his way, which is strewn not with roses alone. With appropriate respect and great appreciation for the activities of the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, we wish him important achievements in his activities as a Member of Parliament in his native country. Today, on the very threshold of the third millennium, it becomes clear for the majority of Member States that the time has come to take comprehensive measures for everyone to turn the determination of the peoples of the United Nations, declared in its Charter, into reality “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war ... to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours”. In fact, that was the ultimate goal behind all the diverse activities of the United Nations in the years after its Charter came into force in 1945. The world goes through non-stop change. Today the global environment in which Member States cooperate to achieve the goals of the Charter is different from that of half a century ago. United Nations activities should reflect more adequately those sweeping changes of the second half of the twentieth century, many of which shattered the world. The Government of the Republic of Belarus has been persistent and consistent in its efforts to promote peace, friendship, good-neighbourly relations and mutually beneficial cooperation. This policy is enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus, chapter 18 of which, in particular, declares: “In its foreign policy the Republic of Belarus proceeds from the principles of the equality of States, non-use of force or the threat to use force, inviolability of frontiers, peaceful settlement of disputes, non-interference in internal affairs of States and other universally acknowledged principles and standards of international law. “The Republic of Belarus pledges itself to make its territory a neutral, nuclear-weapon-free State.” 30 Thus the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus is consistent with all our obligations under the United Nations Charter and other instruments of international law to which Belarus is a party. The United Nations is to define far-reaching goals and guidelines for international cooperation into the twenty-first century. Everybody wants to be better off, to have the opportunity to work and live in peace and freedom. There is a need for the United Nations to elaborate an effective legislative, economic, social and political framework to give humankind an opportunity to realize these legitimate aspirations in an environment much more favourable than the one we have had in the century that draws to its close. Most global problems are persistent, hard to resolve and resist old approaches. We should seek new solutions and reach agreements to do away with the problems in unconventional, innovative ways. I believe that the proposed reform of the United Nations will give us a good opportunity to achieve this. Our attitude to the reform was defined in the letter of the President of the Republic of Belarus, His Excellency Mr. Alyaksandr Lukashenka, to the Secretary-General. We must ensure that reforming the activities of the United Nations does not disrupt the attainment of its goals and the implementation of its principles or derogate the interests of Member States and regional groups. Reforms should not mean disorganization. Reforms should mean the synergy of the best United Nations achievements in all areas of its activities, which have been developed for more than half a century. We believe in the ability of the Secretary-General and his staff to lead our Organization exactly in the required direction. On its part, the Republic of Belarus will do its utmost to contribute in all ways possible to the enhancement of the efficiency of the United Nations and its specialized agencies, and will seek generally acceptable agreements on all the issues of the global agenda. Strengthening the United Nations system and reforming the Security Council on the basis of just and balanced representation of the regional groups would be most instrumental in this respect. Together with other East European States, in particular members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Belarus has been an active initial proponent of the demand to allocate an additional non-permanent seat to that group in the expanded Security Council. People all over the world and the international community as a whole can no longer tolerate the killing of human beings in inter-State and intra-State armed conflicts. During the years after the Second World War thousands upon thousands, if not millions of people, have been killed. Nevertheless, hostilities continue in different regions of the globe. Conflicts in Africa, the Middle East and the Balkans stay unresolved; still unsettled are situations in Cyprus and other regions. In these tremendously difficult circumstances the United Nations is continuing to fulfil its responsibility with dignity. Yet there is ample room for further improvement. We consider that the principles of the peaceful settlement of disputes and non-interference in internal affairs should be strictly observed while bringing about reconciliation in regional and domestic conflicts. Any enforcement measures should only be applied following the adoption of a Security Council resolution. Accordingly, the use of force by individual States or regional organizations at their own discretion should not be permissible. One of the objectives stipulated in the United Nations Charter, in the preamble, is “to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest”. It is difficult for the Government and people of the Republic of Belarus to comprehend why in certain quarters the idea of a military attack on the sovereign State of Yugoslavia is being publicly discussed just because the latter decided to solve its domestic problems, though really complicated, in its own way and would not rubber-stamp recipes enforced from outside. It is also time that Yugoslavia?s full membership of the United Nations be resumed. The mere threat of the use of force could seriously disrupt peace and stability in Europe, revive old fears and animosities and generate more distrust. The very serious problems that humanity faces today can be solved by reason and joint actions, rather than by force. Paradoxically, despite the ever growing industrial and economic output in the world, the number of people living below the poverty line is not diminishing. More and more people are becoming refugees or displaced persons. Humanism, justice, fairness and respect for human rights have not become universal. Terrorism, organized crime and illegal drug trafficking have not been overcome, and even tend to grow. We share the Secretary-General?s view that the forces of globalization “pose extraordinary opportunities, as well as enormous challenges”. (A/53/1, para. 229) The recent financial crisis in many parts of the world is one of the latest and clearest manifestations of that. 31 Ecological interdependence has not yet become a matter of common awareness, as evidenced, in particular, by the attitude to efforts to mitigate the after-effects of the Chernobyl disaster. Belarus, which absorbed 70 per cent of all the radioactive Chernobyl fallout, spends one fifth of its budget annually to eliminate the consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe. We are grateful for all international assistance, particularly in the rehabilitation of children. At the same time, the United Nations has prepared the inter- agency programme of international assistance to areas affected by the Chernobyl disaster, in order to revive international interaction for Chernobyl programmes and make it more purposeful and effective. Furthermore, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has organized two international special donor meetings to raise funds for the implementation of this programme, estimated at $74 million. Yet the results of those meetings appear modest so far and demonstrate a disappointing deficit of international solidarity with the affected countries in solving their problems. Given the global dimensions and implications of the disaster, I would like to take this opportunity to again call on the donor countries, international organizations and non- governmental organizations to consider every possibility of their participation in financing the implementation of the programme. It is common knowledge that Belarus took an unprecedented step in post-world-war history by voluntarily and unconditionally renouncing the nuclear arsenal in its possession. Ukraine and Kazakhstan undertook similar measures, but at a later stage. These initiatives received unanimous high international appreciation, as confirmed by relevant United Nations resolutions, and were also endorsed by North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member States, which explicitly welcomed the step. The latter specifically voiced, through NATO?s Secretary-General, its support of the goal shared by Belarus to “establish a common security system that would meet the interests of all States”. At first, it seemed that there was a will to legally consolidate a newly emerging international security system and to promote disarmament, non-proliferation and the non- use of nuclear weapons. Those aspirations, however, have yet to be realized. According to the United Nations Disarmament Commission, nuclear-weapon-free zones at present cover more than half of the Earth?s surface, with an aggregate membership of 144 countries. Yet there is still resistance to the creation of new nuclear-weapon-free zones, in the southern hemisphere as well as the northern hemisphere. Therefore, the Belarus initiative of retaining a nuclear- weapon-free status quo in Central and Eastern Europe is also stalled. The emergence of new nuclear-capable countries also affected the situation with regard to the existing nuclear-weapon-free zones, whose members have yet to win the acknowledgement of their nuclear-weapon- free status by the nuclear States. Moreover, there are no guarantees that other “threshold” States will not express in the future their intention to join the “nuclear club”. We urge those Member States which have not yet done so to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). We would also welcome progress in the respective activities of the Conference on Disarmament and the United Nations Disarmament Commission. In view of the above, a more constructive approach to the issue of disarmament and arms limitation, inter alia, in the nuclear field, is called for. The reduction of nuclear stockpiles currently under way in the United States and Russia is to be complemented by similar efforts by other holders of nuclear weapons, so as to jointly facilitate the complete disbanding of nuclear and other means of mass destruction. It is the ultimate objective. To attain it, a number of specific prerequisites must be created. I would like to refer in particular to the statement of the NATO ministerial meeting on 10 December 1996, confirmed by the NATO heads of State or Government in the Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Russian Federation of 27 May 1997, which maintains that “the NATO States have no intention, plan or reason to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of the new members.” We believe that that statement by NATO deserves approval by a General Assembly resolution. I should also mention the 1996 Stockholm Declaration of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Parliamentary Assembly, which contains a reference to the decision of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference that “the establishment of additional nuclear-weapon-free zones by the time of the Review Conference in the year 2000 would be welcome.” (NPT/Conf.1995/32, Part I, Decision 2, para. 6) With due regard to that, we cannot accept the argument that it is premature to discuss and implement the initiative to create a nuclear-weapon-free space in 32 Central and Eastern Europe at this juncture, and that it might only be addressed in the distant future. Inspired by new partnerships, we cannot possibly let the existing de facto nuclear-weapon-free status of Central and Eastern Europe evaporate. We are convinced that the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free space in Europe would constructively contribute to the shaping of a new European security architecture aspired to by all the OSCE Member States. The fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is widely celebrated this year throughout the world. The provisions of the Declaration and other international instruments on human rights, to which Belarus is a dutiful party, are reflected in the Constitution and other legislation of my country and are strictly implemented at the State level, proceeding from the indivisibility and interdependency of civil rights and obligations. Much has been done in Belarus to highlight the United Nations efforts to promote and protect human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was reprinted and widely circulated. The National Assembly held parliamentary hearings devoted to human rights. It should be noted here that the hearings were broadcast live on Belorussian radio in their entirety. Other undertakings are envisaged, including preparations to introduce the institution of Ombudsman in Belarus. All these efforts are aimed, to cite the United Nations Charter, at promoting “social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom”. The representatives of Belarus will give a detailed account of these matters during the discussion of relevant issues on the agenda. At the same time, we share the position of other Member States that there is an ever pressing need to observe the United Nations Charter and declarations based thereon concerning non-interference in the internal affairs of States and the protection of their independence and sovereignty. The same is true of the principles of international law referring to friendly relations and cooperation between States. I would like to pay special tribute to the positive experience Belarus has gained in cooperating with United Nations bodies. We greatly appreciate the role and importance of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in our country regarding human resources development, strengthening the potential of State management, restructuring industries and creating civil society. We hope for a broadening of the United Nations programme activities related to solving the problems faced by the Republic of Belarus and other countries with economies in transition. Our people live in a non-violent environment and work very hard to overcome current economic difficulties and achieve substantial output in the State-owned and private sectors. In that context, in 1997 gross domestic product increased by 10 per cent and industrial output by 17 per cent, and the production of consumer goods also rose. This all came about as a result of the efforts made by the Belorussian people, as well as through the promotion of subregional integration and cooperation with other countries. Belarus, like other CIS States, is painstakingly striving to overcome the tremendous difficulties that emerged in the country after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Now that we are in a period of transition, my country would be justified in expecting encouragement, solidarity and support from the international community. We would appreciate such support from all countries and from every people of the world. The Republic of Belarus is committed to the conscientious fulfilment of all its international obligations under the United Nations Charter in their integrity, and we wish success to the family of nations in this work. It is a pleasure for me to convey to you, Sir, the satisfaction of the delegation of Congo at seeing you conducting our work. Your unanimous election to the presidency of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly not only denotes recognition by the international community of your great qualities as a statesman and experienced diplomat, but also attests to the important role played by your country, Uruguay, in the maintenance of peace in the world. 12 Mr. President, I wish to convey to you and to the other members of the Bureau our heartfelt, sincere congratulations and to assure you of the full cooperation of the delegation of Congo. I should like also to pay well- deserved tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for the competence and open-mindedness with which he conducted the work of the previous session. Finally, I wish to express the appreciation of our delegation to the Secretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Kofi Annan, who, in a world where violence, injustice and frustration predominate, has been tirelessly striving to assert the virtues of dialogue and tolerance and to promote peace and development. Peace and development: these two ideals have for decades posed a major challenge to the international community. It is very difficult to take the floor after all of the outstanding and talented speakers who have spoken from this rostrum. What more could I add to all of the points so eloquently made about Africa and the rest of the world? For more than a decade now, Africa has made the headlines only as the result of crises and conflicts: civil wars, inter-State wars, drought, famine and epidemics. All of these obstacles so impede the development of our continent that we cannot but wonder whether Africa will be entering the third millennium on the wrong foot. Unfortunately, Congo, my country, is an example of this. A year ago, Congo had been in the throes of a civil war for five long months. The international community and our Organization in particular strove hard to find a negotiated solution to the conflict. We wish to pay tribute to the commendable efforts made by the Secretary-General jointly with a numerous African heads of State. Unfortunately, we all know that these efforts were unsuccessful. We are convinced that respect for the state of law and good governance remain, in a sound economic environment, a prerequisite for the well-being of our peoples. And it is because they did not understand this point that the former ruling class imposed on the peaceful citizens of my country two civil wars in the space of five years, the latest of which — that of 1997 — was the most deadly and the most devastating. We do not intend to dwell on the many ways the former regime violated the rules of democracy, even if this would be helpful in understanding the causes of the tragic events that my country has experienced. Today the war is over. Congo is resolutely looking to the future. The future means national reconciliation; it means rebuilding our devastated country; it means resuming the democratic process. From 5 to 14 January last, a national forum was held at Brazzaville to study practical modalities to attain these goals. That forum, which brought together more than 1,400 participants representing all segments of Congolese society, established a transitional Parliament and set the duration for this transitional period at three years. The Government of National Unity and Public Salvation is now concentrating on the following priorities: the reconciliation of all the sons and daughters of the country; the rehabilitation of our infrastructure; the restoration of State administration; the resumption of the democratic process — census-taking started again last August; the reorganization of our national economy with, inter alia, the privatization of the major State companies; and the resumption of negotiations with international financial institutions, which concluded in June this year with the adoption of a post-conflict programme. Today, in the light of the results obtained, we can state that the transitional timetable will be respected. These encouraging results have yet to be consolidated, and our country is still fragile because of the turmoil in the subregion. The events taking place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo cause great concern to my country, since our stability largely depends on that of our neighbours. I therefore want to reaffirm the Congolese Government?s commitment to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Our country will never serve as a base of operations for the destabilization of this fraternal country. Understanding the costs of civil war and anxious to contribute to finding a political solution to this crisis, Congo (Brazzaville) has been working with its various contacts among all the States of the subregion. This was the case in Durban during the summit of the Non-Aligned Countries, when President Denis Sassou Nguesso met most of his counterparts, and more recently in Libreville, at the summit of Central African heads of State. Our country intends to honour its commitments under the relevant provisions of Conventions of the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations 13 relating to refugees and displaced persons. Therefore, I must solemnly repudiate the false allegations by certain media of a supposed agreement between the Governments of the two Congos to transfer displaced Rwandans located in Congo (Brazzaville) to Congo (Kinshasa) so that they can participate in the war. The displaced Rwandans living in Congo (Brazzaville) are in fact under the control of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and any movement of them is taking place without the support of our Government, which wishes to inform the international community that it refuses to accept any responsibility for the consequences. In Angola the hopes aroused by the Lusaka Protocol have been continually dashed by the bad faith and sudden reversals of position of Mr. Jonas Savimbi, who is thereby taking a whole segment of the Angolan people hostage, denying them the opportunity to pursue development tasks. My country firmly supports the Angolan Government in its efforts to achieve lasting peace in the country and to finalize rapidly and completely the implementation of the Lusaka Accords. My country completely supports the decision adopted by the Southern African Development Community heads of State or Government in Mauritius, describing Mr. Jonas Savimbi as the person solely responsible for the deterioration of the situation in Angola and calling upon other States to refrain from providing any support for Mr. Jonas Savimbi and his militarist wing. I would like to take this occasion to pay tribute to the memory of Alioune Blondin Beye, a worthy son of Africa, who gave the best of himself, including making the supreme sacrifice, in the search for peace in Angola. As regards other hot spots, the Congo always advocates negotiated solutions. Therefore, we welcome the ceasefire in Guinea-Bissau, and we hope that it will be used to work out a final solution to that conflict. The same goes for the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea; in this regard, we support the efforts of the Organization of African Unity mediation committee. We cannot overlook the crises and tensions prevailing in other parts of the world, notably in the Middle East, where the peace process relaunched by the Oslo Accords is now stalled, but also in South Asia, where the recent nuclear tests conducted by India and then Pakistan have heightened the already high level of tension. The establishment of just and lasting peace in the world requires full recognition of the destabilizing factors as well as of the real solutions to development problems. One only needs recall the extent to which peace and development are linked. In the light of the changes in the world, and after more than half a century of existence, the United Nations seems to be gradually and dangerously moving away from the vision of its founding fathers. Solidarity seems to be giving way to a selfishness that has no time for solidarity. This new trend is making increasingly difficult the management of economic questions, which have already been the subject of much thought, without producing any prospect of an improvement in the living standards of the peoples of most of our States. Violence, famine, disease and poverty continue to afflict our peoples. The underlying causes of these scourges are constantly the subject of a multitude of studies and various economic stimulation and development programmes, but without result, because of a lack of real commitment by the international community. The Agenda for Development, the international strategy for the development of Africa, the Secretary-General?s System-wide Special Initiative on Africa — to cite merely those examples — are just so many plans that no longer give reason for optimism. Today globalization is supposed to be the panacea. This at least is the philosophy of worldwide liberalization. But how can we be confident when the export opportunities for the developing countries are often neutralized by protectionism in a new guise, which uses various pretexts — technical standards, environmental and social concerns, or even concerns about human rights? How can we be confident when official development assistance continues to decline? How can we be sure when the weakest economies are bending beneath the burden of debt? With regard to Africa, we believe that through economic integration we can mitigate the undesirable effects of globalization. Through greater solidarity we can hope to meet the challenges we face. This year the international community is commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is very significant that this anniversary coincides with the establishment of the International Criminal Court, which our Government considers to be a major step forward. We believe that this event puts the finishing touch to the magnificent edifice 14 that the founding fathers began constructing more than 50 years ago. But today?s United Nations is not the same as the old one. Where once there were only a few dozen Member States, today there are 185. The problems of peace and development are not what they were in 1945. It is time to review the management of our communal house. It is time to reform the Organization, including the Security Council. It is time to democratize the Organization in order to better adapt it to the requirements of the coming millennium. I cannot conclude without expressing the compassion of the Congolese Government and those affected by the calamity now afflicting the Caribbean and the southern United States as a result of hurricane Georges. This wanton unleashing of the forces of nature reminds us that we are all, large and small, in the same boat — our planet Earth — and that we must show solidarity to one another.   This year we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In our global community, the issue of human rights is the concern of us all. For this reason the Government of Norway welcomes the fact that human rights are now being given increased priority in the work of the United Nations. Adoption by the General Assembly of a declaration on human rights defenders on the International Human Rights Day, on 10 December, would represent proof of our strong commitment in this field. Human rights is basically about human dignity â€” about protecting the individual against oppression and exploitation, poverty and injustice, marginalization and degradation. The struggle for civil and political rights and for social, economic and cultural rights must be one and the same struggle. When we address breaches of civil and political rights, we must also address the issues of development and poverty. As a new millennium is upon us, one of our most fundamental challenges is the realization of a humane world. This must be more than a vision. It is a moral imperative. All Governments endeavouring to implement and promote respect for human rights in their societies deserve our wholehearted support. Democracy, transparency and good governance are essential for economic growth, sustainable development and political stability. Governments that continue to disregard basic 30 human rights norms deprive their populations not only of political freedom, but also of improved economic conditions. The pursuit of a humane world requires new approaches. And new tools. A good example of this approach is the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti- personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, which was negotiated in Oslo. With the ratification by Burkina Faso, presently chairing the Organization of African Unity (OAU), as the fortieth country, the Ottawa process has in less than two years produced a binding international legal instrument which will enter into force early next year. This has been made possible by a new diplomacy reaching beyond relations between States to engage individuals and non-governmental organizations. Our efforts to rid the world of the scourge of anti- personnel mines must be intensified so that we can reach the objectives set out in the Ottawa process. Norway has already made a commitment of $120 million over a five- year period to mine action programmes, including assistance to mine victims. We call on other Governments to join in this endeavour. The United Nations has a central role to play in these efforts. The partnership between Governments, international organizations and civil society demonstrated throughout the Ottawa process should be pursued in our new drive to restrict proliferation of small arms and light weapons. In recent years it has become evident that small arms are a formidable barrier to ending violent conflicts and consolidating peace, political stability and reconstruction of war-torn societies. We need to intensify and harmonize our efforts to combat the illegal trade in and proliferation of such arms, which account for most casualties in todayâs conflicts. Norway has committed considerable resources to immediate action to assist populations in war-torn societies. We support demobilization and arms collection programmes in a number of countries, and we have raised the question of what role United Nations peacekeeping operations could play in these areas. To further strengthen these efforts, Norway proposes the establishment of a trust fund to combat the widespread proliferation and illegal use of small arms, in particular through the collection and destruction of such weapons at the end of armed conflicts. Norway will pledge 15 million Norwegian kroner (NKr) â€” about $2 million â€” to the establishment of such a trust fund and calls on other countries to follow suit. We propose that the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) be charged with the management of the fund. Norway is gravely concerned by the recent underground nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. I would like to emphasize the crucial importance of both the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) for international efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and achieve nuclear disarmament. Therefore, Norway urges all countries to join the NPT and the CTBT. We believe the United Nations should serve as an important forum for strengthened dialogue and exchange of information on non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament and that it should contribute to more transparency and confidence in these crucial matters. The current world economic crisis clearly illustrates that we are all part of a single global economy. It also illustrates that we are far from fully understanding the powerful forces of globalization, and even further from being able to adequately manage them. The international financial crisis has led to soaring unemployment, plummeting living standards and shattered expectations of a better life for millions of people. We clearly need a better understanding and better management of the global economy. My Government shares the serious concern expressed by the recent summit meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in Durban. While the process of globalization has led to greater economic opportunities for many, a large number of developing countries are being left even further behind in the wake of the increasing integration of the world economy. As was pointed out during last weekâs high-level meeting on globalization and development here at the United Nations, there is no alternative to multilateral cooperation efforts if we are to maximize the positive effects of globalization, while minimizing its negative aspects. While our planet is shrinking, the income gap continues to grow â€” between as well as within nations. At the same time, we are experiencing a steep reduction in official development aid from North to South. It is a regrettable fact that the industrialized countries are increasingly distancing themselves from the agreed United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for development purposes. 31 Developed and developing countries alike are accusing each other of broken promises and failure to live up to their commitments. What we need is a new partnership based on result-oriented policies in developing countries and a commitment on the part of the developed countries to reach the 0.7 per cent target within an agreed time-frame. Norway, which has been well above this target for decades, is actively seeking to counter the growing donor fatigue and intends to further increase its official development assistance in the years ahead. Many of our most pressing problems are international in nature and global in scope. International crime and terrorism, environmental degradation and the spread of disease do not need passports to cross borders. They are global problems, requiring global solutions. As the world changes, so must the United Nations. We have previously commended the Secretary-General for his reform agenda. Much has already been done. It is now up to us, the Member States, to promote the reform process throughout the whole United Nations system. We cannot ask the United Nations to do more and perform better, while at the same time cutting back on its resources. As a very minimum, all Member States must honour their legal commitments and pay their dues in full, on time and without conditions. For the poorest and most heavily indebted developing countries, the debt problem represents one of the main obstacles to development. Urgent action is needed to end the unsustainable debt burden of these countries. Norway for its part will launch a comprehensive national debt relief strategy. The strategy will form the basis for our policy for supporting and strengthening the international debt relief schemes. It will also contain additional debt reduction measures on a bilateral basis which will be applied on top of the reductions made under multilateral operations. No investments yield a higher return than investments in basic social services â€” in primary health and education. Since the World Social Summit, Norway has actively advocated the 20/20 principle. This calls for a mutual commitment between developed and developing countries to allocate 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets, respectively, to basic social programmes. We encourage all countries to adhere to this target. Economic growth and social development underpin political stability. But political stability and good governance are also prerequisites for sustained economic development. While the United Nations should retain its vital role in economic, environmental and social affairs, the Organization must also involve itself more extensively in conflict prevention, crisis management and peace- building efforts. In two weeksâ time we will be commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of United Nations peacekeeping operations. The United Nations has proved indispensable for maintaining stability, peace and security for millions of people, for which it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize 10 years ago. At this juncture, we pledge our continued support for the United Nations peacekeeping endeavours. The Organizationâs capacity must be further enhanced, not least with regard to rapid response to armed conflicts. In particular, we wish to honour those who have given their lives under the United Nations flag. The increasing number of casualties among United Nations personnel on missions abroad has made us more aware of the security situation for United Nations staff. Today, the Geneva Conventions go a long way in protecting uniformed personnel in combat situations. United Nations personnel working to promote and alleviate the suffering created by war are not protected in the same way under international law. It is therefore important to improve the security situation of United Nations staff, and we urge more countries to sign and ratify the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel. To further facilitate the United Nations role in preventing conflicts, Norway took the initiative two years ago to establish a Trust Fund for Preventive Action. This fund has made it possible for the United Nations to undertake preventive missions and diplomatic initiatives it otherwise would not have the resources to carry out. Some countries have made contributions to the fund. We encourage others to do the same. To enable the Security Council to better fulfil its prime task of preventing conflict and securing international peace, it is important to enhance its legitimacy while not compromising its efficiency. We need to find broad-based solutions which better reflect the political realities of today. Conflict prevention, crisis management and peace building clearly require a coordinated approach. We must secure a better unity of purpose and integrate United Nations peace-building efforts with those of other stakeholders. Norway will be taking over the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and 32 Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 1999, and we are determined to further refine the already well established working relationship between the United Nations and the OSCE. Most armed conflicts of today are taking place within States. Civilians are increasingly affected, and indeed singled out as military targets. In this context, the adoption in Rome a few months ago of the statute establishing an International Criminal Court is truly a historic achievement. The existence of a permanent, global institution of this kind will allow us to address the serious problem of impunity and will significantly enhance deterrence of the most heinous international crimes. The statute also provides for credible protection against biased, arbitrary and otherwise unwarranted prosecutions. We need more, not less, involvement of the United Nations and regional organizations to prevent underlying conflicts from bursting into flames. In Kosovo, we have in the last few months witnessed an alarming deterioration, where the parties seem determined to resolve the conflict by military means. There is an urgent need for a ceasefire, access for international humanitarian organizations to all parts of Kosovo and stronger involvement by the international community, in order to facilitate a negotiated political solution. Five years ago the Oslo Accord was signed in Washington, and gave hope for a peaceful future for the people of the Middle East. Although progress has been made, the peace process is today in serious difficulties. There is, however, no alternative to a negotiated settlement. The responsibility for advancing the peace process lies first and foremost with the parties themselves. We therefore urge the parties to do their utmost to build confidence and cooperation and to refrain from all unilateral measures and actions designed to pre-empt the outcome of the final status negotiations. Although developments in Latin America in general have been positive over the past few years, there are still situations that give cause for concern. Every support should be given to the new Government in Colombia in its efforts to end the armed conflict. The international community should also give continued support to the implementation of the peace accords in Guatemala. Consolidating the peace is as important as ending the war. Norway commends the Secretary-General for his report on security and development in Africa. Recent developments are indeed worrying and may threaten the stability and future prospects of large parts of the continent. The African nations themselves have the prime responsibility for ensuring a political climate that is conducive to stability and economic growth. However, the international community must provide political support and assist in mediation, peacekeeping, humanitarian aid, human rights enhancement, demobilization efforts and institution-building. It is vital that these activities be coordinated and mutually supportive. Here the United Nations must play a leading role, in close cooperation with the Organization of African Unity and the subregional organizations. We follow with great interest the ongoing work by the Security Council in this respect, and we look forward to the discussions on the General Assemblyâs follow-up of the Secretary-Generalâs report during this session. If we are to meet effectively the many global problems facing us, there is no alternative to concerted multilateral action. We must build a future based on international law, where solidarity and social responsibility are not confined within national boundaries, but stretch across borders and continents. We, as Governments, must do this in close cooperation with civil society, with non-governmental organizations. In all this, the United Nations must be at the very centre of our multilateral efforts.    When I assumed the presidency of my country less than two months ago, I recalled that in the tradition of the Aymara, an indigenous people of the Republic of Bolivia, a human being and a country — and, may I say, the United Nations — do their work if they manage to find harmony in seven fundamental fields. For the Aymaras there is a type of harmony that rises from the head, and that is the harmony we need to maintain with our beliefs and principles. There is a second type of harmony which goes from the feet down. That is the harmony we must maintain with nature, the Earth and the environment. There is a third harmony that goes from the body out to the right side. That is the harmony we must have with our families, with those closest to us. A fourth type of harmony moves towards the left. That is the harmony we must have with our neighbours, our colleagues at work and those others who, without being very close to us, surround us. There is a fifth type of harmony which moves forward from us, and for the Aymara people that is harmony with the past. They believe that human beings face the past and not the future, because we can see what is in front of us, and the past is the only thing we can really see. A sixth type of harmony is behind us. That is our harmony with the future, because although we do not see the future we have an intuition about it and a sense of it. Often, although it has not yet come, we can already feel its weight on our shoulders. The seventh and final type of harmony is self- harmony, an inner harmony. If we achieve harmony in those seven areas, we will have a harmonious body, a harmonious country and a harmonious world. It is with that vision that we have begun to govern in Ecuador; and I believe it is with that vision that the United Nations is doing its work. We can discuss many issues here. I want to focus on two, both related to left-sided harmony — harmony with our neighbours, international harmony — and their implications for the development of our peoples. In Latin America, as in many parts of the world, we face one of the gravest crises in our history. We have been considering the advantages of globalization. Now we are also suffering the problems of globalization. When we speak of a global system, we speak of a real network, which, like a large cobweb, encompasses us all. The problem with such a network is that wherever we touch or apply pressure to the web we produce a vibration and an impact throughout the web. The great majority of the countries of Latin America have made enormous efforts to overcome the problems of previous decades. They have worked to reduce their fiscal deficits to a minimum, to open up to the global economy, to participate in trade and to share the principles of open, fair and transparent trade, free of discrimination. They have understood that integration is the tool for progress in the future. They have established regional markets, and now they seek a continental market. After so much effort, which at times has been costly in internal terms, we have found that that effort can be wasted, that it may not be a way out of our problems, because of an international crisis, which did not originate in our countries; it came from outside, but because of globalization, and the network connecting us, we are all affected. We understand the mechanics of the system. We understand how something that affects markets in Asia has an impact on Latin America. Yet, while we understand the mechanics of the system, we cannot see its fairness. If while working together we encounter problems that do not originate in our region, we must ask the industrialized countries in particular to take decisions that will ensure that not all the countries of the world suffer to the extent that we are suffering now. There is talk of risk of a global recession as severe as, or even more severe, than that of the 1930s. We see the stock markets of the largest countries of our region affected daily. We see a crisis that is already striking the industrialized countries. I think this is the appropriate forum for us to consider the need to work together. We small countries like Ecuador can do little in a crisis of this magnitude but call for reflection and true fraternity among our nations so that a problem affecting the whole world can be overcome. Otherwise, a crisis as big as this leaves many of us with no option but to wait and see how we can protect ourselves against these troubles. The countries of Latin America see ourselves as a region, and we believe we must behave as a region. Every country has its own characteristics and has to do what is necessary individually, but it is the region as a whole that is being affected by all these changes. The countries of Latin America have not come here simply to ask for money and loans, as they have done at other times of crisis. The countries of the region have not appeared here one by one to try to overcome their difficulties on an individual basis, as on other occasions. This time we have made joint proposals — just, global proposals. We hope these proposals will yield results. All analysts maintain that unless interest rates are lowered, in particular in the industrialized countries, this global trend is undoubtedly not going to change. The 0.25 per cent drop in interest rates was widely considered important but insufficient in view of the magnitude of the current crisis. It is therefore crucial that we deal with this matter here in the Assembly. Along with this international crisis, Ecuador is confronting an issue that is fundamental to its development: its relations with Peru, and the search for a definitive peace with Peru. We have a problem that has been dragged out over many decades. In its most recent stage, for the last 56 years, we have had a protocol of peace, friendship and boundaries, which should now enter a definitive phase. Peace is our objective; we see it as an ethical, moral and economic good. Nothing is more advantageous to the budgets of our countries than peace. We can do great things for the benefit of our economies. In this case, peace is accompanied by a set of incentives, specifically, the possibility of $3 billion in loans from multilateral entities for border development projects, irrigation, roads, agricultural systems, schools and health centres, to give a few examples. This $3 billion — a very large sum for both countries — can be put into action if we achieve peace. Over the past three years, we have been holding talks. Commissions have reached agreements on border integration, trade, navigation in the extraordinarily important basin of the Amazon river and measures of security and confidence-building for the future. But the 2 most delicate and difficult issue has yet to be resolved: the establishment of the borderline between the two countries. We have held talks at a number of levels — among our Foreign Ministers, in the negotiating commissions, among the countries that are guarantors of the protocol — and these conversations have also risen to the level of the presidencies of Peru and Ecuador. We have had three meetings in less than two months in order to seek that final agreement. Last night, I spoke with President Fujimori; he is planning to travel to the United States, and we agreed that tomorrow we will see each other here in New York for a fourth meeting to try to continue seeking the definitive formula that will resolve the question of our border in a way that is fitting, acceptable to the two countries and appropriate for our peoples. The principles are clear. As countries, we cannot enter the twenty-first century dragging with us problems that date back to the nineteenth. We must embark on the twenty-first century with a clear and positive vision that is directed towards the future. We share all the tenets of the United Nations on issues related to this one. We are completely in agreement with the Ottawa Convention on the question of landmines. Our country signed that Convention, and at the end of last week in Brasilia, the Presidents of Peru and Ecuador submitted to President Cardoso of Brazil a joint communiqué requesting that plans be drawn up for the removal of all the landmines that have been placed in the border area over the years. This is a positive and very real step; it means that the Convention will not simply be signed and ratified but will also be applied in practical terms in the field. We are also completely in agreement with the proposals of the United Nations on the reduction of military budgets and expenditures. We believe that money should be invested in poverty reduction and in the social programmes and projects our peoples need so much. We are completely in agreement with the conventional disarmament programmes. We believe that trust must replace distrust, and we believe that this task, accomplished jointly, can allow us to leave behind long decades of mutual suspicion and the great scepticism that sometimes pervades our countries. We are in agreement as regards general and complete disarmament. We agree with the prohibition of nuclear weapons. We welcome the decision of the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) to make all the countries of that region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone. We believe in peace, and we are working to achieve it. It will be hard to find, in the future, two Presidents of neighbouring countries with a history of problems who are so firmly committed to peace, so deeply convinced that they must achieve peace, and so zealously at work to reach a speedy, just and honourable peace. We hope our efforts will soon meet their reward. We completely support the initiatives of the United Nations on the subject of the protection of human rights. Ecuador has adopted its own national human rights plan into law. We are the second country in Latin America, and one of the first in the world, to adopt such a plan. It is not a plan of the Ecuadorian Government, but a plan made by Ecuadorian society, coordinated by the Ministry with the participation of representatives of various sectors of the society. We believe in human rights, and we defend them in their entirety and without reservation. Our Minister for Foreign Affairs was the first United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights before joining our Ministry for Foreign Relations, so our support in this field is complete. In addition, we are concerned about the issue of sustainable development, and we will vigorously promote environmental issues. For the first time in history, a woman from a country that is not in the northern hemisphere has become chairperson of the world’s largest intergovernmental organization on the environment. That woman’s name is Yolanda Kakabadse, and she is the present Minister of the Environment in Ecuador. We seek to indicate several things by this, which are easily understandable in what I have just said. These are the central issues in the link between the United Nations and my country: peace, the international crisis and the search for a just global accord, the environment and human rights. Other issues could be taken up, but I prefer to focus on this message. I believe that there is no better way to pay tribute to the United Nations and to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights than for two countries with democratically elected Governments to seek peace and endeavour to sign a peace agreement — perhaps sign one this year — so that the development of our peoples can proceed and their quality of life can improve. In this way we can sum up the most important human rights. Democracy, freedom, development, life, the right to work, gender-related issues, the problems of minorities and the most disadvantaged groups and the protection of children are encompassed in these words that are so simple and so important: peace, development and international cooperation. We want to emphasize these ideas here, in this Organization which has done so much to bring them about throughout the world. I wish the Assembly every success in its work for the benefit of all of humanity.  On behalf of the Foreign Minister of Australia, Mr. Alexander Downer, who is unable to be here because of our national election next 23 week, I would like to extend warm congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. Your country, Uruguay, has given consistent and strong support to the United Nations, and your own expertise and contribution to the development of international law in particular is widely recognized. We know that we are in good hands, just as we were last year with your predecessor, Hennadiy Udovenko. Like him, you may count on Australiaâs support as you carry out your responsibilities and work to guide us towards constructive and worthwhile outcomes. As was very clear from the range of issues addressed on the first day and again this morning in the general debate, you take up the presidency, Sir, at a time when the agenda before the United Nations is more challenging than it has ever been. Australia is very concerned about many of those challenges and issues. But today I want to focus particularly on the subject of non-proliferation and disarmament, where recent events have brought us to a crossroads in our attempts to steer the world away from the threat of weapons of mass destruction. Although we heard some pessimistic perspectives yesterday, in Australiaâs view the progress that the international community has made in the field of arms control and disarmament over recent decades has, in fact, been remarkable â€” a trend to which the end of the cold war lent added impetus. Many bilateral, regional and international agreements have been concluded, all making a contribution to making our world more secure. Those achievements were driven by the realization that we must work with determination towards a situation where the right to self-defence of all nations, which is, after all, enshrined in the United Nations Charter, must be ensured at the lowest possible level of conventional armament and without recourse at all to weapons of mass destruction. Events which have moved against the tide of this progress have been relatively rare, but when they have occurred they have stood in stark contrast to the preferred direction of the international community. A survey of the progress made to date in the field of arms control and disarmament points to two key conclusions. The first is self-evident: there is more work to be done. The second is perhaps easier to overlook. In the face of periodic setbacks and challenges, it is vitally important, and in the security interests of all countries, that we stay the course on arms control and disarmament, that we not underestimate or take for granted the value of what has been achieved to date, and that we maintain the broad- based political commitment to the norms and institutions that we have put in place or have yet to build. A stock-take of progress in arms control and disarmament over recent decades leaves no doubt about the positive direction in which the community is moving in building a global security architecture. In addition to agreements on conventional arms limitation and transparency measures, the balance sheet for weapons of mass destruction is particularly impressive. A Treaty banning an entire category of weapons of mass destruction â€” the Chemical Weapons Convention â€” was successfully negotiated and has attracted widespread support, and efforts are under way to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention. A milestone Treaty now exists â€” the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) â€” which bans all nuclear-weapon test explosions and all other nuclear explosions. Long called-for by political leaders from across all regions, hard-negotiated in the Conference on Disarmament and finally adopted by the Assembly by an overwhelming majority two years ago, the CTBT has now attracted the adherence of over 150 States, and its institutional fabric is being steadily established. The cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime â€” the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) â€” has been extended indefinitely and has achieved near-universal membership, and agreement has been reached to commence negotiations to ban the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons. In another area, under the strategic arms reductions process, or START, and consistent with article VI of the NPT, deep cuts have been made in the cold-war arsenals of the two largest possessors of nuclear weapons, bringing closer the day when plurilateral and multilateral phases of nuclear disarmament can realistically be envisaged. With START I almost fully implemented, the United States and the Russian Federation, from which we have just heard, have more than halved their holdings of strategic nuclear warheads over the past decade. START III will bring those same arsenals down to some 80 per cent below cold-war peaks. It is clearly very important for START II to enter into force quickly so that planning for implementation can begin, ensuring there is no interruption to the nuclear disarmament process. The international nuclear safeguards systems have also been strengthened, enhancing international confidence in the integrity of this regime and its ability to detect and 24 deter non-compliance with non-proliferation obligations. And finally, a treaty banning landmines â€” what some have called weapons of mass destruction in slow motion â€” has been concluded. On the other side of the ledger, the non-proliferation and disarmament regimes have had to withstand serious challenges from the Democratic Peopleâs Republic of Korea and from Iraq, and the progress towards a universal no- nuclear-testing norm has been seriously jolted by sporadic outbreaks of testing, most recently by India and Pakistan. Unresolved regional tensions in South Asia and the Middle East continue to bedevil and to thwart the attainment of the goal of universal membership of the NPT. While being justifiably dismayed at the disdain of the few for the clearly expressed will of the international community, we can also draw encouragement from the strength of our national and collective responses to these challenges and the resilience of the regimes when so challenged. It is vitally important that we stay the course, that we ensure that such events amount to no more than temporary deviations from the near-universally accepted norm against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We believe that this is in Australiaâs national interest and in the interest of international and regional security to uphold the nuclear and other non-proliferation regimes and to continue to do our utmost to pursue effective measures to reduce and eliminate the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction. In a strange way, the periodic setbacks to these efforts serve to underscore the value of the progress made to date. The very existence of the NPT, and its near-universal membership, highlights the unacceptability of embarking upon a nuclear-weapon programme in todayâs world. Similarly, it is the very existence of the CTBT, and the near-universal point of view it represents â€” namely, that nuclear testing should be a thing of the past â€” that rendered more powerful the widespread disapproval of the spate of nuclear tests earlier this year. The new ratifications which the CTBT attracted following the South Asian nuclear tests were eloquent testimony to the confidence of the international community in and its commitment to the no-testing norm. Australia would like to take this public opportunity to congratulate Brazil and to welcome it as the most recent member of the family of NPT nations. We call on that handful of States remaining outside the NPT to reflect on the possibility that the 187 countries which have decided that the NPT provides greater security than the nuclear- weapons option might be right, and that they â€” the outsiders â€” might be wrong. Australia also calls on them to consider how much more seriously their national security interests would be degraded in a world where the overwhelming majority of States had not embraced the nuclear non-proliferation norm. My country, as I think is well known, has long been a very firm supporter of universal adherence to treaties on international weapons of mass destruction. We have signed all 13 multilateral arms control and disarmament treaties and ratified all of these bar one; ratification of the Ottawa Convention on landmines, I am happy to say, is in progress. Only four other countries can match this record. We remain committed to making a difference where and when we can in building consensus on the way forward, and we will continue to be as diligent and as creative as possible across the full range of arms-control and disarmament issues. Our focus, for those who know us well, is always on results rather than rhetoric and on making pragmatic contributions where we can, illustrated by the sort of contributions that we have made to helping to negotiate the key Conventions to which I have referred and by our support for building and strengthening the institutions which work in various ways to support international arms- control and disarmament goals â€” institutions such as the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO), the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum and the nuclear safeguards system. Experience has shown that these regimes cannot be taken for granted. The existing regimes need continual care, maintenance and vigilance to ensure that they remain effective and that political and financial commitment to them remains strong. In the NPT area, for example, further work is needed to maintain the strength of the Treaty and to go on to achieve its full implementation and universality. The sixth Review Conference, in the year 2000, following on the recent serious challenges to the non-proliferation norm, to which I have referred, will be one of the most significant in the history of the Treaty. But even if we have a distance to go in terms of the Treatyâs value, surely no one would argue that the world would be a safer place without it. Nor could it be argued that the negotiation of the Treaty back in the late 1960s, and the maintenance and strengthening of the Treaty ever since, has not been worth the effort. 25 And to those few who persist with the tired refrain that the NPT is a discriminatory Treaty, we say â€œYes, it isâ€, and for one excellent reason: the NPT allows a temporary state of discrimination between the nuclear-weapon States and the rest of us because, quite simply, the alternative was, and still is, too horrible to contemplate. We might lament that because of the cold war the state of discrimination lasted far too long, but we surely cannot argue that the alternative scenario would have made the world a safer place than it is today. For it was a commonplace of political forecasts in the 1960s, when nuclear weapons were a legitimate security option for any State, that over 20 States, including my own, Australia, would likely choose to exercise that option. And it is surely perverse, when the titanic arsenals of nuclear weapons accumulated during the cold war are at last being drastically cut, to act against the tide of disarmament by pursuing the nuclear option. Similarly, no one could argue that we would be better off without a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Its conclusion, its signature by the five nuclear-weapon States and its ratification to date by two are major achievements â€” all the more reason to press ahead with the establishment of the Treatyâs implementation and verification structures. A strong start has been made in implementing the Chemical Weapons Convention. Its effectiveness is already amply demonstrated, but we need continued political will and financial commitment, as well as the additional ratifications and accessions, for the full security benefits of the Convention to be realized. Similarly, the Biological Weapons Convention is weakened by its lack of verification and compliance provisions. Work is now under way in the Ad Hoc Group negotiations to rectify this deficiency. We strongly support this Ad Hoc Group and are working together with others to produce an effective and workable protocol to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention. One of the things that we have been doing â€” and people may have seen the reference to a meeting about this in todayâs Journal â€” has been to work collaboratively with many other countries to convene an informal meeting of Foreign Ministers. This informal meeting is going to be held tomorrow, here in New York, and it represents the determination of many countries, at high political levels, to work together to bring us closer to the goal of an early conclusion of an effective protocol to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention. In conjunction with the international communityâs efforts to achieve full implementation and universality of existing regimes, we also need new, reinforcing and complementary steps to achieve our overall arms control and disarmament goals. Commencement of negotiations for a fissile material cut-off treaty is an excellent example of how we should be moving forward in this respect. We see it as the next logical step after the CTBT, and it is one to which we hope the Assembly will lend unequivocal support and encouragement. The recent agreement in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to commence negotiations on a cut-off treaty demonstrates, we believe, the resilience of the non-proliferation regime under pressure. It gives the lie to those who recently pronounced it dead. It is a sign of the international community reaffirming its faith in the non-proliferation principle to which it has been committed for the past 30 years. I want to refer very briefly to three more subjects: United Nations reform, human rights and peacekeeping. Like most other Member States, we want this Organization to work better. Some progress has been made. We welcomed the agreement reached on key elements of the Secretary-Generalâs reform package. Indeed, we worked hard and quietly to help bring this about. But it is now very important to ensure that what has been agreed is effectively implemented â€” that the task force and the reviews of specific aspects of United Nations organizations all actually produce concrete outcomes and that real change does in fact occur. Critical to the achievement of real reform will be the resolution of the ongoing problem of non-payment of arrears in financial contributions. The failure of many Member States, including the major contributor, to address this situation hinders all our efforts to strengthen this Organization. Also, much of the reform process to us appears to have been focused on rationalizing and refining structures and mechanisms and on administrative measures. We think that the next phase of the reform process has to give much more structured thought â€” and I believe that this is what the Secretary-General has in mind in his presentations to date on the Millennium Assembly â€” to the kind of United Nations we expect and want in the decades to come. A thorough review of priorities is overdue. Although the lofty ideals enshrined in the United Nations Charter remain as valid as ever, we need to give serious thought to modernizing the ways in which we 26 give effect to those objectives in terms of operational activities. Australia is concerned, like so many others who have spoken in the general debate to date, that the debate on Security Council reform has stalled. We have had an exhaustive â€” but, regrettably, inconclusive â€” discussion over the last year. It is time now to move beyond general discussion to serious negotiation of a reform package, one which will usher in a remodelled Council that is more representative, transparent and suited to the new millennium. This will require serious engagement and flexibility from all involved. My Government remains committed to finding ways to move the debate forward. Those of you who were here at last yearâs session of the General Assembly may recall that Foreign Minister Downer raised the issue of electoral groups. We continue to assert that this is an important element in the reform debate. It is over 30 years since the last significant change was made to the regional groups. The drawbacks of the present configuration are becoming more and more obvious: substantial disparities in the size of the various groups and an inadequate level of representation available to many subregions, including Australiaâs own geographical area of East Asia and the Pacific. We have noted that there is gathering interest among Member States in this subject, and we think it is time that we recognized it as an element of reform which needs to be addressed. Changing the groups to reflect better contemporary realities and the interests of the current membership will, we recognize, require careful thought and patient discussion, and it is simply far too early to put forward any particular formula. But we suggest we could begin by discussing the principles on which a new system could be built and by exchanging views in a thoughtful and non-acrimonious way on how we might take the process forward. The year 1998 marks the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and also 50 years of United Nations peacekeeping. Australiaâs commitment to upholding the fundamental human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights remains as strong now as it was in 1948, when the Declaration was proclaimed. Members may not know that Australia was one of the eight countries tasked with the drafting of the Declaration and that we also played an important role in ensuring that human rights provisions were included in the United Nations Charter. Fifty years ago, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights represented a common statement of goals and aspirations, a vision of the world as the international community would want it to become. We still believe in that vision and we see the fiftieth anniversary as a time for the international community to reaffirm its commitment to this powerful document. Similarly, the 50 years of United Nations peacekeeping gives us an opportunity to recognize how far the institution of peacekeeping has come, to take stock of the lessons we have learnt from the past and, perhaps most importantly, to pay tribute to over 1,500 peacekeepers who have made the ultimate sacrifice for a safer and more peaceful world. Whether we are talking of old problems or new ones, whether we are analysing setbacks or successes, or marking anniversaries, the annual stocktake which this general debate represents offers the opportunity not for a series of set speeches unrelated to each other and ticking off a lot of subjects, but rather a chance to remind ourselves of what the United Nations stands for, to recognize what has been achieved to date, and to recommit ourselves for the future to protecting and advancing those achievements. I have focused today on disarmament not only as an area of the utmost priority for Australia and Australians, but also as one where we believe we can add value. But the parallels and lessons of disarmament and non- proliferation hold good for other areas of the United Nations activities. I said at the very outset that the international community was at a crossroads in our attempts to build an international dispensation in which the threat of mass destruction had no place. The achievements of the last 30 years in setting in place treaties, institutions and norms to ensure that we move in that direction are impressive. But they are not invulnerable. Inadequate verification, non- compliance, aberrant behaviour, budget fatigue, reform fatigue failure of political will â€” all of these things have the potential to unravel and to undermine what we have built together. Effective arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation â€” like all the other subjects that are being addressed from this rostrum â€” require large investments of political and economic capital. It might be natural at times, particularly challenging and worrying times such as we are currently experiencing, to wonder if it is worth the cost. Brief consideration of the alternatives is surely enough to convince us that the answer is undoubtedly â€œyesâ€. To do otherwise would be to betray not only the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which we are commemorating, but also the very principles of the United Nations Charter.  I speak to this Assembly with a sense of deference and humility. Deference, because I realize that I am speaking to the greatest multilateral organization of all time and from a rostrum where have stood almost all the great statesmen since the Second World War. Humility because I was appointed just two months ago to the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs, and so I am a newcomer for most of the delegates. However, this is no way detracts from the pride that I feel regarding my country?s long commitment to the United Nations system and the support that this Organization has enjoyed in the Kingdom of the Netherlands. I would also like to add that I feel reassured to realize that most of what I was going to say to the Assembly has already been said in the statement made by the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs on behalf of the European Union. (spoke in English) Article 23 of the United Nations Charter says that the General Assembly shall elect 10 non-permanent members of the Security Council. More to the point, the Article goes on to say that the Assembly, in doing so, must pay due regard “in the first instance to the contribution of Members of the United Nations to the maintenance of international peace and security and to the other purposes of the Organization”. Well, my country at present is up for election to the Security Council. In fact, elections are due to be held in this very Hall in a few weeks time. And so it seems only fair for the Kingdom of the Netherlands, as a candidate for the Council, to explain where it stands: where it stands on some of the core issues now faced by the United Nations family, where its stands on the state of affairs in the Organization and where it stands on the Organization?s future. In other words, what is the electorate looking at? What the electorate is looking at is what I would describe as a nation responding. Throughout the Kingdom people hear the wants of the world, the needs of our neighbours and of people in peril. It is in keeping with the Dutch character to be penny-pinching but generous to those in distress, to be demanding but tough on ourselves as well, to hold strong views but carry a big heart — easily critical, prone to compassion. In much the same manner we look at this Organization. We look at the Charter as a true monument of modern times. We feel a strong commitment to multilateralism, for reasons of principle and for reasons of necessity. We seek to promote the institutions of worldwide cooperation, with the United Nations at the core. Together, they span the entire range of human activity. We shall go on to give it the best we can offer in the form of ideas and in the form of resources. I would like to demonstrate how seriously we take our Charter obligations by showing how, over the years, we have pursued the purposes of the United Nations, as spelled out by the Charter in Article 1. First, peace and security. It is perhaps the most thankless responsibility the United Nations carries. Indeed, the odds are overwhelming. Since 1945, the number of violent conflicts outstanding has risen from 4 to about 40. Their average length has grown from about two months to an average of 14.5 months in 1995. Peace and security is where we have learned our lessons the hard way, and more mistakes are bound to be made. We, the Member States, need to shape up. Meanwhile, the Dutch commitment to United Nations peacekeeping is borne out by our record. The Netherlands has taken part in 20 peacekeeping operations so far, is currently engaged in three of them and is getting ready to join a fourth one. Most recently, some 100 Dutch troops were stationed in Cyprus, where they are committed to keeping the two Cypriot communities at peace. All in all, some 1,650 Dutch troops are engaged in peacekeeping and multinational supervision. In fact, peacekeeping operations continue to form one of the 25 principal tasks of our armed forces, and we remain ready to participate in up to four different peacekeeping efforts simultaneously at the level of a battalion. Peacekeeping does not stand by itself. There should be a comprehensive response to the need for conflict management. We believe in a continuum between prevention, on the one hand, and reconstruction and development on the other hand. After all, many of the conflicts raging today take place in the developing world. Affluent societies cannot in good conscience walk away from a conflict once the smoke has cleared. Donor countries cannot turn their backs to the ravages of war and concentrate on the next CNN headlines. We believe that emergency aid and political initiatives should be teamed with longer-term development planning, reconstruction and reconciliation. We believe in building a bridge between conflict and development. Another pillar of Dutch foreign policy is our strong desire to ban weapons of mass destruction. Our objective remains strengthening the non-proliferation regime, supporting real progress in negotiations on the reduction of nuclear weapons, and making existing conventions on other mega-weapons effective and more reliable. Still, we are not talking only about mega-weapons. The transfer of small arms is a matter of concern for us as well. They are piling up fast, most of them illicit. In many countries they constitute a serious threat to the population and to national and regional security and even contribute to the destabilization of States. Landmines are the plague of modern warfare, leaving a disgraceful legacy of the present century to the next one. Once in the ground, they keep. To this day people are maimed or killed in Ypres, Belgium, by landmines put in place during the first strategic use of them, over 80 years ago. Mine clearance and banning anti-personnel landmines have been pursued with renewed vigour in recent years, and with due reason. I now turn to the second of the purposes of the United Nations: developing friendly relations among nations. Let me point to the manner and measure in which the Netherlands has contributed towards this. By geographical necessity, the Netherlands has always been a seafaring nation, a nation of traders. Besides making us the eighth largest trading nation in the world, it has made us an outward-looking people, internationally oriented. Also, it has made us a multicultural society. Over 20 per cent of our population have their origins abroad — in Africa, in Asia, in the Arab world and in the Americas. Over time, we have built up strong relations with countries of all regions. Two constituent parts of our Kingdom, that is to say the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba, are located in the Americas. Our Caribbean Kingdom partners have important political and economic relations with their regional friends. They are engaged in the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), in the Organization of American States (OAS) and in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). Rightfully, Africa is high on the Netherlands? political and development agendas. We encourage and support African countries in establishing peace, stability and democracy. We assist African nations in building up their mechanism for conflict prevention, management and resolution. We help Africa in strengthening its place in the world economy — for instance, through the World Trade Organization. Dutch aid flows to all countries of Africa — last year over $600 million worth. Turning now to Asia, the relations between the Netherlands and a large number of Asian countries go back to the sixteenth century. We are an original member of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). Naturally, therefore, we have assisted Asian countries that have been hit by the financial crisis and its economic and social effects. We do so through multilateral channels and through joint European and Asian initiatives. Overcoming the crisis is important, too, for political stability in the region. As regards Central and Eastern Europe, the Netherlands is heavily engaged in assisting countries of that region in their transition to market economy and democracy. Our involvement is a central feature in our relations with all candidates for accession to the European Union. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are at present the third most important donor, and we contribute to the Stabilization Force and to various organizations engaged in the region. The Netherlands and the Arab world have long- standing economic and cultural ties. The University of Leyden has traditionally been a leading centre for the study of Islam and Arab culture. We have a growing Arab community in the Netherlands. We continue to give substantial support to the Palestinian people and are a 26 major donor to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. The third purpose of the United Nations, as spelt out in Article 1 of the Charter, is by far the most complex. Its binding element is the promotion of international cooperation, but cooperation in fields that, taken together, cover a wide range of human interaction. I would like to highlight some of them, without, of course, meaning to diminish any of the others. Notably, I will touch on development cooperation, human rights, and international law. Poverty eradication has been the primary focus of Dutch development aid policy for over a quarter of a century. The Netherlands, whose aid programme last year ran close to $3 billion, has actively tried to strike a balance in its aid policy between the economy, the environment and the people. We are pursuing development that is sustainable — sustainable not purely in terms of ecology but in a wider sense: development that addresses basic human needs, that respects human rights, that builds human capacities, that is socially responsible and that does not mortgage the choices of future generations. For many years, my country has been more than faithful to the international target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for development. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average hovers around 0.25 per cent. The Netherlands stands at a self- imposed 0.8 per cent. In percentage terms, it takes third place among the major donors. In absolute terms, in money spent, it has made us the sixth largest donor country worldwide for 1997. All in all, $750 million from Dutch resources flowed to the United Nations system and to the Bretton Woods institutions in 1997. The new Netherlands Government is a strong believer in multilateral development cooperation. In its first major policy statement, it pledged that multilateral aid flows, including those to the United Nations system, are going to be expanded over the next several years. As the Charter says explicitly, international cooperation applies also to promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. We have made no secret of our attachment to the cause of human rights in the past; nor do we intend to hide it in the years to come. The Netherlands has been an active player in the Commission on Human Rights since at least 1980, has seen several of its countrymen serve in prominent human rights positions, has either drafted or supported countless resolutions and has strongly advocated standard- setting and monitoring. It is a topic that enjoys solid support in Dutch society and has constituted a clear political imperative for a quarter of a century. Member States can count on our toeing the line in the future. Promoting respect for the rule of law at the international level has been recognized as part of our heritage ever since Hugo Grotius, in the early 1600s. In modern times, the Netherlands has sought to contribute to the advancement of international law. Areas where we have made contributions include human rights, legal cooperation, crime prevention, criminal justice and so forth. Much of the groundwork for the International Criminal Court was done under Dutch chairmanship. If indeed we are to serve on the Security Council, what will be our aims in the next two years? Our aim is the primacy of international law. Our aim is building bridges. Our aim is addressing all issues before the Council. Our aim is more contact between non-members and the Council. And our aim is openness and transparency. In a nutshell, we will be driven by idealism, but guided by realism. It is in that spirit that we approach our membership in the Council and, indeed, the future of this Organization.   Allow me first, Mr. President, to offer you my sincerest congratulations on your appointment, and to express my satisfaction that the work of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session will be led by such a distinguished representative of a country with which Spain has excellent relations. I should also like to thank Minister Udovenko for the efficiency with which he presided over the General Assembly during the previous session. The Foreign Minister of Austria has already set out the main elements of the European Union?s position in the United Nations. For my part, I should like to highlight certain issues of particular interest to Spain. It can generally be said that our Organization is today in a stronger position than in previous years, which were characterized by a predominant feeling of crisis. The major reforms undertaken will enable the United Nations to continue to be the main forum for international cooperation. Dialogue, the promotion of respect for human rights and the development of international life will continue under the auspices of the United Nations. Furthermore, the Organization has consolidated its primary function of maintaining international peace and security. An essential element of the strengthening process that the United Nations is currently undergoing is greater recognition of the limits that restrict its action. The process of reforming the Organization, which the Secretary-General has set in motion with decisiveness and determination, has contributed significantly to a sense of getting the Organization under control and of renewed confidence in its possibilities. Spain will follow this process very closely so as to support it and ensure that it is brought to a successful conclusion. The debate on enlarging the membership of the Security Council deserves separate consideration. The difficulties posed by enlarging the permanent membership have been confirmed as negotiations have proceeded. We must not attempt to force decisions that might create divisions within certain regional groups. Reform must reflect, as far as possible, general agreement between the Members of the Organization, and in any case it must respect the provisions of Article 108 of the Charter. We must therefore acknowledge that at present there is no realistic alternative to increasing only the number of non- permanent members. In order for our Organization to be able to perform satisfactorily its indispensable work, it must be endowed with sufficient funds. The Secretary-General is carrying out a major reform designed to ensure, among other aims, better use of the financial means made available to it by States. However, the current financial situation is very worrying, largely owing to the accumulation of arrears. No State should forget that full and timely payment of its contributions is a legally binding international obligation. In 1999, my country will become the eighth largest contributor to the Organization?s budget. We are fully aware of the responsibility this entails and are ready to assume it. With the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism about to end, I believe it is important to recall that the historic work carried out by the Organization in this field cannot be considered complete as long as there remain colonial situations such as the one which so painfully affects my country. I am referring, of course, to the question of Gibraltar. Every year the General Assembly renews its appeals to Spain and the United Kingdom to continue their negotiations with a view to putting an end to the colonial situation of Gibraltar. The current negotiation process stems from the so-called Brussels declaration of 1984, in which the Governments of our two States undertook to establish a negotiation process, to include sovereignty issues, in order to settle all their differences. During the 1997 negotiating round I submitted a proposal that would allow Spain to regain sovereignty over Gibraltar, while maintaining for the inhabitants of the Territory all their current benefits, granting them, in the framework of the Spanish State, a greater degree of political autonomy than they enjoy today, and agreeing, as an additional guarantee 26 of Spain?s good faith, to share sovereignty with the United Kingdom for a long transition period. I believe that that proposal should be able to form the basis of an agreement that would, once and for all, put an end to an anachronistic situation originating from the dynastic wars of the early eighteenth century. Respect for human rights is essential in guaranteeing the maintenance of international peace and security. Our Organization also plays a prominent role in this field. The commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights should provide a powerful incentive to continue to develop international instruments for protecting human rights. The adoption of the statute of the International Criminal Court during the recent Rome Conference marked a very significant step in that direction. Spain firmly supported the adoption of the statute, signed it on the first day, and is prepared to carry out any actions needed to ensure its prompt entry into force. Likewise, I wish to back the important work performed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and to underline the importance that my country attaches to the work of the Commission on Human Rights, to which it has presented its candidature for the period 2000 to 2002. Terrorism constitutes a serious threat to domestic and international security, to the development and functioning of democratic institutions throughout the world and to the exercise of human rights. Spain firmly believes in strengthening the machinery of international cooperation, for which the United Nations is a key forum. Spain, which has ratified all conventions adopted on this issue, has already signed the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and hopes that, as the next step, a convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism can be adopted. Similarly, Spain gives high priority to the international fight against drugs. This was evidenced by the Spanish Prime Minister?s attendance at the special session of the General Assembly in June, which was devoted to this universal problem and which contributed substantially to reaffirming our conviction that it is critical to consolidate international coordination in seeking global solutions based on the principles of shared responsibility, attention to sustainable development and boosting regional and interregional cooperation. Multilateral development cooperation and poverty eradication are crucial to the establishment of peaceful international coexistence based on respect for human rights. Spain is following with attention the implementation of the reform measures proposed by the Secretary-General. My Government praises the momentum the Secretary-General is giving to the reform of the environmental and human settlement sectors directly linked to development. My country is participating in studying new financing formulas to provide sufficient resources for development cooperation. In this regard, without losing sight of the unavoidable debate on budgetary matters, Spain will consider a possible gradual increase in its voluntary contributions over the next few years. On the subject of disarmament, Spain will shortly ratify the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti- Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction; it is pleased with the swift pace of ratification of the Convention. It is likewise of the utmost importance that next year we should succeed in concluding negotiations on a protocol on verification of biological weapons. As regards nuclear weapons, I cannot but express once again my concern at the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan, which go against the international community?s efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. Nevertheless, we are optimistic about the forthcoming commencement of negotiations on a treaty banning the production of fissile materials for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. Finally, we are confident that this progress can be further enhanced by India?s and Pakistan?s accession to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty. The chief aim of our Organization continues to be the maintenance of international peace and security. Here the United Nations increasingly uses the means that regional organizations or groups of States place at its disposal. As a result, its response to various crises is becoming more flexible and the legitimizing role of the United Nations now carries more weight. Some good examples, in addition to the Stabilization Force (SFOR) and Operation Alba — to cite two cases in which Spain respectively continues to play and played a particularly prominent role — are initiatives such as the Stand-by Forces High-Readiness Brigade (SHIRBRIG), which can 27 speed up United Nations intervention considerably, and in which Spain is also beginning to participate. Moreover, the mediation capacity of the Secretary-General and his representatives has been enhanced even further over the past year. In this connection, I wish to reaffirm my country?s commitment to the maintenance of international peace and security, in the service of which 2,000 Spaniards are currently serving. Indeed, in addition to participating in SFOR, the International Police Task Force (IPTF) and the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA), Spain this year sent a police contingent to the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA). Furthermore, Spain intends to sign soon a memorandum of understanding with the Secretariat to define the modalities for making stand-by forces available to the Organization. Humanitarian assistance operations have come to play an increasingly important role. Aid workers from many countries, including Spain, have lost their lives in these missions. For this reason, my country will continue to promote all measures that can help improve the security and safety of personnel providing humanitarian assistance. The ongoing process of globalization does not mean the disappearance of the diversity of civilizations and cultures, which coexist with increasing closeness. To the contrary, this diversity itself constitutes a value which must be used to promote solidarity and cooperation among nations. Indeed, serious crises — some of which I shall mention in this statement — continue to afflict the international community; unfortunately too, our ability to take action is still often limited. The situation in Africa is cause for serious concern, and justifies the special consideration our Organization is giving to African crises. Suffice it to mention the armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the tragic humanitarian crisis in Sudan — in the solution of which Spain is making a special effort to cooperate, the precarious situation of Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau, and the extremely serious exacerbation of tension in Angola, where UNITA must respect the Lusaka agreements and where the United Nations must continue to give its most valuable support to the peace process. In Western Sahara, the parties must continue to demonstrate their good will so that the referendum on self- determination envisaged in the Secretary-General?s settlement plan can be held. The coming months will undoubtedly be crucial. Spain will continue to back the Secretary-General, his representatives and the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). The situation in Kosovo is also extremely serious. Spain backs the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, but President Milosevic´ and his Government must understand that the international community will not remain impassive in the face of an indiscriminate use of force that is creating a very serious humanitarian problem. A sincere negotiation process should be established as soon as possible to enable Kosovo to regain the necessary political autonomy in Yugoslavia. In Latin America, the reconciliation process in Guatemala continues to make good headway, despite some tragic incidents, and is an inspiring example. We are confident that the ongoing talks in Colombia will lead to a process of national reconciliation, an objective to which Spain has been giving its fullest support. As regards the peace process in the Middle East, Spain is deeply concerned about the current standstill and actively backs the different initiatives presented, particularly the European Union proposals, to safeguard this process and implement the commitments already made by the parties. There is an urgent need to put an end to this conflict, which has already lasted too long; it implies a threat to stability, fundamentally in the Mediterranean, but with global repercussions. We must find a solution to achieve a long-lasting reconciliation of the Jewish, Christian and Islamic cultures. Spain is, to a great extent, an example of such reconciliation, and we stand ready to make all necessary efforts to achieve this goal. Lastly, in Asia, Spain is following with great concern the situation in Afghanistan. In another context, it is confident that the parties will succeed in reaching an agreement to form a Government in Cambodia after the recent elections. I firmly believe that, after a period of excessive and unjustified hopes and consequent disappointments, now is the time for the United Nations to forge determinedly ahead in fostering an international coexistence based on respect for human rights, justice and solidarity. Nonetheless, this will only be possible if it has the full support of all of us. Spain hereby reiterates its fullest commitment to the United Nations. 28   May I congratulate Mr. Opertti most warmly on his well-acclaimed election and express to him, on behalf of my Government, our full confidence and support for his presidency. We want also to pay tribute to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine for his commitment and determined leadership during the fifty-second session. At this stage of my statement, I am honoured to speak as Chairman of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and to do so on behalf of 32 AOSIS States that are Members of the United Nations. I take the opportunity from the outset to declare our heartfelt concerns and deepest feelings for the people and communities of the Caribbean and those bordering the Caribbean and in the southern parts of the United States who have lost families and properties or have been left homeless by hurricane Georges. We join in the call for the most generous assistance to them all. Several of the countries suffering severe damage and devastation — such as Antigua and Barbuda, Cuba, Saint Kitts and Nevis and the Virgin Islands — are AOSIS members, and we have them especially in our thoughts at this time. For our small island States, these climate-related events are occurring with alarming force and regularity. We have it from the experts that powerful hurricanes like Georges could be linked to the “cold event” of La Niña, the contrasting weather phenomenon to El Niño, and that La Niña may be setting conditions favourable to more frequent and dangerous Caribbean hurricanes like Georges. These were the same events described by the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea in his address to this Assembly last week, when he spoke of the damaging effects of El Niño, and by the Deputy Prime Minister of Fiji earlier today. They are events and disasters which demonstrate and underscore the extreme exposure and vulnerability of our island communities. AOSIS welcomed the action authorized by this Assembly last year towards early understanding of the El Niño phenomenon and its impacts, and we fully support the United Nations system-wide strategy now being developed. We welcome in particular the proposals initiated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to reduce the impact of environmental emergencies through early warning and preparedness, especially in the case of El Niño/Southern Oscillation. We note in this connection the importance of practical support for such initiatives, especially the generous financial donation from the Ted Turner Foundation. In Barbados in 1994, at the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, the international community recognized their special characteristics and needs and adopted a specific Programme of Action to address these needs. The United Nations Agenda for Development, adopted last year, reinforced the acknowledgement of special circumstances and stressed the need for international support to help island communities with their development efforts. The months ahead will be a critical time for our countries as we work towards the first five-year review of the Barbados Programme of Action next year at the two- day special session of the General Assembly. The review will be carried out against the background of the appraisal of Agenda 21 and the assessment arrived at by the world?s political leadership then that the overall trends with respect to sustainable development are worse today than they were in 1992. The conclusions of the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) at its sixth session earlier this year, which reviewed several chapters of the Barbados Programme of Action, highlighted the continued 7 vulnerability of small island developing States, particularly to climate change, and the critical need for capacity- building in such areas as the management of wastes; freshwater biological resources; and science and technology. Placing priority on human resource development and the transfer of appropriate environmentally sound technologies are essential. Our national institutions and administrative capacities have been hampered by a severe lack of financial and technical skills, and the use of regional institutions and mechanisms for coordination needs to be strengthened or supplemented. We look forward to engaging the international community in detailed dialogue on these aspects at the donors? conference next February and during the other review preparatory processes next year. In doing so, let there be no doubt about our own determination in the matter, for the primary responsibility for the success of the Barbados Programme of Action lies with the small island developing States, first and foremost. We will not be sidetracked from the ultimate prize of self-reliance, but we must be assured of the vital support of the international community. The AOSIS countries continue to set high priority on the development of the vulnerability index and will follow with close attention the quantitative and analytical work which we believe must continue on the index. Recognition within the Barbados Programme of Action that small island developing States are a special case is further supported by the work of the ad hoc expert group on vulnerability indices, which reported to the Economic and Social Council earlier in the year. AOSIS takes particular note of the conclusion of the experts that, as a group, small island States are more vulnerable than other groups of developing countries. Looking to 1999 and the work of the Commission on Sustainable Development, we warmly welcome the election of the Minister of Environment of New Zealand, The Honourable Simon Upton, as Chairman of the CSD at its seventh session and look forward to a successful year of consultations under his leadership. The agenda for the Commission?s seventh session is full and an extremely important one: oceans, our heritage; sustainable tourism, so important to our future; and patterns of consumption and production, for we know all too well the need to change if our children are to have adequate and right choices for their own future. We hope that all States will take full advantage of the continued constructive dialogue that we have had in the past and which we expect during the Commission?s seventh session and the preparations for the review of the Barbados Programme of Action. The special session next year will provide an excellent opportunity to agree on the next steps to implement the Programme of Action, and to explore in a focused way the many difficulties which remain. It is no accident that the first chapter of the Barbados Programme of Action deals with climate change and that it leads off with a clear statement that small island developing States are particularly vulnerable to climate change, climate variability and sea-level rise. Indeed, the assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is that small island States are the least able to adapt to the impacts of climate change. We remain at the front line of this issue, an issue not of our making, and one that calls for urgent and concerted international action. With the passing of each season, small island States experience ever more serious impacts, and practical steps must now be taken to assist them, especially with the adaptation options that are available. The impacts of climate change put at risk habitats and fresh-water reserves, the very life force of our islands and communities, and thus the need for AOSIS to restate once again our profound concerns. As the globe suffers what is on track to be the hottest year in recorded history, it is essential that the international community as a whole be formally and unequivocally reminded that neither the efforts made thus far in implementing the Framework Convention on Climate Change nor the emissions reduction targets, on average 5.2 per cent, adopted in Kyoto last year, represent an adequate effort to stabilize greenhouse gases concentrations in the atmosphere at safe levels. We know from the IPCC reports that we need to do much more, and to do it immediately, by cuts of emissions of up to 60 per cent and more. There is emerging scientific evidence, supported by experience in almost every part of the world, that climate change is indeed taking effect, with devastating impacts, from the forest fires of South-East Asia to the extra severe and unprecedented flooding in China and Bangladesh, to the blistering heat of the American summer. These events, backed by science, must continue to drive the development of the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol. Developed country parties have an acknowledged historical role and remain primarily responsible for the 8 accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and they must be the first to accept the responsibility to redress the situation. They possess the skills and the capacity effectively to do so now. It is not sufficient per se to point to the new mechanisms created by the Kyoto Protocol, for there are numerous uncertainties concerning the new mechanisms. They are supplemental to domestic actions and they need rules for governance and compliance. Nor is it sufficient to say that developed country actions are conditional on developing country commitments. In the judgement of the AOSIS countries, such commitments must be allowed to evolve over time and in line with a common but differentiated principle, as well as the other fundamental principles of the Convention. There cannot be any doubt as to the major importance of the first steps taken in Kyoto, and of the quantum improvements brought about by the provisions of the Protocol. Notwithstanding the uncertainties I have referred to, we see a clear obligation on all parties to make every genuine effort towards early entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol and the implementation of its provisions. The size and the urgency of the problem require this of us all. It is the intent of the AOSIS countries to apply themselves in every positive and constructive way to help clarify such uncertainties. In this manner, we have submitted our suggestions and proposals in respect of several agenda items and in connection with the preparations for the fourth conference of the parties in Buenos Aires. We would need to acknowledge that the science on climate change is imperfect and incomplete. But the fact that we do not know everything is not a reason for ignoring the evidence which does exist. In this connection, we are concerned by the actions of certain industry interests which seem yet again to be determined on undermining the existing credible and universally acknowledged scientific findings, findings of the IPCC and others on this matter, and so to work in a negative way to influence public opinion. Climate change is far too serious and too urgent a concern for all humanity to be the subject of such manipulation. May I now turn briefly to address some additional issues which are of particular importance to my country, Samoa. First, we are deeply grateful to Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, for his leadership and for the reform process he has initiated. Samoa fully supports the ongoing efforts to strengthen and revitalize our Organization to better position it for the challenges of the new era. We need to say, though, that it does not accord with any real sense of commitment to look to the Secretary-General for performance, while denying him and the Organization the means to do so. We, like so many other Governments, must repeat the call for all arrears to be made good, and for all contributions to be paid in full, on time and without qualification. We are especially concerned about the failure, thus far, in reform measures for the Security Council and measures to deal with its current composition. Membership of the Council must be enlarged in both categories to reflect the realities of the present time and to enhance the Council?s effectiveness and legitimacy. We think the situation of Japan and Germany deserves special consideration. We believe very deeply in the sustaining power of international law in support of the Charter principles. The United Nations has been a necessary and a cohesive force in the elaboration of international law and rules for international cooperation, which now regulate a phenomenal range of human activity. An important and often overlooked fact is the comparatively high rate of State party adherence to international instruments and the acceptance of a wide range of obligations, whether on the environment, social development, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons or in so many other areas. The latest example would appear to be the Ottawa anti-personnel mines Convention, an unprecedented global achievement, which my own country has ratified, and which, by action of the international community, is soon to come into force. It is essential that all countries, large and small, take part in the creation of these rules for international conduct and behaviour. For small States, they constitute, ultimately, the most effective measure of protection. Samoa was able to play a role in the Rome negotiations for the establishment of the International Criminal Court, and is a signatory of its Statute. We believe that the Court will contribute significantly to the international legal order and security, for it offers, for the first time, effective responses to serious crimes of international concern: genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression. The challenge now is to bring the Statute into force and to implement its provisions. We all have a duty to see to this, at the earliest moment. As the Secretary General has said, it is an opportunity to take a monumental step in the name of human rights and the rule of law. Let me note here our welcome for the recent and very important findings and decision of the International Tribunal for Rwanda in 9 respect of the offences of genocide and crimes against humanity. Our Pacific region is one of peace, and we treasure our peace. But our security and environment have been put under threat by explosions and the testing of far too many nuclear weapons. We will continue with our quest for a total ban through the development and the implementation of the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty, the second oldest of the international regional arrangements, and we call for the active participation and support of all nuclear- weapon States for the Treaty and its protocols. In like manner, we will give solid backing to all international efforts towards the final elimination of these weapons, in particular, the resolutions of this House on the landmark Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice concerning the obligation to pursue in good faith and to bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects. Samoa condemns all testing of nuclear weapons, as we did the underground testing in the South Asia region earlier in the year. However, we have heard in this Hall encouraging statements by India and Pakistan, and we join others in urging that they commit to a lasting moratorium by becoming parties to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty (CTBT) and that they adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Let me say also that we applaud Brazil?s accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We welcome these positive developments most warmly. The United Nations remains a significant part of the modern development and progress of my country. It is with complete faith that we renew our commitment to the Charter. We do so as a small country and with abiding trust in the principles of the Charter and the most supportive concern for the welfare of the Organization.   Let me begin by joining previous speakers in extending my personal congratulations and those of my delegation to you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. You assume the leadership of this Assembly at a time when the global agenda demands much of us all. I assure you of the full support and cooperation of the Jamaican delegation as you guide the work of this Assembly to what I am confident will be a successful conclusion. I wish also to thank Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine for the effective manner in which he discharged his responsibilities as President of the Assembly during his tenure. The Secretary-General deserves our praise for his outstanding leadership of the Organization during the past year. I congratulate him in particular on the successes achieved through the quiet methods of preventive diplomacy which he employed on sensitive issues affecting international peace and security. We welcome his report, which contains a thoughtful overview of the complex challenges facing the international community, and we applaud the institutional reforms thus far introduced, which have sought to bring greater coherence and efficiency to the work of the United Nations. We also endorse the reorganization of the work programme, which brings renewed focus to the initiatives of central importance to the United Nations: those in the areas of peace and security, development cooperation, social development and humanitarian affairs. We consider it essential that the membership of the United Nations support the efforts of the Secretary- General in the implementation of this programme of work. Such support should be extended not only by endorsement of the range of activities being undertaken in fulfilment of our mandates, but also through the regular commitment of resources for their execution. Our presence here is an acknowledgement of the universality of many of the problems we face, and our membership in this Organization is a demonstration of our conviction that these problems are best solved through collective action. This should lead us to reaffirm our support for multilateralism and our respect for its processes through the timely payment, without preconditions, of our assessed contributions to the respective United Nations bodies. In recent years, the international community has witnessed a disturbing increase in the number of conflicts within and between States. The stable peace anticipated at the end of the cold war has been elusive. Instead, we have watched as efforts to resolve ongoing regional disputes unravel because of obduracy, mistrust and hostility. We have watched as intolerance and hatred have 3 divided communities and fuelled conflicts across the continents. We are concerned that despite the intervention of the Secretary-General, his envoys and the membership of the United Nations, there is still no real progress towards peace in a number of long-standing disputes. We share the international community’s concern that the peace process in the Middle East has been stalled, and we are disappointed that there is still no substantial progress on the long-standing problem in Cyprus. Hostilities in Afghanistan continue unabated, civil wars still rage in the Sudan and Angola and violence in Kosovo has escalated. New complications have arisen to increase instability and conflict in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa. These unresolved conflicts undermine the political, economic and social fabric of the States concerned, bringing destruction and untold human suffering to the victims of war. We cannot afford to drift into complacency while increasing numbers of the world’s people are destroyed, dispossessed and despoiled by war. In the face of this, we should strengthen our resolve to stand against aggression and the use of force, and to support the resolution of disputes and conflicts through negotiated settlements. We encourage Member States to support the Secretary-General’s initiative for strengthening the capability of the United Nations to deal with conflict resolution, prevention and early warning. I also wish to use this opportunity to commend the United Nations peacekeeping forces for the great contribution which they continue to make to the maintenance of peace, notwithstanding the difficult circumstances in which they work. We are deeply distressed at the increasing acts of violence directed against international peacekeeping personnel. I wish to pay special tribute to these volunteers, some of whom have given their lives, for their sacrifice in the cause of peace. The Charter of the United Nations invests in the Security Council the principal authority for multilateral decision-making in matters affecting international peace and security. We are therefore concerned at the tendency of States to take unilateral action which they deem to be in their national interest in situations of conflict with other nations. Jamaica reaffirms its confidence in the principle of collective security, on which the role of the Security Council is predicated. It is also important that the actions of the Council inspire confidence and that there be greater openness and transparency in its working methods. We believe that, like any other international body, the Security Council should undergo a process of democratic reform if it is effectively to meet the new challenges of an ever changing world. We are committed to working as equal partners with the rest of the international community to strengthen the capacity of the Security Council to respond to the needs of Member States in matters of peace and security. To that end, my Government has presented its candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Council for the period 2000-2001. My Government attaches importance to the fact that the long awaited International Criminal Court, which the Secretary-General described as the missing link in the international legal system, has now been constituted by an internationally agreed Statute. We commend the Government of Trinidad and Tobago for taking the initiative in calling for its establishment. That institution will provide a framework for the legal expression of international opposition to the terrible crimes being perpetrated against humanity which the United Nations had not been able to address effectively. This year the international community celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As we commemorate this important milestone, we should affirm our commitment to the ideals of tolerance, peace and understanding for all peoples. Let us also demonstrate mutual respect for each other’s right to self-determination, including the right to choose one’s own path for achieving national goals, and the right to sustainable development. There can be no doubt that peace and security are prerequisites for the attainment of sustainable development. It is equally true, however, that where there is economic and social deprivation, there can be no real peace. Jamaica therefore strongly endorses the right to development as an integral part of fundamental human rights and underscores the important contribution which realization of this right would make to the fuller enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. In this regard, we welcome the report of the Secretary- General on progress being made in the elaboration of a strategy for the implementation and promotion of the right to development. 4 We continue to look to the United Nations system for support of our development agenda, which goes beyond our effort to gain fair access to international markets and to secure a just and equitable share of global prosperity. Central to improving the welfare of our people must be measures to alleviate and ultimately eradicate poverty and to promote environmental protection and sustainable development. We need to strengthen our institutional framework for capacity-building and we need to invest in development of our human resources. This is our people-centred vision for development, and we recognize the need, if we are to make a reality of this vision, to continue to devise and implement public policies which ensure that the gains from economic growth and development are equitably distributed throughout society. This challenge of good governance demands an institutional infrastructure that promotes transparency and accountability in public administration, ensures the effective management of fiscal and monetary policies and protects the integrity of judicial and law enforcement systems. A crucial component of our economic and social transformation is the development of our human resources. Jamaica supports the view that sustainable development cannot be achieved without sustained human development. Indeed, the pivotal importance of our human resources to the development process was reaffirmed by the Caribbean Community member States in the Montego Bay Declaration adopted in 1997. We in the Caribbean region stand firmly committed to, first, nurturingthe development of each person’s potential without regard to gender; secondly, developing a culture of entrepreneurship; thirdly, research and development as a way of life and a means of improving production; and finally, improving the competitiveness of those industries on which our economies are based. We look to the international community to support these aspirations. In this regard, Jamaica welcomes the Secretary- General’s proposed initiatives to strengthen the international framework for human development. We agree that it would be useful to convene global and regional seminars exploring ways to advance human resource development and institution-building in preparation for the Millennium Assembly to be held in the year 2000. The issue of sustainable development for small island developing States is of particular importance to Jamaica. It speaks to the very survival of a group of island States whose economic viability and developmental aspirations are inextricably linked to the carrying capacity of the fragile ecosystems in which these nations make their home. I speak of the ecologically vulnerable islands and low-lying coastal States of the Caribbean, which are continually subject to the pressures of urbanization and resource exploitation, to the pollution of their coastal waters and to the threat of natural disasters. We are endangered by the threat of sea-level rise and face the destruction of our coral reefs. The danger posed by natural disasters was most recently demonstrated by hurricane Georges, which wreaked destruction through the Caribbean, causing widespread loss of life and property in Antigua and Barbuda, Cuba, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Saint Kitts and Nevis. We take this opportunity to appeal to the international community to provide urgent and generous humanitarian assistance and support for the reconstruction of our sister Caribbean States. Jamaica welcomes the ongoing effort of the United Nations to develop economic and ecological vulnerability indices for small island developing States and will be monitoring closely the outcome of this work. The success of the small island developing States initiative will depend on the negotiation of favourable agreements among national stakeholders and on the forging of effective partnerships with donor countries. Jamaica therefore looks forward to the convening of the special session for the review of the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States in 1999, which provides an opportunity for real progress to be made through the commitment of financial resources. What we need now is an action- oriented follow-up programme to take our economies into the twenty-first century. Jamaica is a strong advocate of multilateralism and believes that measures available within the multilateral framework should be employed to assist developing countries to benefit meaningfully from the process of globalization. We note that while this process holds much promise for growth and prosperity, it also poses serious challenges for developing countries, many of which are being increasingly marginalized. The reality is that the globalization process is heightening patterns of uneven development among developed and developing countries, and it is already very clear that there is no globalization of benefits. 5 The plight of developing countries in the wake of the financial crisis currently affecting the global economy is made even grimmer when we take into account the decline in concessionary financial flows from the donor community which we have witnessed in recent years. Official development assistance represents today only an average of 0.22 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries, a far cry from the target of 0.7 per cent set in 1972. The share of official development assistance in net resource flows to developing countries fell from 64 per cent in 1994 to 22 per cent in 1996. Taken with the heavy burden of the debt-service payments which must be met, we are faced with the unhappy circumstance of net reverse flows from the South to the North at a time when additional resources are needed to address the challenges which attend the globalization process. These trends must be reversed if developing countries are to have a fair opportunity to achieve meaningful development; for the success of the development process is dependent on the availability of external financing, and concessionary resource flows play a significant role in the maintenance of economic stability, the development of infrastructure and capacity-building, which are prerequisites for effective participation in the globalization process. Jamaica considers that the time has come for us to address these issues in serious dialogue. There is an urgent need to identify ways in which development financing from industrialized to developing and transition economies for both public and private sector enterprise may be increased. We must explore measures to relieve the external debt of the developing countries, including the cancellation of debt. We should seek to have dialogues between creditor and debtor countries to ensure an increase in the flow of concessionary financing in support of economic reforms, poverty eradication and the achievement of sustainable development. We therefore join the call for the urgent convening of a conference on financing for development at an early date. Crucial issues which we would wish to see discussed at such a meeting are strategies for mobilizing domestic resources for development; mobilization of international private financial flows; international financial cooperation for development; debt relief; and trade facilitation for development. Beyond this proposed conference, my Government recognizes that there is a need for ongoing exchange between the North and the South. While the days of the ideological divide and political polarization are behind us, we are still faced with the challenge of North-South disparity in development and opportunity. We need to foster increased collaboration between the developed and the developing world to identify ways in which wider cooperation on issues concerning trade and investment, debt and development may be pursued. We consider that a process of dialogue on these issues could be initiated by a representative group of developing and transition economies in consultation with the major industrialized countries. We believe that such a process of dialogue would pave the way for a broader framework of functional cooperation in areas of interest to both North and South. It is with much satisfaction that Jamaica assumes the chairmanship of the Group of 15 developing States, and we look forward to hosting the ninth ministerial meeting in Jamaica in February next year. Jamaica, during its tenure, will seek to ensure that developing countries play a more active role in shaping the international economy so as to promote greater balance and equity. My Government remains deeply concerned at the ever expanding illicit drug trade, which is not only a menace to civil society, but also undermines the economic viability of our countries. The extraordinary demand for and supply of illicit drugs for this lucrative trade has resulted in the formation of transnational networks, including highly sophisticated money-laundering operations. Of even greater concern is the now well- established link between the drug trade and the proliferation of small arms. The ready availability of small arms has intensified the cycle of crime and violence in our societies. The special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem, held earlier this year, underscored the need to strengthen the process of bilateral, regional and international cooperation in the fight against illicit drug activities. These initiatives should also deal simultaneously with the related problem of small arms. Jamaica calls on the international community to fully support these efforts. Jamaica joins in condemning the acts of terrorism committed in Dar-es-Salaam and Nairobi during August. We support the adoption of a multilateral approach as the most effective means of removing this threat to the security of the international community. 6 Caribbean States recognize the ocean as a symbol of the common heritage of mankind, a vital resource which should be managed in a responsible manner so as to ensure its continued use for present and future generations. Caribbean Governments are committed to the protection of the Caribbean Sea, our shared patrimony. We have recently taken a decision to develop and implement a comprehensive coastal zone management programme by the year 2000. We continue to be concerned at the threat tothe fragile marine environment posed by the regular shipment of nuclear and other hazardous waste through the Caribbean Sea. Jamaica commends the Government of Portugal for its initiative in establishing the Independent World Commission on the Oceans, on which an eminent Jamaican serves. As part of its recognition of the International Year of the Ocean, the Government of Jamaica has established a National Council on Ocean and Coastal Zone Management to promote the sustainable development and use of our marine resources. The International Seabed Authority, which has its headquarters in Kingston, continues to make progress on the negotiation of a mining code. It is hoped that these negotiations will be finalized at an early date, so that a regulatory regime for the resources of the seabed may be firmly established. We call on Member States to participate more actively in these negotiations in order to ensure that the code which is developed will protect the interests of all countries. We also urge Member States to support the operation of the Authority through the commitment of resources. It has not escaped our attention that many of the preceding speakers have made reference to the need for the promotion of international peace, human security and sustainable development. As we move forward towards the end of an era, we must redouble our efforts to ensure that we do not face the dawn of the new millennium burdened by the weight of unresolved issues which impede the development of our community of nations and which undermine the well-being of our peoples. Clearly, it is in our individual and collective interest to participate fully in the process for development and peace, for, after all, the character of the global village of the future will ultimately be determined by the quality of the input that each of us invests today.  I should like first of all to extend to Mr. Didier Opertti the Ethiopian delegation’s congratulations on his well-deserved unanimous election to preside over the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. We are fully confident that under his guidance the work of this session of the General Assembly will meet with resounding success. I should like also to express our appreciation to the outgoing President for the most effective guidance he provided to the fifty-second session of the General Assembly and for the most valuable contribution he has made in this regard. We are indeed deeply indebted to our Secretary- General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who has tried to inject new vitality into the United Nations and who has, under difficult circumstances, continued to make a difference at the helm of the Organization. We appreciate very deeply in particular what the Secretary-General has been doing to ensure that the voices of all those whose viewpoints needed to be heard are heard, and that there is a more effective cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU). I wish in this regard to commend him with great satisfaction for what can only be called the historic report he has submitted on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa. This report, on which the Secretary-General has deservedly already been congratulated by many, raises all those issues which are vital for the future of Africa and treats them with such frankness and transparency that I can only hope that we will all have the necessary resolve and commitment to follow up its recommendations and ensure their implementation. We in Africa have made, over the past few years, tremendous efforts to change Africa’s image and reality. Despite the apparent slips of the past few months, what 9 has been achieved on our continent since the early 1990s should not be underestimated. This applies both to activities in the economic area as well as to the work for peace and stability on our continent. The past few years have demonstrated quite vividly how most African countries, including my own, Ethiopia, have shown the necessary determination to create a domestic climate conducive to economic growth and development. There is today hardly any country in Africa which has not acknowledged that the economic future of countries lies in market-based and private-sector-driven economic transformation and which has not taken the appropriate steps to that end. It is indeed gratifying to note that the results, certainly in my own country, have been encouraging. However, it is hardly disputable that our performance in the economic area has not by any means measured up to our expectations and that it has been far below what is needed to prevent hopelessness and despair on our continent, especially among the younger generation. Although the reasons that provide part of the explanation for this may not be wanting, it is nonetheless very obvious that the well-known limitations we face in international economic cooperation, in particular in the area of trade and in connection with the debt burden, constitute the major impediments to Africa’s economic regeneration. Consequently, the Secretary-General has reiterated in his report that there is indeed an urgent need for political will to ensure sustainable growth and development in Africa, not only on our part as Africans but also on the part of the international community as a whole. In the past few years we in Africa have also made every effort, in particular through subregional organizations, to work for peace and to prevent and contain conflicts. In this regard, the establishment by the OAU of a Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution in Africa has been a major step we have taken, and our achievement on this score over the past few years should not be underestimated. In our own subregion, we have continued to exert the necessary efforts for peace in the Sudan and to assist the people of Somalia in achieving national reconciliation and establish a broad-based Government and a central authority. In both cases, while success has not been easily won, the efforts we are making have nonetheless continued because of the conviction, including on the part of our partners in the international community, that there is no effective alternative to these efforts carried out at the subregional level through the mechanism of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). But it is very clear that the gains, however small, made over the past few years in the area of peace and security in Africa have been tested very severely in the past few months. Developments in the Great Lakes region, most particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, represent some of the serious sources of concern we have in this regard. Nevertheless, we remain hopeful that a way out of this looming danger in the Great Lakes region will be found based on full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries of the region, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and on the full recognition of the security concerns of all countries of the region. It is Ethiopia’s firm conviction that there is no alternative as a guarantee for peace and amity among States to the scrupulous observance of all of the principles of international law governing inter-State relations. However, the greatest danger for peace in this connection is not so much the violation of international law per se, but the response by the international community in the face of such violation. When the international community, for whatever reason, fails to respond to aggression and to violations of international law with the required indignation and resolve, then aggressors are sent, wittingly or unwittingly, the message that the principles of international law are not there to underpin the peace and that laws are there to be violated with impunity. This has been the lesson that we have drawn from one of the major recent disappointments that we have had in the area of peace and security in Africa. I am, of course, referring here to the naked aggression by the State of Eritrea against Ethiopia on 12 May 1998. Despite the efforts by various parties, this aggression continues to portend the outbreak of a full-scale war between the two countries because, on the one hand, of Eritrea’s intransigence in insisting that the peaceful resolution of the crisis must be linked to Ethiopia’s acceptance of the loss of its sovereignty over a part of its territory and to the consequent appeasement of Eritrea, and, on the other, of the dangerous impression the international community is conveying: that aggression entails not costs to the aggressor, but rewards. The aggression committed by the Eritrean regime against Ethiopia is unprecedented in more ways than one. 10 First, it is aggression that was not only unprovoked but was also carried out against a State that, until the day of the aggression, was a true friend of Eritrea — probably the only true friend Eritrea had until that day of infamy when it decided to stab Ethiopia in the back. Secondly, this is an aggression that, paradoxical as it may seem, was designed to impose Eritrea’s will and policy on a country that is in no shape or form suited to play second fiddle to Eritrea. It is quite possible that Ethiopia’s preoccupation with development and with the fight against poverty over the past several years might have created the wrong impression in the minds of Eritrea’s leaders, with their fixation on muscle-flexing and military might. Conscious of its responsibility not only for its own people but also for peace and the image of our subregion, Ethiopia has exerted and continues to exert the maximum possible effort to ensure the peaceful resolution of this crisis, which was created solely by the Eritrean aggression against Ethiopia and the subsequent occupation of Ethiopian territory. Our full cooperation with the various efforts made in this regard — ranging from the United States-Rwandan facilitation to the ongoing effort by the Organization of African Unity — attests to the maximum amount of self- restraint that Ethiopia has demonstrated under difficult circumstances and in the complete absence of a rational and reasonable partner for peace on the part of Eritrea since the early days of the aggression. The origin of the crisis between Ethiopia and Eritrea is not in any bilateral dispute between the two countries; rather it is the result of aggression — an unprovoked aggression which constitutes a flagrant violation of international law. To many this Eritrean aggression against Ethiopia has been incomprehensible. But to those who, like us, are familiar with the internal Eritrean situation, the behaviour of the Eritrean Government stems directly from the total absence in Eritrea of the normal characteristics of a State. The absolute failure of institutions, the absence of the rule of law and the lack of accountability can explain the aggressive behaviour of the Eritrean leadership towards its neighbours ever since the establishment of Eritrea as an independent State. As a result, these factors also constitute the single most important cause for the current crisis between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The fact that aggression was committed against Ethiopia by Eritrea has been indisputable for some time now. This has been the position and conclusion of all those who have so far tried, under the difficult circumstances posed by Eritrea’s obduracy and lack of civility, to make their good offices available as facilitators and as brokers of peace in this conflict. No one who has been intimately involved with these various efforts for peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea would fail to see that Eritrea has never, ever been prepared to give peace a chance. No one who has been close to the efforts made so far to resolve the crisis peacefully would fail to have noted not only the absolute disregard for peace on the part of the Eritrean authorities, but also their attempt to conceal the truth, their lack of transparency and their sheer failure to demonstrate the minimum decency towards all those who have tried to help. Nevertheless, it is indeed regrettable that some, jettisoning their principles, seem to have drawn the conclusion that, in the face of the known irrationality bordering on the insane in Eritrea, what needs to be done is to lean on Ethiopia, the victim of the aggression, to compromise on principles and to agree to the appeasement of the aggressor and to reward aggression. Two things must not be overlooked by the international community with regard to the enormous implications of Eritrea’s aggression against Ethiopia for international law and for the future of peace and stability in our subregion. First, it must be recognized that this is precisely a trap laid by the Eritrean authorities in the form of a deliberately designed game of chicken, calculated, these authorities hope, to end with rewarding aggression. Needless to say, Ethiopia refuses to play according to the Eritrean script, and we call upon the international community to take the same resolute stand. Secondly, it should never be assumed that through appeasement war would be averted and that durable peace can be ensured in our part of the world. Although because of its recent history this part of the world admittedly needs peace most, it cannot be expected to pay any price to avoid war, in particular by accommodating aggressors. Clearly it stands to reason, and history has amply demonstrated, that war in the long run cannot be averted by appeasing aggressors. It is a total illusion to believe that Eritrea will be tamed, and we are saying this from experience. One just has to look at Eritrea’s track record of the past few years in our area. Eritrea’s propensity to aggression manifested itself first in its belligerent attitude towards its neighbours over the past seven years and has culminated in its most extreme form of aggression against Ethiopia. In the face of such a destructive attitude one may ask why such belligerence by Eritrea was tolerated for so long. The answer is that, since we believed that the transition from leading a liberation movement to running an independent State would take time, we somehow entertained the hope 11 that the Eritrean leadership would mature over time, as is the case in almost all other similar circumstances. But our hopes were finally dashed on 12 May 1998. In light of this, we have absolutely no doubt that, if we fail to tell the Eritrean authorities in no uncertain terms that their unruly behaviour cannot be tolerated any longer, the result will be even greater instability and interminable conflict in the subregion, and it will have enormous implications for peace and stability in our continent. That is why the Ethiopian Government and people firmly believe that this flagrant violation of international law by a small nation that is totally blinded by arrogance and led astray by a leadership that has concluded that brinkmanship will always pay should not be left unchallenged. On our part, whether the international community stands with us or not on the fundamental principle of preserving international law and resisting aggression, regardless of the consequences, we are prepared to stand alone, if need be on principle as well as for our national dignity. This, as we all remember, would not be the first time for Ethiopia to be in such a situation. In this connection, one is reminded of Emperor Haile Selassie and the League of Nations following Italian aggression against Ethiopia in 1936. The measure proposed at the time against Italy was the imposition of an oil embargo, which certainly would have been effective in crippling Italian aggression against Ethiopia. Nevertheless, since appeasing Fascist Italy was the preferred option for the great Powers of the time, the proposal was rejected. Instead, in a clear demonstration of injustice unprecedented in the history of inter-State conflicts, an arms embargo was imposed by the League on both the aggressor, Italy, and the victim of aggression, Ethiopia. As a result we all know, as history has recorded, this dismal failure of the League of Nations to prevent aggression was one of the causes which brought about the demise of the organization and later contributed to the outbreak of the Second World War. It is Ethiopia’s hope that this shameful episode will not be repeated by the international community today, although the nature and scale of the challenge Ethiopia is facing today is radically different, and is not comparable to what it faced during those difficult days on the eve of the Second World War. The United Nations is still grappling with various issues affecting international peace and security around the world. Among these, the situation in Angola is a cause for serious concern to us. The behaviour of UNITA clearly constitutes a dangerous trend which might lead to the derailment of the peace process — namely, the full implementation of the Lusaka Protocol. We urge the United Nations to exert the maximum effort to save the fragile situation in Angola and ensure the establishment of lasting peace and stability in that country. On the situation in the Middle East, we hope every effort will be exerted towards the full implementation of the Oslo accords, with a view to establishing durable peace in the area. With regard to the question of Western Sahara, it is our earnest hope that the proposed referendum on the future of the territory will be held as soon as possible to bring about a final and successful settlement of the issue. As a founding member of this Organization, Ethiopia has always been prepared to contribute to the best of its ability to all efforts designed to make the United Nations and its various organs more effective and more representative. Accordingly, my country attaches great importance to the ongoing exercises aimed, among other things, at reforming and restructuring the Security Council. A satisfactory, fruitful and expeditious outcome of this process is indeed vital for the effectiveness, credibility and, I might add, the enhanced legitimacy of the world body. For Ethiopia, and for all those who have trust in the efficacy of multilateralism, there is no alternative to the United Nations. The Organization should therefore be protected, and what it stands for — whether in the areas of economic cooperation, disarmament or human rights — should be promoted and fostered with all dedication and commitment. In this endeavour, Ethiopia will continue to be second to none in discharging its responsibilities to the United Nations in this and other activities of the Organization. I therefore wish to conclude by renewing Ethiopia’s commitment to the United Nations and to what it stands for. Mr. President, as I address the Assembly for the first time as President of Colombia, I should like to offer you, on behalf of my Government, our warmest congratulations on being elected to guide our debates during this session. A few weeks ago, the most important democratic elections in Colombia’s recent history took place. Despite the problems that have besieged our nation in the last few years, our institutional structure has faced one of the sternest tests ever and has again shown that it is solid. In June, more than 12 million people — one of the highest electoral turnouts in the history of the Republic — expressed their free, spontaneous and conscious choice. Today, Colombia is looking towards new horizons. We have restored confidence in our country. We have started the changes which will enable us to face our internal problems with determination and which will win us a more positive and dynamic place in the international community. Our most urgent task will be to build for peace. That is the unshakable commitment of my Government and the heartfelt desire of all of the Colombian people. We are aware that any process designed to root out the causes of conflict for all time will be highly complex. But all our efforts will be dedicated to this noble goal, and we will strive for it tirelessly. It is for this reason that I have personally taken the lead in building peace. We are working hard on the preparation of an agenda for this purpose. We are convinced that representatives of all sectors of society should play a part, and that at the end of the road we will find a guiding light that will lead our country again to peaceful coexistence. Peace in Colombia will also be founded on a clear strategy for economic development and a bold policy for social justice. Only in this way will it be possible to forge a fruitful and lasting peace. As we travel the road to peace the support of the international community will complement our own efforts. We will advocate respect for fundamental rights and full application of international humanitarian law among all those involved in conflict. We will learn from the valuable experiences of other countries in the solution of internal conflicts, and we will adopt whatever is applicable and appropriate to our own situation. Peace in Colombia will demand very substantial investments in social sectors and infrastructure in the zones of conflict. For this, we will create a “Peace Fund”. A significant portion of the money required will come from internal sources. We will also be looking for contributions from the international community, from which we have already received expressions of encouragement, solidarity and interest. All these actions will be part of what we have termed “diplomacy for peace”. It will be diplomacy with social and economic content. It will be diplomacy expressed in investment and in the mobilization of human, technical and financial resources, so that our peace will have a firm and lasting foundation. The achievement of peace in Colombia will be an important initial contribution to the liberation of mankind from one of the twentieth century’s greatest evils: the global problem of illicit drugs. To the extent that we can find agricultural alternatives for our peasant farmers, with fair prices for their products at home and abroad, they will become less dependent on illicit crops. The support of the international community will be crucial in this. The eradication of illicit crops will be one of the central elements of the peace talks that we intend to undertake with the groups engaged in armed conflict. It is true that the end of East-West confrontation brought into being a system of international relations based on détente and on a decline in the role that military power had played during the cold war. The spectre of a nuclear cataclysm seemed to have vanished, and all humanity embraced new hopes for the future. It was thought that the end of the cold war would be the salvation of the many countries and the millions of people who had been forgotten in the midst of tensions and feuds between the two superpowers. But now, almost 10 years later, those initial expectations are far from becoming a reality. Ethnic and religious rivalries, regional confrontations and grave new threats to peace have emerged. I must say most clearly that my Government and the people of Colombia absolutely reject all kinds and modes of terrorism, whatever their origin or motive. There can be no truce with terrorism. All States must fight together to defeat it. This is surely one of our greatest challenges. Corruption is buffeting democracy in a growing number of countries and is becoming a cause of political and social breakdown. Illicit drugs continue to be one of the worst scourges of today’s society, bringing irreparable harm to the new generations and, therefore, to the future of humanity. Human rights are still not properly respected. Women are still the target of abuse and discrimination. Children are the victims of disgraceful practices. Fifty years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the more vulnerable groups often have no access to the protection that States are obliged to provide for them. Unsustainable consumer and production practices still continue. The planet’s natural resources are being depleted, its biological wealth is being looted, and our rivers and oceans are being contaminated. Poverty continues to affect huge segments of society. Economic growth in some countries and the prosperity of some levels of society contrast dramatically with the marginalization suffered by the majority of the world’s population. This situation is occurring in an international environment in which the right to development is 2 indissolubly linked to the existence of a favourable international climate. We are going through the most serious financial crisis since the end of the cold war, but there does not yet seem to be sufficient clarity and political will to face it and overcome it. All Latin America has voiced its concern at the gravity of the crisis. Its origins are outside our region, in which countries have made structural reforms to achieve healthy economies that will enable them to meet the social expectations of their peoples. We are aware of the risk of a world recession, and we consider it essential that the more developed countries, the Group of Seven and the international financial organs adopt suitable measures to prevent any new collapse. Such a disaster would irreversibly affect the developing countries first. The measures should enable the financial markets to recover their stability and provide a rapid solution to the current crisis in the world economy that has caused so much concern. Among the proposals which Colombia made at the San Francisco Conference and which were included in the United Nations Charter, there are two I would now like to mention, because they belong to the common heritage of our foreign policy: first, compliance in good faith with the obligations assumed by the Member States of the United Nations, as an underlying assumption for the validity of its universal action; and secondly, recognition of the role played by regional arrangements and agencies in the maintenance of peace, in international security as an integrated concept and in the peaceful settlement of disputes between States. Colombia believes that universalism and regionalism are complementary and should support each other harmoniously. Therefore, one of the aims of our diplomacy is to strengthen the regional agencies within the concept of universalism. It is thus essential that we join our efforts to regain the momentum achieved on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the United Nations, so that the Organization will be revitalized and ready for the beginning of a new millennium. The various levels of action required are all based on the credibility of the multilateralism which the United Nations embodies and the trust which our peoples have in it. Some support the approval of certain reforms that the experience of this period of history and the changes on the world scene have in themselves made imperative. The United Nations cannot be expected to possess magic formulas that we ourselves do not have for solving problems and situations that concern us all, within the context of the interdependence and internationalization characteristic of our times. But we certainly need to adapt them to this moment in history, when we face such wide horizons and colossal challenges. We need something of the idealism and pragmatic spirit which could be inspired by solidarity among the human race. The reasons for the creation of the United Nations not only remain intact, but also have rapidly even become more relevant in the second half of the twentieth century. The principles which inspired its creation have become so important that any action taken unilaterally or by a group of States turns out to be inadequate or limited in effect. Therefore, it will be useful to identify what we can do to make the proposed reforms truly worthwhile. One must seek a genuine consensus for the agenda of priorities for the new millennium. Colombia is ready to help reconcile existing disputes. This is not a question of a simple, formal agreement or of a quest for utopian reform, but of a meeting of wills and a methodical and open-minded consensus regarding proposals which are designed to bring us closer to an era of greater justice and balance. We must eliminate the contradiction in which more responsibilities, actions and programmes are demanded from the United Nations while at the same time some States fail to meet their obligations or do not show any willingness to increase their contribution in proportion to their capacity. Without doubt, the United Nations must be properly funded. The adaptation of structures, regulations and modes of operation means that the Organization must have the personnel and the funds it needs, through efficient and exemplary management. Cooperation for development must receive a massive injection to save it from decline, and this must be in accordance with the text and spirit of the Charter and of countless commitments, within an overall concept that includes encouragement of respect for human, individual, social, economic and cultural rights. My Government has a policy of encouraging broader participation by the new actors on the international stage, such as non-governmental organizations and the private sector. New sources of funding for certain social, development and humanitarian programmes should be sought, which should extend the scope of action of the 3 United Nations and ensure that it continues to steer the common course of international solidarity. We need multilateralism with social content, in which the human being is the central priority and in which development is the guiding principle in decisions. I stand before you to appeal to all nations to contribute to the burial of the post-cold-war period, to see it as no more than an interregnum, and to open the door wide to an era of creative and more humane multilateralism. The original principles of the Organization are of course still valid, but we need to make some adjustments. We need to reconsider certain modes of international action and heed the voices of the peoples who desire development and fight for it in the midst of difficulty and conflict. We need to strengthen communication and dialogue between North and South and to correct unreasonable imbalances. We believe that the time has come to make an objective review of the present state of negotiations for the reform of the Organization, in order to ensure that social and economic matters are properly related to the legitimate aspirations of developing nations. There must be instruments to encourage rapport between the organs originating from the San Francisco Charter and those institutions born at Bretton Woods. We know that the responses of individual nations or groups of States are insufficient. Therefore, there is an even more urgent need to coordinate global responses through vigorous multilateralism. There is an obvious dichotomy between de facto globalization, science and technology, instantaneous communications and the world market, on the one hand, and, on the hand, the absence of genuine social order and human advancement. We must revive an authentic and productive North- South dialogue, based on a concept of solidarity which is more substantial than declarations or good intentions and which is expressed in specific action. It must take account of the needs of the more vulnerable groups and of those excluded from progress. It must replace the logic of confrontation and of the division between poor and rich countries with the logic of cooperation, shared responsibility and solidarity inspired by justice as the golden rule of multilateralism. His Holiness Pope John Paul II summed up this position perfectly on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, when, addressing this same Assembly, he urged us to unite our efforts to build a civilization of love, founded on the universal values of peace, solidarity, justice and liberty, to overcome the fear which darkens human existence at the end of the twentieth century. We firmly believe that the Charter and all the institutions of the international system must promote dynamic cooperation, each enriching the shared universal heritage with its own particular character. The United Nations must not be merely a forum for the sovereign expression of States. It must be the place for negotiation and synthesis in the political, cultural, social and economic life of the nations. It is reassuring to see that the grand designs that inspired the Charter remain valid. It is now our task to maintain them and to interpret the new situations that arise in the course of history. We know, for example, that conflicts within States are conceptually different from the old wars between States. We have a greater understanding of the link between peace and development and of the way in which politics and socioeconomic interests are related. We believe that it is appropriate to consolidate a minimum international order and to replace violence and terrorism with peace and coexistence, which should then thrive naturally through multilateralism. Colombia encourages the efforts undertaken in arms control, with the systematic quest for disarmament as the ultimate goal, and supports the priority allocation of world and regional resources to development. We believe that it is therefore essential to make progress in the control and gradual elimination of weapons of mass destruction and to exercise effective control over the illegal arms trade, to which thousands of men, women and children fall victim daily throughout the world, and especially in the developing countries. We need a realistic and methodical strategy to secure peace in our time and in the coming century. We need to promote monitoring mechanisms for treaty compliance, the negotiated solution of conflicts and the creation of nuclear-free zones with effective verification systems. In this respect, the United Nations will need to perfect early- warning systems to evaluate events so that its actions will be efficient and genuinely preventive. I have come here today to reaffirm Colombia’s unbroken tradition as a nation devoted to the great 4 principles that underpin the very existence of the United Nations. We are prepared to offer, with thoughtful optimism, our support for the achievement of its purposes and its reforms. We believe it would be useful to review and appraise the results of the various summits held in recent years, so that we may follow up their results and plans of action. This will serve both as a gauge of their effectiveness and as the central element of the analysis of the coordination of the various institutions of the United Nations system as a whole. Our people rightly demand more effective action and less empty rhetoric. We cannot betray billions of human beings who yearn for a world at peace, with democracy and freedom, and above all just, united and equitable.  First of all, I wish to congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session and to express my sincere belief that under his leadership this session of the General Assembly will carry out successfully the tasks that the international community expects this global forum to deal with. I would also like to thank Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for his work and contribution to the successful completion of the last session of the General Assembly. In this period of significant global political and economic changes, the world needs a modern and effective United Nations that is capable of dealing with issues of importance to all of mankind in a proper and flexible manner. Slovakia believes that the ongoing process of reform of the United Nations will contribute substantively to this goal. It gives its full support to the swift implementation of the reform measures initiated by the Secretary-General in his basic report on reform. The Slovak Republic welcomes the proposal to designate the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly as the Millennium Assembly. We expect that the Millennium Assembly will provide Member States an opportunity to formulate answers to questions about the strategic goals of the United Nations for the next millennium in the field of international peace and security and economic cooperation. We assume that the report on the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century that the Secretary-General intends to present to the General Assembly in the year 2000 will provide a thorough evaluation of the results achieved in specific areas of United Nations activities. The Slovak Republic supports a Security Council reform that would enhance its representative character, its working methods and the transparency of its work, as well as preserve the Council?s capability to act promptly. The reform should result in an adequate representation of individual regional groups and accommodate a legitimate claim of the Eastern European regional Group and other States to a new non-permanent seat in the Security Council. Let us keep in mind that the number of members of the Eastern European Group has doubled over the past few years. 22 Slovakia supports the efforts to reach a consensus on the reform in the area of United Nations financing, favouring the principle of capacity to pay. In any case, much of the tension can be solved through the regular contributions by Member States to the relevant United Nations budgets. The Slovak Republic supports the idea of the exclusively peaceful use of nuclear energy and is a strong advocate of unconditional and universal observance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). Slovakia actively participates in the Preparatory Committee for the 2000 sixth Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT, and in this context fully supports the universality of the NPT and the CTBT. In March of this year, Slovakia completed the ratification process of the CTBT. This confirms our active approach in this area. We appreciate the highly qualified and objective expertise of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), both in the field of elimination of the nuclear military threat and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Slovakia fully supported the activities of the International Atomic Energy Agency known as programme “93+2” for strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system. I have the honour to inform the Assembly that the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency approved at its session in September the additional protocol to the safeguards agreement between Slovakia and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Early entry into force of the additional protocol will be a high priority for Slovak authorities. Slovakia pays very close attention to the issue of landmines. The ratification of the Ottawa Convention is in the internal legislative process. We believe that the Ottawa process and the Conference on Disarmament are complementary. Slovakia — which has experience in demining devices and technologies, and has capacities in education and training in mine clearance — would like to play an active role in the process of the total elimination of anti-personnel landmines. In the area of biological weapons, the Slovak Republic supports improving the verification system of the Biological Weapons Convention, as well as the elimination of the illegal transfer of these weapons. Slovakia supports the efforts of the United Nations aimed at conflict resolution through the strengthening of United Nations capacities in the field of preventive diplomacy, early warning systems and effective use of United Nations peacekeeping operations. Slovakia?s active participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations is proof of our continuing commitment. At present, Slovakia is participating in three peacekeeping operations, and it is prepared to provide troops to other missions as well. My country supports the United Nations efforts to strengthen its capacity for rapid deployment of United Nations peacekeeping forces, especially in further developing the concept of United Nations stand-by arrangements, as well as a rapidly deployable mission headquarters. In the process of post-conflict peace-building, it is of the utmost importance that a multifunctional approach in close coordination with regional institutions and non- governmental and humanitarian organizations should be strictly observed. One of the global problems that poses an ever increasing threat to humankind is terrorism. Slovakia has always rejected terrorism and strongly condemns all acts, methods and practices of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable, wherever and by whomsoever committed. The joint efforts of all States are a vital precondition for successful fight against this evil. The year 1998 will witness two important human rights anniversaries — the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the fifth anniversary of the World Conference on Human Rights. Both these events represent an appropriate framework and provide the impetus for the further promotion, protection and development of human rights at the threshold of the twenty-first century. In a year which will mark two important anniversaries in the field of human rights, the Government of the Slovak Republic approved the country?s accession to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which I had the honour to sign on 22 September last. The Slovak Republic attaches great importance to international economic cooperation and to the important role of the Economic and Social Council in this process. In the framework of regional cooperation, Slovakia favours respect for the specific needs of individual regions. We welcome, therefore, the activities of the 23 Economic Commission for Europe aimed at broadening cooperation with the private business sector and non- governmental organizations. Slovakia is interested in a more intensive participation in the development programmes of the United Nations specialized institutions and is preparing its own concept of development assistance, whose objective is to increase Slovakia?s participation in programmes for developing countries. The Slovak Republic, as a member of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Governing Council and the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development, takes an active approach to issues of environmental protection and sustainable development. In accordance with General Assembly resolution 52/201, the Government of the Slovak Republic offered to host the fourth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Bratislava this year. In total 169 parties to the Convention took part in the Conference under the presidency of the Minister of the Environment of the Slovak Republic. The successful outcome of the Conference reaffirmed the commitment of all parties to conserve biological diversity for future generations. The fact that the Government of the Slovak Republic hosted that Conference confirms the importance we attach to the protection of environment and sustainable development. As an emerging donor country, Slovakia is investigating ways of providing humanitarian assistance on a bilateral basis. A very important element in the process of humanitarian assistance, especially in crisis regions, is ensuring the security of humanitarian personnel, and the Slovak Republic is ready to give its support to all United Nations measures aimed at reinforcing this security. The recent twentieth special session of the General Assembly devoted to countering the world drug problem together was an important milestone in the joint efforts of the international community in the fight against drugs. It is a great achievement that for the first time in history a consensus was reached between producer and consumer countries on the need to eliminate the threat of drugs through parallel and considered action in both priority areas: decreasing the demand for drugs and decreasing the production of drugs. To coordinate drug control activities at the regional level, the Slovak Republic is ready to secure the establishment in Bratislava of a regional United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) office for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. We appreciate that the Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court in Rome was successfully completed, and we believe that in the foreseeable future a permanent criminal court will be established in order to punish the most serious crimes against humanity and, moreover, to prevent them. We believe that progress in the preparation of an international legal document on the elimination of nuclear terrorism will be achieved during this session of the General Assembly. We also expect further substantial progress in the discussion on the jurisdictional immunity of States and State property prepared by the International Law Commission. The United Nations contributes not only to the progressive development of international law and its codification but also — in particular through its main judicial authority, the International Court of Justice — to the peaceful solution of disputes between States in accordance with international law. The Slovak Republic has gained its first experience of ICJ proceedings. It welcomed the Court?s Judgment in the case concerning the Gabcˇ'kovo-Nagymaros Project, which confirmed the validity of the treaty between Slovakia and Hungary concerning the construction and operation of the project on the Danube. The Slovak Republic is sincerely interested in the implementation of the Judgment, which would be based on an agreement with Hungary reached, if necessary, with the further help of the International Court of Justice. An active and effective participation of Slovakia in the United Nations is one of our foreign policy priorities. To achieve this objective, Slovakia meets all its commitments under the United Nations Charter in full and is consistently intensifying its engagement in all areas of the United Nations system. The candidature of the Slovak Republic for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council for the term 2000-2001 is the logical result of this approach. I should like to stress that my country, which belongs to the group of small and medium-sized States, is prepared to be fully responsible for bearing its fair share of the global responsibility connected with membership in the Security Council. As we approach the third millennium, a considerable part of humankind is still facing poverty, violence, 24 violations of human rights and the effects of war. The millions of people on this planet affected look to the international community, and the United Nations in particular, with great hope. Whether we will succeed in reforming the United Nations together into a strong, politically efficient and financially healthy system that will be able to meet the expectations of current and future generations depends on the will and commitment of all of us.  Omar Aguirre, of Bolivia; Lisa Malone, of Australia; Pablo Gorga, of Uruguay; Luis Escoto, of Spain; Pedro Ruz, of Chile; together with Guatemalans Rolando Palacios and Celso Mart'nez, all of them United Nations personnel stationed in Guatemala to collaborate in the verification of the peace agreements, gave their lives in carrying out their mission, when they died in a tragic air accident, on 17 March 1998, as they were travelling to a remote area to perform their duties. With the Assembly’s permission, I would like to pay a sincere tribute to those who, at a time of peace, generously gave their lives for peace in Guatemala. Equally moved by the destruction left by hurricane Georges in its passage through the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and other Caribbean territories and the southern United States, I wish to express the solidarity of the people and the Government of Guatemala with those who suffered economic losses and the inconsolable pain of the loss of human lives. Guatemala feels honoured to welcome Mr. Opertti to the roster of eminent persons who have had the privileged responsibility of conducting the debates of this forum throughout its existence. His election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session, while showing recognition of his great diplomatic talent, is the natural result of the efforts that he and his country have made in promoting understanding among the peoples and the nations of the world. We are fully convinced that our Organization will benefit from his ample experience as one of the supporters of the principles of the inter-American system. This guarantees that the excellent work of his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, will be continued, and we wish to express our appreciation for the excellent manner in which he conducted the work of the General Assembly during the year of his mandate. This is the second time that Guatemala has addressed the General Assembly since the signature of the peace agreements that put an end to the fratricidal struggle that senselessly tore our nation apart for almost four decades. I must again acknowledge the solidarity the international community showed throughout the process, especially during the difficult and protracted task of implementing the accords, which will lead us to the reconstruction of our society and the fulfilment of our highest aspirations for economic development, equity and justice. The United Nations and the Government and the people of Guatemala have worked together in the implementation of the peace agreements. Under the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA) we have gone forward with firm and sure steps in complying with the accords, and it is with great satisfaction that I can report to the Assembly that the timetable of the accords is being met with sure progress. That is why we welcome the recent report of the Secretary-General on the status of verification of the peace agreements in Guatemala (A/53/288), and we strongly support his recommendation that the General Assembly authorize the renewal of MINUGUA’s mandate until 31 December 1999. As a Member of an Organization whose main objective is to preserve peace among nations, our own 15 experience of living in peace leads us to reaffirm our belief in multilateralism as a genuine form of pooling efforts for coexistence among the peoples of the world. To the ordinary citizen of Guatemala, regional organizations, sister nations and international commitments are no longer regarded as abstractions, instead becoming elements of our reality which, added to our political and cultural experience, is producing a new synthesis of the local with the global. That new synthesis in Guatemala means peace, which is rooted in the happy conjunction of the ancestral pacifism of our own ancient cultures with the universally accepted ethical values promoted in the various centres of multilateral convergence, both regionally and globally. These positive results have also been factors in accelerating our involvement in regional cooperation initiatives, especially in the process of Central American integration, in which Guatemala, determined to achieve it, has made significant efforts, motivated by the view shared by the other actors in the process that a united Central America will be much more capable of facing the challenges of globalization for the benefit of our peoples. Believing also that the centres of multilateral administration are fundamental to promoting peace and development, we have been motivated to participate actively in the tasks of consolidating the work of the Association of Caribbean States, an organization of 25 member States sharing the Caribbean Sea as their common heritage and having the most varied cultural and linguistic traditions. This Association has decided to unite in order to explore the regional potential for promoting conditions that will improve the living standards of their citizens. We do not have time to continue listing the various regional integration initiatives. However, they exemplify the importance that Guatemala attaches to multilateral bodies in efforts to coexist under conditions of justice and equality and in an environment which is increasingly interactive and interdependent. The global condition of the contemporary world is no longer expressed recurrently through periodic events, but is rather a daily constant that, every minute, concerns all individuals on the planet. It poses challenges that may be regarded as either opportunities or threats and that elicit a full spectrum of responses, from naive enthusiasm to irrational fundamentalist resistance. That is why multilateral administration requires renewed, flexible and participatory institutions that respond to the dynamic conditions derived from the development of international relations in the post-cold-war era. Thus, Guatemala has followed with interest modernization efforts within this Organization. We have enthusiastically assumed the responsibility of contributing to the implementation of administrative reforms through a pilot project. We are pleased at the progress that has been made in this area, and we would like to express once again our appreciation for the support we have received from the agencies of the United Nations system, which, under the coordination of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), are helping us with the process of peace and development and making system-wide reform a reality in our country. The work undertaken by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in response to the concerns of Member States regarding the modernization of our Organization deserves our very special recognition. Last July, the Secretary- General honoured us with a visit to Guatemala, and we saw for ourselves the determination and commitment he demands of himself in order to strengthen our Organization and the clear vision of the future that guides his efforts towards the new millennium. Guatemala agrees with other Members on the need to continue the deliberations on the reform of the Security Council. We have studied with interest the various proposals that have been presented, and we hope that despite the differences in their current positions, Member States will be able to reach the necessary level of agreement and understanding in order to bring about a reform that is equitable for all regions and that demonstrates the democratic will that should prevail in the Organization. I must emphasize the important role that the United Nations must play in the creation, codification and application of the norms of international law. A greater involvement by the Organization in this matter would promote greater creativity on the part of Member States in confronting shared problems and would eliminate legal ambiguities that could enable national legislatures to dictate international laws which would then be imposed on less developed countries. We call upon the community of nations to redouble its efforts in this area. At the threshold of the new millennium, and in response to an international society that is increasingly interdependent, we call for a more equitable and just order in the sphere of trade, with clear rules and equal opportunities for all regions and States. This is the only way to promote development in areas where there is an 16 imperative need to eliminate poverty and build more just societies. As the President of Colombia expressed very well in this Assembly, development should take into account the human side of our societies. We must keep striving to accomplish more internal equity in the distribution of resources and burdens. But it is increasingly difficult, under present conditions, to comply with the demands of the international institutions that finance development, without sacrificing the lives of our people, who are already, for the most part, mired in poverty. We are also greatly alarmed to see an insecure and uncertain worldwide economic situation in which dubious speculative practices continue to wreak havoc in the absence of effective controls by those responsible. The world is filling up with products that populations and countries no longer have the means to acquire, and there is no longer any place for our small economies. Now that the Central American countries are making efforts on various fronts to accomplish our integration and liberalize our economies, and as we strive to leave years of armed confrontation behind us and adapt to the demands of the world market, our products must have fair, non- discriminatory access to world markets, and our potential as a competitive destination for productive investment must be recognized. One of the most important subjects on the agenda of the General Assembly is that of disarmament. Guatemala, together with the other Central American countries, condemns any type of nuclear testing. We expressed our concern over the recent tests carried out in other continents. Such activities do not contribute to the peace or the nuclear disarmament that most of the Member States of this Organization desire. Guatemala was also among the first countries to sign the Ottawa Convention prohibiting the manufacture and use of anti-personnel mines. We ask those countries that have not yet done so to become parties to this Convention. We also note with great satisfaction that the concerns of Member States relating to the subject of weapons are growing in scope to include the proliferation, illegal traffic and abuse of small arms. Guatemala is extremely interested in the quest for a solution to this problem, and we believe that the Oslo platform can generate satisfactory responses. We are extremely concerned to see that although to a large extent it has been possible to overcome internal conflicts in most Member States, the international community continues to be shocked by such horrendous acts of international terrorism as those that recently caused much bloodshed in Africa and Northern Ireland. In addition to condemning and unanimously rejecting these vile and cowardly actions that primarily affect innocent human beings who have nothing to do with the causes that are invoked, the international community must observe the resolution of the Rome Conference on the Statute of the International Criminal Court to the effect that “terrorist acts, by whomever and wherever perpetrated and whatever their forms, methods or motives, are serious crimes of concern to the international community”. (A/Conf.183/10, annex I, section E, second paragraph) As is well known, Guatemala was one of the last staging grounds of the cold war, where transnational networks operated with impunity in support of the dirty war taking place inside and outside of the country. We wish to express once again our firm and emphatic political resolve that never again will our territory be used to prepare any type of aggression against any other country. As the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights draws near, Guatemala reaffirms its resolute commitment to honouring the principles contained in the Declaration. One of the most important tasks of the Government of President Alvaro Arzú has been to promote fulfilment of and respect for human rights in all aspects of life in our country. The human rights dimension has been integrated into all spheres of civic life, and, although we still have much to do in that area, we have certainly made great progress, promoting the full blossoming of our rich ethnic, multicultural and multilingual diversity. The United Nations, founded in 1945 on the ideal of keeping peace in the world and with the fundamental role of ensuring that all nations can coexist on the basis of mutual respect among States, is the highest expression of representation by all peoples. However, 53 years after the birth of the United Nations, there are still territories whose citizens are not represented here. My country is aware of the divisions that persist between brothers in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. We hope that their differences can be resolved through dialogue and in a peaceful manner, so that, without any form of rejection or 17 discrimination, all the peoples of the world may be represented in the United Nations. I wish to mention in particular the situation of the 22 million citizens of the Republic of China on Taiwan, as well as the importance and soundness of their economy amid so much financial uncertainty in that region. Our Organization must face great challenges as the new century draws near. We hope that, with the goodwill of all Member States, we can resolutely embark on it so as to ensure the survival of the human race, as well as lives lived in peace, the protection of our environment, economic growth and sustainable development. Only in that way will we achieve the dream of those who, full of ideals, founded the United Nations in San Francisco in 1945.  I come with the greetings and warm wishes of His Majesty King Mswati III, Her Majesty the Indlovukazi, the Queen Mother, the Government and the whole Swazi nation to all our fellow members of the United Nations. On behalf of the Kingdom of Swaziland, I would like to extend our warmest congratulations to Mr. Opertti on his unanimous election to the presidency of the fifty- 9 third session of the General Assembly. We have the fullest confidence in his ability to lead the deliberations of this session, and I can assure him of my delegation?s full support and cooperation. I would like to congratulate his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, on the skill with which he presided over the fifty-second session. I would also like to commend the work done over the past 12 months by our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and the staff of the United Nations Secretariat. We have been impressed by the strength of their commitment to meet the many challenges facing our Organization, and we take pride in their considerable achievements. The Kingdom of Swaziland is encouraged by the progress that has been achieved in the reform of the United Nations. Much credit is due to the Secretary-General and his staff for their implementation of cost-cutting measures and the commitment they have shown to creating a more efficient Organization. For our part, we believe the membership must provide the financial resources for the Organization to carry out the tasks that we ourselves have set. We surely cannot expect the United Nations to meet its existing obligations, let alone take on the new challenges we present to it, if we lag behind in the payment of our dues. The Kingdom of Swaziland makes every effort to keep up to date with its financial obligations in full, on time and without conditions — and we appeal to all our fellow Member States to do the same. The Kingdom of Swaziland is nevertheless concerned at the painfully slow rate of progress in the debate on the restructuring of the Security Council. The delay is especially frustrating when we know that there is global consensus on the need to make the permanent membership of the Council more democratic and representative of the developing world. This issue has been central to discussions during Non-Aligned Movement summit meetings and successive meetings of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). There continues to be unanimous support for change. In this regard, the Kingdom of Swaziland continues to support the African common position, which calls, among other things, for membership of the Security Council to be based on an equitable geographical formula. Africa is calling for two permanent seats, with the full voting and veto rights that are enjoyed by the current membership. However, in the longer term, we believe that the right of veto should be the subject of review, as it is not in accordance with recognized democratic practices since it gives unequal weight to the minority view. As we celebrate the thirtieth year of our independence and the thirtieth birthday of our monarch, the Kingdom of Swaziland is continuing quietly and peacefully to develop all aspects of life according to the wishes and expectations of our people. Our overall aim is to raise the living standards of all our people and to ensure that access to all the basic requirements of decent human life is available to all. We have conducted a number of initiatives aimed at identifying the areas of highest priority for action and we have asked the people themselves to contribute their ideas and views on how we can overcome the challenges we face. We have always believed that sustainable development will be best achieved in our country when there is the involvement, support and understanding of the whole nation. It is for this reason that we continue to consult the people on issues of national importance at open forums, thus giving all Swazis the opportunity to make their views known and have them considered. The implementation of our development aims involves a twin-track approach, with an economic and social reform agenda covering the shorter term, and a national development strategy to provide an action plan for the next 25 years. Both are the result of the recommendations of the Swazi people themselves and reflect the wishes of all Swazis. In a similar vein, and again in response to the people?s request, we are conducting a review of our Constitution. His Majesty informed the General Assembly last year of the establishment of the Constitutional Review Commission. The whole nation is engaged in this vitally important exercise, and I am pleased to inform our fellow Members that substantial progress has been made over the past 12 months. The end result will truly reflect the will of the people themselves, and we are confident that we will have in place a Constitution that will serve the best interests of all Swazis for many generations to come. We have been most grateful for the support we have received from the United Nations towards these important nation-building processes, and we value highly the continued support and encouragement from many of our friends and partners in the international community with respect to our development efforts. 10 In common with almost every country, we find that the issue of unemployment remains our greatest challenge. We recognize that, with the global economic situation deteriorating and the gap between the developed and the developing countries widening, the task of creating jobs is becoming more and more difficult. In response to this, we have introduced incentives to attract investment from both internal and external sources, and we have established an investment promotion authority to act as the catalyst for rapid investment growth. Such national initiatives are aimed at creating favourable conditions for our people to gain a decent standard of living and to continue to enjoy the peace and stability with which we have been blessed throughout our history. We have noted with regret that the past 12 months have seen an alarming rise in situations of internal conflict and external aggression among many of the Member States. Furthermore, there are many instances of situations where internal conflicts have spilled over borders, creating the potential for regional instability. The situations in the Kosovo region of Yugoslavia, and the heightened tension on the border between Iran and Afghanistan, are just two examples which are of great concern to the international community. This worrying trend has resulted in valuable global resources being channelled away from economic and social development priorities, and has undermined our collective efforts to achieve peace and stability throughout the world. All too many of our fellow human beings are caught up in a spiral of seemingly unending violence, with millions forced into exile from their own homes, thus becoming the latest statistics among the unfortunate numbers of refugees. In this respect, we urge the international community to continue to improve its response mechanisms so that appropriate action is taken quickly and decisively to prevent conflict and to repair the misery caused by it. In a similar vein, the stalling of the peace process in the Middle East continues to frustrate the efforts of those who desire a genuine, lasting peace in that troubled region. The Kingdom of Swaziland applauds those nations which are working hard to get the process back on track, and we continue to urge those involved to respect the terms of the Oslo peace accord as the only basis on which to rebuild the atmosphere of trust which is so necessary for the process to move forward. Meanwhile, on our continent of Africa, the conflicts in areas including the Horn of Africa and in countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, Lesotho and Guinea-Bissau, are challenging to the full the diplomatic skills of all of us in the international community who hope to bring lasting peace to our continent. Of particular concern to us in the southern African region has been the renewal of civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the resumption of hostilities in Angola and the very recent disturbances in Lesotho. Our fellow members will recall the efforts of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), among others, to find a solution to the distressing situations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola, which are hampering cooperation between member States of the community. In the case of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the United Nations has a role to play as peacemaker to complement the efforts of SADC and the OAU. In all cases, we pray that a solution may be found to end the bloodshed, establish a lasting ceasefire and allow negotiations between the opposing sides. We pray that sustainable solutions may soon be found to all of Africa?s conflict situations and that all our fellow Africans may be free from the sufferings endured by so many for so long. The Kingdom of Swaziland applauds the remarkable progress made towards a lasting settlement in Northern Ireland. We know there is still a long way to go, but, given the centuries-long history of the Troubles, the achievement has been all the more impressive. We also commend those who have contributed to the process, and we salute especially the people of Northern Ireland, who chose to take their destiny in their own hands and voted for peace. This provides an excellent example of what is possible when there is true commitment to peace from all sides in a dispute. Our continent?s fresh crises have shown once more that Africa needs to be better prepared to head off potential conflicts through timely dialogue and negotiation, and to have available a pool of peacekeepers to act where necessary. The Kingdom of Swaziland welcomes the Secretary- General?s report to the Security Council regarding the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa. 11 In this regard, we support the concept of an integrated approach to conflict resolution on our continent as a way of enhancing closer cooperation between Africa and the rest of the world and making the best use of the resources at our disposal. The Kingdom of Swaziland is already engaged in efforts to become more involved in conflict resolution. To this end, we have welcomed the support of the United Kingdom and of the United States of America towards the preparation of our defence force for participation in peacekeeping operations in Africa and around the world. Of particular concern has been the evidence in the past year of the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and their use as instruments of aggression and intimidation. We in the Kingdom of Swaziland reaffirm the view of the Non- Aligned Movement that there can be no moral justification for the ownership, manufacture or use of such weapons. We join the majority of States Members of the United Nations in calling for real commitment by all countries to global disarmament and to the creation of a world that will be free and safe for future generations. In this respect, we urge all nations that have not done so to become parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). It may be said that the crises we have mentioned so far have been the result of man?s worst qualities and therefore unnecessary and avoidable. The same is not true of the many natural disasters that have struck hard at nations across the globe, irrespective of development status. The “El Niño” phenomenon has resulted in a series of natural disasters, the latest example being widespread flooding throughout the Americas, Asia, Africa and parts of Europe. Meanwhile, ironically, we in southern Africa must wait once more to see if we will receive sufficient rain for our crops this year. The establishment by the United Nations of the Office of Humanitarian Affairs could not have come at a more opportune time, and the Kingdom of Swaziland gives its full support for its operations. We hope that its role will include assistance to Member States to develop emergency relief mechanisms so that we may all be better prepared to cope with disasters of all kinds in the future. The Secretary-General recently gave warning of the deteriorating global economic situation and the widening gap between rich and poor nations. The crisis in Asia has had a devastating effect on the people of that region, and now all the indications are that the economies of the rest of the world will also be adversely affected. The two certainties are that the worst is yet to come, and that it will be the developing world that will be hardest hit. In this interdependent world of ours, the Kingdom of Swaziland recognizes the importance of the concept of partnership between nations. We agree that no nation can afford to remain isolated and that there is an obligation — and an economic necessity — for the more developed countries to support and assist those of us in the developing world. We believe that the underlying principle of any partnership should be one of mutual respect and understanding of each partner?s views, beliefs and position. We look forward to working with our partners in areas that our people have chosen as their development priorities, in an atmosphere of trust and openness, and free from the imposition of conditions that can impact negatively on our capacity to improve. The process of globalization is now well advanced. The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that a good deal more time and preparation are needed before we in the developing world are ready to cope with the additional responsibilities that globalization will bring. The United Nations provides the ideal forum for discussion of these matters; let us make full use of our Organization, in an atmosphere of true respect between partners, so that the positions of all may be understood and appreciated. As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Kingdom of Swaziland appreciates the efforts of the United Nations to integrate human rights issues into all its policies and programmes. The Kingdom of Swaziland has taken and continues to take seriously its obligations to its people on human rights issues. Furthermore, we support all initiatives aimed at improving the status of women, youth and children. They have a vital role to play in the development of a nation in all aspects of life. The ongoing constitutional review is, inter alia, promoting the debate on human rights issues. It is unfortunate to note that, even as we celebrate 50 years of existence of the Universal Declaration of Human 12 Rights, there is one nation of 21.8 million people that we believe is denied the right of membership of the United Nations. I am referring to the question of the Republic of China on Taiwan. The Kingdom of Swaziland continues to raise this issue because of our conviction that the United Nations Charter provides for the representation of all nations of the world. Furthermore, the Republic of China on Taiwan has shown very clearly that it is a nation with the willingness and capacity to play a prominent and responsible role in global development affairs, and yet it remains excluded from the activities of the one truly global development organization. The principle of universality, as contained in our founding Charter, provides that all citizens of the world have the right to be heard in these chambers, and yet it is a fact that as I speak the people of the Republic of China on Taiwan are not represented here and therefore cannot contribute their resources and expertise for the benefit of the international community through the medium of the United Nations. The Republic of China on Taiwan has shown itself to be a peace-loving nation, with a high level of political, economic and social development. It has an excellent record of supporting development activities throughout the world. The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the time has now come to restore its rightful membership of the United Nations to the Republic of China on Taiwan. We join the rest of our fellow members in proposing a review of this issue, with full regard for the change in circumstances since the decision was taken in 1971 which led to the expulsion of the Republic of China on Taiwan from our Organization. The problem of drug abuse and trafficking is a relatively new phenomenon among the people of Swaziland, but it is fast becoming a major threat to the development of our country, particularly among our youth, who seem to be the easiest target. The Kingdom of Swaziland welcomed the special session of the General Assembly on drugs, held in June this year, as a timely and necessary initiative. We therefore have high expectations of the recommendations that emerged from the special session, and we commit ourselves fully to their implementation. We recognize, though, that the drug trade is cross-border and international in nature, and we are working closely with our neighbours and regional partners to share ideas and resources in a combined effort to prevent the spread of the drug trade. The Kingdom of Swaziland condemns international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We believe there can be no justification for the type of outrage that was witnessed recently in Nairobi, Kenya; Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania; and Cape Town, South Africa. The deaths of so many innocent people can surely bring no credit to — and win no support for — those who planned and committed the deeds. Our prayers are offered again for the victims and their families and to all whose lives have been affected by the evils of terrorism. We support all moves to bring the perpetrators to justice and to prevent the spread of the use of terrorism tactics. In this regard, the Kingdom of Swaziland welcomes the establishment of the International Criminal Court following the Rome Conference. We believe it to be well timed and justified, and we are of the view that the international nature of terrorism and drug-trafficking make it essential that they be included as crimes that will fall under the jurisdiction of the Court. We are confident that the General Assembly will give urgent priority to the establishment of the Preparatory Commission so that the Court itself will become operational in the shortest possible time. The United Nations remains the only global forum in which the world can have any hope of achieving the goals we all strive for. Peace and stability among all nations, promotion of sustainable development for all, and the hope of future prosperity and security for all our peoples: these are the wishes and expectations of those we represent here. Our peoples look to this Organization to create the right conditions for these things to be possible. We cannot let them down. I give my assurance that the Kingdom of Swaziland will work hard to support the Secretary- General and his staff in their efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations operations. We are deeply grateful for the assistance given by the United Nations in support of the initiatives we are undertaking in our country. Finally, on behalf of His Majesty the King, Her Majesty the Indlovukazi, the Queen Mother, the Government and the whole Swazi nation, I am proud to take this opportunity to reaffirm the Kingdom?s commitment to the ideals and aims of the Charter of the United Nations.   Allow me to begin by congratulating Mr. Didier Opertti, on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Angola, on his election to the presidency of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. We are convinced that his experience, wisdom and diplomatic skills will help us to achieve the goals we set for this new session. Angola is especially pleased by the election of a representative from Uruguay, a country that has greatly contributed to the preservation of peace and security in the world, as was recently demonstrated by its participation in the United Nations peacekeeping operation in Angola. I should like to pay tribute to the outgoing President for the manner in which he conducted the work of this important body during his mandate. And a word of appreciation goes also to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his dynamism and for the wisdom he has demonstrated at the helm of our Organization. Almost 10 years have passed since the end of the East-West confrontation. We had hoped that by this time there would have been a greater positive impact on the international scene, especially regarding peace and security, and economic development. Unfortunately, in spite of the progress we have made — particularly in the promotion of democratic values and in the greater respect for human rights, among others — we are still witnessing the proliferation of internal armed conflicts, violent border disputes among nations, military aggression against independent and sovereign States, continued degradation of the environment, and economic decline with the consequent social and economic deterioration, especially in developing countries. We are also witnessing an increase 10 in transnational organized crime and terrorism, which poses a serious threat to the stability of all nations. This scenario casts a shadow over the prospects for the rapid implementation of the new political world order that emerged as a result of the end of the cold war, which would bring peace, stability, development and democracy. We still have a long way to go. It is incumbent on the United Nations, given its universal character and singular role in international relations, to shoulder the main responsibility in the search for solutions to all the problems that have become obstacles to achieving peaceful development and the well-being of our peoples, and in devising fair and effective formulas that meet the collective interests of its Members. The question of conflict resolution and prevention should be given high priority, for this will ensure the alleviation of tension in the world. The urgent creation of early-warning mechanisms will certainly enable the international community to act in a timely manner to prevent the triggering of potential conflicts, thus avoiding the repetition of past mistakes, such as those we have seen recently in Africa. In this connection, Angola shares the views of the Secretary-General as expressed in the recommendations in his report (A/52/871) on the prevention of conflict and the promotion of sustainable development in Africa, and hopes that the members of the Security Council will turn them into practical action. United Nations international arms control efforts should not be restricted to weapons of mass destruction. We must urgently focus on the issue of small arms and other war matériel sold to terrorist groups by some producer countries. These supplies have led to an increase in armed actions by subversive groups and are an incentive to all those who wish to take power by force. We believe that the creation of special mechanisms for the control of small- arms exports to armed groups, as well as the imposition of restrictive measures against those States that violate them, could help to stop the proliferation of weapons around the world. The United Nations, in cooperation with regional and subregional organizations, should promote the creation of collective defence and security mechanisms as a means to prevent the threat of conflict and guarantee the territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty of States. The United Nations will not be able to face many of its challenges unless it can count on the commitment and engagement of its Member States. This is especially true with respect to the resolution of its financial crisis and the reform of its structures to conform to the new international reality. We feel encouraged by the reforms undertaken by the Secretary-General aimed at turning the Organization into a more dynamic and effective body. The reform process must be thorough and include the United Nations main bodies, especially the Security Council. The Council’s current structure is outdated. Angola supports eliminating the current geographical imbalance in the composition of the Security Council by increasing the number of both permanent and non- permanent members to ensure that the main regions of the world are fairly represented. The claim of the African continent to at least two permanent seats should be adequately addressed, not only because the region is not currently represented at all, but also because it is the largest regional group in the United Nations. Angola also supports the Brazilian claim to a permanent seat given the exceptional role the country has played in United Nations activities in all areas, and especially because it belongs to a region that has no permanent members in the Security Council. The Republic of Angola is facing a difficult and critical phase in its history. We cannot yet announce the end of the war and the beginning of a new era of consolidation of democracy in Angola. The peace process and all related efforts made by both the Angolan Government and the international community are blocked due to UNITA’s deliberate, systematic non-compliance with the provisions of the Lusaka Protocol, the pertinent Security Council resolutions and Angolan law. Mr. Jonas Savimbi has demonstrated his unwillingness to transform UNITA into a civilian political party. As Members are aware, the Lusaka Protocol, signed by the Government and UNITA in 1994, should have led to the end of the internal conflict, which was resumed by UNITA after its defeat in the 1992 general elections. But, four years since the agreement came into force the peace process has yet to be concluded, and, what is even more dangerous, it has suffered serious setbacks due to the successive obstacles raised by UNITA’s militarist wing, led by Mr. Savimbi. UNITA deliberately deceived the United Nations and the international community when it declared that it was totally demilitarized. As the Security Council itself could determine, UNITA continues to 11 maintain active military units with sophisticated weaponry. UNITA has also hindered the process of normalization of State administration by refusing to abandon the areas it illegally occupies. At the same time, it has initiated a new escalation of hostilities throughout the country, unleashing armed attacks against local government authorities, the national police and the national armed forces, while also engaging in massacres of the civilian population. Hundreds of people have been killed, mostly civilians; about a million have been displaced; and UNITA has reoccupied areas where State administration had already been normalized. The United Nations Blue Helmet units and humanitarian convoys have also been targets of UNITA’s military actions, which constitute crimes against humanity, given their nature and characteristics as well as the coldness and cruelty with which they are committed. They are terrorist crimes as defined by international human rights and humanitarian law instruments. The international community cannot passively watch these systematic abuses, which flout international legal and moral values. During the recent summit in Durban, South Africa, the heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement condemned Jonas Savimbi for these systematic human rights abuses. Similarly, the heads of State or Government of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) — well aware of the seriousness of the Angolan situation, which has had terrible repercussions for the whole region — held Mr. Savimbi solely responsible for the current stalemate in the application of the Lusaka Protocol. Due to Mr. Savimbi’s staunch pursuit of war as the only means to attain political power, he is continuing to reinforce his military wing’s capabilities. This behaviour was declared by SADC to be that of a war criminal. As has been done in some other regions of the world, Mr. Savimbi and perhaps his closest collaborators — who together are responsible for all the war crimes committed in Angola — should be made to respond in court for the heinous crimes they have committed over many years. Throughout the peace process, Jonas Savimbi’s stance has revealed a personal strategy aimed at creating generalized chaos in the country in order to take power by force. The facts are clear: it does not make sense for UNITA to resort to armed struggle against a State where political activity is not restricted and where UNITA participates in its main political institutions — namely, the Government and Parliament. Furthermore, Angola’s armed forces include hundreds of UNITA members, including generals. It is unacceptable to have a political organization such as UNITA, which is not even subject to international law, challenging each and everyone, including the Security Council by blatantly and systematically violating its resolutions. UNITA itself is being penalized because of one man, Mr. Savimbi, who abuses the good faith of his countrymen who believed in UNITA as a credible political alternative in the emerging political system of the fledgling Angolan democracy. For all those reasons, the Security Council in resolution 1127 (1997) tried to separate the wheat from the chaff. In the course of imposing new sanctions against UNITA, the Council issued a list of UNITA members universally considered dangerous elements. This list is headed by Mr. Savimbi, who is thereby forbidden to freely circulate in the world. Only a criminal would receive such a sanction from the international community. Along those lines, the Angolan Government has suspended UNITA members from participation in the Government. The Government demanded a clarification of their position vis-à-vis the peace process in Angola: either they are in favour of peace and democracy, or, like their leader, they choose war as a means to take political power. All those who chose peace have since resumed the activities for which they had been appointed within the framework of the Government of Unity and National Reconciliation. Recently, political leaders and party cadres, together with officers from UNITA, made it clear that they did not support war as does Mr. Jonas Savimbi. On 2 August, they issued a political manifesto denouncing Mr. Savimbi’s behaviour and, in an effort to revitalize UNITA, they created a Renovation Committee which removed Mr. Savimbi from the leadership of the party. The goals defended by the UNITA Renovation Committee in its political manifesto are those of peace and the consolidation of democracy. This renovation movement supports the peace accords, national reconciliation and the effective transformation of UNITA into a civilian political party, and it has given a new breath of hope for the conclusion of the peace process. For that reason, the Angolan Government has decided to recognize UNITA’s Renovation Committee as its only interlocutor and partner in the implementation of outstanding tasks in the Lusaka Protocol. The SADC countries have already recognized the Renovation Committee, and we are convinced that the international community at large will not hesitate to support and promote the efforts of the new UNITA leadership as it 12 assumes its role in the young, multi-party democracy in Angola. The Government of Angola does not believe it is either prudent or realistic, but rather, dangerous, to yet again give Mr. Savimbi the benefit of the doubt. This would only lead to more false expectations, and we would be wasting much valuable time to take appropriate measures in this respect. In the light of the new situation in UNITA, the Angolan Government feels optimistic and therefore is still committed to the successful conclusion of the Lusaka Protocol. It will, however, continue to take all necessary measures against those who pursue attempts to disrupt the political order, so as to guarantee the territorial integrity of the country and the protection of its citizens. From this rostrum we want to draw the attention of countries, such as the Togolese Republic and Burkina Faso to the fact that the Government of Angola will not continue to tolerate the support they are providing to UNITA’s militarist wing led by Mr. Savimbi. This includes facilities for military training for these groups to commit terrorist acts in Angola. This is a clear violation of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Charter, the United Nations charter and Security Council resolutions 864 (1993), 1127 (1997) and 1173 (1998). I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my Government’s heartfelt tribute to the efforts and role of the United Nations in the peace process in Angola, and especially the contribution of the late Matre Blondin Beye, former Special Representative of the Secretary-General, in support of peace in Angola. I would also like to reiterate my Government’s appeal to the international community to continue to render humanitarian assistance to the displaced people in Angola and to assist in the rehabilitation of social and economic infrastructures. Angola is also concerned about events in other areas around the world. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the military invasion by foreign forces is a serious threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country. This could also destabilize the central and southern regions of the continent. This led some countries, including Angola, to consent to the request for military aid by the Congolese authorities within the framework of the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security. The recent summit in Victoria Falls of the leaders of the countries involved in the problem is a step in the right direction for the resolution of the crisis. Angola supports the withdrawal of the invading troops and the drafting of an agreement that ensures respect by all countries in the region of the independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This would enable that country’s authorities to begin the task of establishing a broad internal dialogue that should lead to general elections in 1999, in accordance with the democratization programme established by President Kabila. Angola welcomes the reinstatement of the legitimately elected authorities in Sierra Leone and the initiation of the process of the return of the refugees. Angola hopes this is the beginning of the normalization of the situation in that country. In Guinea-Bissau, the signing of a ceasefire agreement between the Government and the junta opens broad opportunities for a negotiated end to the conflict. We salute and encourage the efforts being developed by the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP), where Angola, along with the countries of the region, will continue to contribute to their efforts to foster reconciliation between brothers and sisters in Guinea- Bissau. In Western Sahara, the obstacles placed in the path of a peaceful solution have been progressively removed. Angola continues to believe that a referendum held on the basis of fairness and justice is the best means for the people in the territory to choose their own destiny. We support the continuation of United Nations and OAU joint efforts. We would also like to call the attention of the international community to the problem of Somalia. Although we recognize that the parties to the conflict have the primary responsibility for finding a peaceful solution, we believe this will be possible only with the support of the United Nations. We regret the lack of significant progress in the Middle East peace process. Angola encourages the parties to comply with the commitments made under the Oslo agreement. We continue to defend the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, and we advocate a rapid and fair resolution of the issues of the occupied Arab territories, including Palestine, which should take into account the interests of all the peoples in the region. 13 We believe that this will ease the tensions in Arab-Israeli relations. The situation in East Timor, a territory with which Angola shares linguistic links and a common anti-colonial struggle, has recently seen positive developments as a result of the understanding reached between Indonesia and Portugal, under the auspices of the United Nations on the reduction of the Indonesian military presence in the territory, will contribute to the achievement of a peaceful solution. Angola reaffirms its support for the struggle of the people of East Timor for their right to self-determination. The current world economic situation raises serious concerns, since it contributes directly to the deterioration of the standards of living of millions of human beings, especially those in developing countries. We are concerned by the imposition of unilateral restrictions to free trade and financial and economic cooperation, such as the embargo imposed against Cuba. Its victims are the most vulnerable groups in society: women and children. The extraterritorial nature of these measures runs counter to international law and does not contribute to forging links of friendship among peoples. We believe that we urgently need to promote international economic cooperation based on a partnership that will allow all those that participate in the process to share equitably in its gains. In spite of the implementation of endless reforms and structural adjustment programmes, as recommended by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the economies of developing countries continue to make such modest advances that we must question the real objectives of such reforms. We join with those who have spoken before us in reiterating our need to consider establishing a new international economic order that is more real, more fair and more equitable, capable of strengthening the international financial system and supporting national efforts to promote economic development throughout the world. It is not enough to appeal to the understanding of the developed countries. We need to be more strongly involved in the transformation of the international economic picture. The application of measures that would have an immediate impact, accompanied by well-structured programmes, such as the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative for Africa, deserve special attention if they are to attain the success we expect of them. The Final Declaration of the twelfth summit of non- aligned countries, recently held in Durban, South Africa, also defines some steps that can be taken to solve the crisis, among which it underscores an increase in South- South cooperation. This year, we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This occasion should be an incentive to develop effective instruments to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, since non-respect of these rights is the main cause of conflict and instability. The establishment of the International Criminal Court will be a significant step in this direction. The Angolan Government is sparing no effort to promote, protect and defend all human rights. Were it not for the bellicose behaviour of Mr. Savimbi, Angola would have hosted, late this year, the first ministerial conference of the Organization of African Unity on human and peoples’ rights in Africa. That initiative was my Government’s contribution to the jubilee of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In conclusion, let me emphasize the role the United Nations is playing to promote and protect human rights throughout the world.  On behalf of my delegation, I extend to you, Sir, our sincere congratulations on your election to the high post of President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. We wish you every success in discharging your very responsible mission. I would also like to express my profound acknowledgement to the President of the General Assembly at its previous session, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, who also happens to be my predecessor as Ukraine?s Foreign Minister, for his efficient and fruitful work here. I believe that the results of the fifty-second session deserve our positive evaluation, for they gave a strong impetus to the process of a wide-scale reshaping and strengthening of the United Nations. The last session will undoubtedly enter history as the session of reform. I am very pleased to note that many previous speakers have attributed those achievements to a large extent to the skilful and fair presidency of the Ukrainian representative. This provides undeniable evidence that our nation is not only a consistent supporter of, but also an active participant in, the process aimed at reforming the Organization. May I also applaud Secretary-General Kofi Annan, whose tireless efforts to initiate and promote this challenging goal deserve not only words of praise but, first and foremost, our active support. The efficiency of the future functioning of the United Nations will be determined by its ability to respond adequately to the challenges confronting humanity at the start of the twenty-first century. The promotion of an interrelated and integral world, the search for universal human harmony, the protection and further development of the values of our civilization, and free access to them — these are the main priorities on which the United Nations should concentrate its authority and attention. It is widely acknowledged that the main feature of the present development of the world community is the globalization of political, social, economic and humanitarian life. The advanced development of information and communication technologies and the interdependence of the economic progress of countries, with their closely interwoven market of goods, capital and labour, bring together local processes, separate events, States and international institutions into a worldwide network. A great advantage of globalization is the possibility of resolving problems of individual regions and countries by using the world?s experiences and the approaches that have proved to be most efficient. On the other hand, recent years have been marked by some of the adverse effects of globalization. The financial crisis in Asia and Russia, whose repercussions have been acutely felt all over the world, has become a subject of special preoccupation in almost every country. In this regard, Ukraine fully shares the view that the social and economic impact of globalization should become a top priority on the agenda of the world community today. The United Nations, which bears responsibility for international stability and sustainable economic development, has to find the means and tools that could help overcome the negative impact of globalization. In this respect, I wish to recall and reiterate the initiative of the President of Ukraine, officially announced in this Hall in 1995, to establish a new United Nations economic security council. In the meantime, Member States could also entrust the Security Council with additional assignments and the responsibility to deal with economic and social challenges that have direct repercussions for international peace and security. 18 Furthermore, there are other issues which cause discord and division among nations. These are the problems of national minorities, deported peoples, refugees, the spread of terrorism and organized crime, illicit drug- trafficking and money-laundering. These challenges require greater responsibility on the part of individual countries and their leaders for their own policies, as well as concerted efforts by the world community to counteract them. All that means that the United Nations, as never before, faces the urgent task of harmonizing all human and national interests and creating a world order whereby a national idea is not opposed to global solutions. Hence, Member States should care more for regional and universal security in order to maintain peace and stability without prejudice to their national interests. Events of last summer once again highlighted the issue of nuclear non-proliferation as pivotal for the world community. This issue remains a cornerstone and fundamental principle of preserving the world from a global conflict. Nuclear tests conducted by two nations in confrontation testify to the increasing urgency of expediting the entry into force of international agreements in the field of nuclear disarmament, as well as the need to ban other types of weapons of mass destruction. The issue of nuclear disarmament and non- proliferation has a special meaning for Ukraine as a nation which inherited the world?s third largest nuclear arsenal and voluntarily renounced it and which suffered from the largest technogenic disaster of this century in Chernobyl. Ukraine has made an unprecedented and exemplary decision to initiate the process of practical nuclear disarmament, and it strictly honours its obligations undertaken in this field. That is why we believe that we have the moral right to urge other countries, first and foremost nuclear ones, to pursue further reductions and, in the long run, to destroy totally their nuclear potentials. We also call upon the so-called threshold nations to abandon their nuclear ambitions. The world community should take effective measures to create reliable mechanisms for the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and control over the implementation of relevant international agreements. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is in fact the only internationally binding document that consolidates the world community around the concept of global security. Hence, we have to substantially revitalize the efforts of the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for its support. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), signed by most United Nations Member States, is also of exceptional significance. Ukraine, as one of its first signatories, calls upon the States which hesitate to accede to it to make this document effective as soon as possible. As a positive example, it is worthwhile to note the recent signing of the CTBT by Brazil and Spain. We welcome this important decision by these two friendly countries. For many years, the Conference on Disarmament has been playing an important role as a catalyst in freeing humanity from the burden of armaments, first and foremost, the nuclear ones. Ukraine, which a few years ago joined that body as a full member, continues to contribute to the success of its activity. I am glad to mention that it was under the presidency of Ukraine?s representative at the Conference that the elaboration of the treaty of the prohibition of fissile material reached its final stage. As other priorities for the Conference, we are considering elaboration of a programme of global nuclear disarmament and of a multilateral agreement on granting security guarantees to non-nuclear nations by the nuclear Powers. The contemporary age which has replaced the period of global confrontation has set new challenges before the United Nations in the field of international security. These include the growing numbers of local, mostly inter-ethnic conflicts inside countries, which cause civil wars and involve other nations. Moreover, these conflicts spread across regions or even turn into major international conflicts and become the source of global instability. We are deeply convinced that the international community must not be reconciled to the age of “cold war” being replaced by the age of “hot peace”. Finding an adequate remedy to these dangerous phenomena is one of the main issues that the United Nations should address today. Ukraine, with a population of over 50 million comprising 100 nationalities, has always pursued the policy of maintaining stability and social accord in its society. For seven years of its independent existence, our country, contrary to pessimistic predictions, has succeeded in avoiding ethnic tensions, regional division or fragmentation of the society. This has been possible thanks to the persistent efforts of all branches of State power aimed at the comprehensive development of democratic institutions and legal protection of national minorities. This policy is enshrined in the Constitution of Ukraine that was adopted two years ago. 19 Conflict prevention remains one of the biggest challenges for the United Nations, especially the Security Council. It requires constant attention to potential sources of tension and immediate and adequate measures to prevent these tension points from growing into bigger conflicts. In this context, I would like to underscore the pressing need for strengthening the mechanism of United Nations global monitoring and early warning of threats to international peace and security in order to facilitate the Security Council?s readiness for a timely and efficient response. An important role in this respect is played by international sanctions which make it possible to exert pressure without resorting to force. We believe, however, that the mechanism of introducing sanctions requires serious improvement. First of all, there is urgent need to work out an efficient tool for compensation for losses incurred by third countries observing the sanctions. Regrettably, all previous resolutions adopted by the General Assembly to assist such countries so far remain unimplemented, leaving some countries of Central and Eastern Europe, in particular, to cope on their own with their uncompensated economic losses. It is a recognized fact that peace and stability on the European continent are an inseparable part of the global security system. Ukraine views the future architecture of European security as one based on the principles of comprehensiveness, indivisibility and partnership. This fundamental position determines our country?s active cooperation with European and Euro-Atlantic security structures, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union. Ukraine also actively advocates the further strengthening of the role of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as an important all-European tool for safeguarding stability on the continent by means of political mediation, protection of human and minorities? rights, strengthening of democracy and humanitarian activity. Closer cooperation and coordination of efforts between the United Nations and the OSCE should be established by making it a good practice to organize regular meetings between senior officials of the two organizations. For Ukraine, a country of Central and Eastern Europe, establishment of friendly and partnership relations with its neighbours is of great importance. In line with this policy, last June Kiev hosted the first round of expert consultations among a number of Black Sea States to work out joint confidence-building and security measures in the naval military field in the Black Sea region. Thus, actively shaping a favourable security environment, Ukraine is asserting itself as a natural strategic link between various regions, for the North and South, East and West. That is why it was not accidental that the initiative of Ukraine?s President Leonid Kuchma to convene in September 1999 in Yalta an international summit conference entitled “The Baltic-Black Sea Cooperation: towards an integrated Europe of the twenty-first century without dividing lines” has received broad support. Contributing to the solution of vital global issues by fostering internal harmony in society, projecting stability on its environment through its active participation in non- proliferation and peacekeeping, by shaping a vast network of regional cooperation, Ukraine, as one of the United Nations founding members, gives top priority to strengthening international peace and security and aspires to be elected next year as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the period 2000-2001. This year the world community is marking the fiftieth anniversary of United Nations peacekeeping activities. Over past decades, peacekeeping operations have grown into an effective instrument of preventing the escalation of armed conflicts. While it is true that not all of the United Nations peacekeeping missions have been equally successful, the overall evaluation of United Nations activities in this field should be considered positive. Despite enduring hardship conditions, and often at risk to their health and even their lives, the “Blue Helmets” courageously perform a noble mission of bringing peace to peoples in the planet?s trouble spots. In this regard, I have the honour to propose that the Assembly adopt at the special commemorative meeting to be held on 6 October a declaration in commemoration of those who served in United Nations peacekeeping operations, an idea initiated by Ukraine. The recent practice of peacekeeping in various regions of the world demands the development of a comprehensive basic document comprising the conceptual principles of a new generation of peacekeeping operations. These principles should have an integrated block of military, civil, humanitarian, political, legal and other aspects of such operations. We are convinced that strengthening the United Nations peacekeeping potential should become an integral component of the process of United Nations reform. In this context, I should like to reiterate the need to reinforce the United Nations rapid reaction capabilities by perfecting the United Nations standby arrangements and making energetic efforts to set up the rapidly deployable 20 mission headquarters. Ukraine has made a practical contribution to United Nations peacekeeping operations, in particular in the former Yugoslavia and in some of the Commonwealth of Independent States countries. We are ready to continue our active participation in peacekeeping and to commit additional resources to United Nations standby arrangements. Our country supports all measures necessary to enhance the security of United Nations peacekeepers and missions. In this regard, we call upon those States which have not done so to accede to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel in order to facilitate its entry into force as soon as possible. While globalization has become a driving force at the international level, and liberalization and economic reforms a dominating tendency within nations, international economic cooperation based on the principles of non- discrimination, fair competition, partnership and mutual benefit has become increasingly relevant. The United Nations should continue to play a leading role in creating effective mechanisms for such cooperation. We believe that the Organization?s social and economic activities should focus more on countries with economies in transition to accelerate their integration into the world economy. International assistance will be helpful for a smoother conduct of economic reforms in such countries and for overcoming the inevitable difficulties in transforming national economies. Subsequently, these nations will achieve a level of economic development and thus be able to help other countries. The experience of some countries of Central and Eastern Europe proves that such a prospect is quite possible. Based on this knowledge, Ukraine?s course towards the complete and comprehensive integration of its national economy into the European and global economic systems remains unchanged. I should like to place special emphasis on Ukraine?s strategy of integration into the European Union, endorsed by the President of our country. This strategy provides for the harmonization of national legislation and the intensive development of trade and economic relations with European Union members based on the partnership and cooperation agreement that entered into force last March. I avail myself of this opportunity to commend the countries of the European Union for their support, so clearly expressed by the Austrian Presidency. We attach great importance to the regional component of international economic cooperation. Ukraine was one of the initiators of the regional economic process within the framework of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) and of the BSEC?s establishment as a fully fledged international organization. We think that today the Black Sea Economic Cooperation organization has full grounds for claiming observer status in the General Assembly. This year we are also marking another event of historic significance: the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which has become a milestone in the quest of the individual to find his or her own identity in society. This Declaration provided a powerful impetus to the development of the international system of protection of human rights, the creation of the relevant branch of international law, and the introduction of a ramified system of control over the fulfilment by States of their commitments in the field of human rights. The Declaration remains a crucial element of all human rights activities within the United Nations and a model for constitutional practice in many parts of the world. For instance, the Constitution of Ukraine, which provides that safeguarding human rights and freedoms make up the essence of national policy, is based on the humanistic ideas of the Declaration. An entire series of events dedicated to the fiftieth anniversary of this Universal Declaration is under way in Ukraine. The most important of them was the International Conference organized early this month in Yalta by our Government together with the United Nations Development Programme, which was attended by representatives from 27 countries and a number of international organizations; a booklet on that Conference has been circulated to members. A new Yalta spirit associated with the observance of human rights and freedoms was proclaimed at the Conference. This spirit is best protected in the context of the growing role of international law. I believe that it is a matter of honour for all States Members of this Organization to strictly abide by their commitments to the United Nations Charter and the fundamental principles of international law, in particular as regards respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, the peaceful settlement of disputes, and the strengthening of the role of preventive diplomacy. 21 Ukraine supports the proposals to strengthen the International Court of Justice, which reflects the increasing tendency to resolve international disputes by means of law. The Security Council and other United Nations bodies should consider making better use of the International Court?s potential when dealing with international disputes. Equally important is the setting up of the International Criminal Court, which should be considered in the context of the global changes that have taken shape after the end of the cold war. The importance of this international judicial institution is supported by the fact that its jurisdiction covers the most serious crimes committed against humankind. Following the recognized principle of pacta sunt servanda, Ukraine rigorously adheres to its commitments under international instruments and to the standards and rules of its national legislation, which are applied in accordance with the norms of international law. The decisions on United Nations reform adopted at the fifty-second session of the General Assembly represent only an initial stage of the Organization?s sweeping transformation. Painstaking work is needed to translate them into practice so that the United Nations can enter the new millennium renewed and able efficiently to address the persisting challenges of the present time. It is therefore necessary to continue with wide-scale structural adjustments and the reorganization of United Nations programme activities to make them more results- oriented, businesslike and tailored to the needs of the Member States. The key issue in renewing the United Nations is the reform of the Security Council. Unfortunately, prompt resolution of this fundamental question does not appear to be forthcoming, as the issue has obviously stagnated. It is in the interest of the international community as a whole to make every effort to achieve a consensus decision on the reform of this important United Nations body. It is impossible to imagine a reformed United Nations without this crucial issue having been resolved. To make decisive progress in shaping a more reliable and predictable world and promoting economic prosperity, social justice and ecological safety, we must demonstrate perseverance, courage and political will. Near-universal membership, a far-reaching mandate, a broad spectrum of activities and the institutionalized presence of the United Nations at many levels can and should bring it to the centre of these efforts. The authority and efficiency of this world Organization depend entirely on the membership. If we wish to see the United Nations truly reformed and revitalized, we must prove it by our practical deeds. We must prove that people can continue to rely on the United Nations and that our Organization is prepared to respond to new challenges and withstand any tests. Allow me first of all to congratulate you, Mr. Opertti, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session and, at the same time, to wish you success in the performance of your important function. Your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, successfully headed the fifty-second session. I am convinced that, as a distinguished Latin American politician of great experience and energy, you will also make an outstanding contribution to the successful outcome of this session. Allow me also to express our deep appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his leadership and to extend to him our readiness for full cooperation. It is my special pleasure to address this Assembly on behalf of the Republic of Macedonia. My country managed to avoid the turmoil of the war on the former Yugoslav territory and to achieve its independence peacefully. We also managed not only to maintain our internal peace and stability but also to produce peace and stability in the troubled and volatile region of the Balkans. Under much more difficult conditions than those prevailing in the other countries in transition, we managed not only to finalize the reforms of the political and economic systems, but also to democratize society, to build the institutions of the state of law and to put into full function the mechanisms of market economy. In addition, we managed to emerge from the deep financial and economic crisis resulting from the high price we had to pay for these radical reforms, and, above all, from the losses we suffered due to the war in the region and the sanctions against our neighbour, Yugoslavia. According to the last report of the World Bank, the Republic of Macedonia, among all the countries in transition, today shares first place with Estonia in the results on macroeconomic plans and is in fourth place in the field of structural reforms. Over a number of years, my country has had a stable currency and an annual inflation rate of about 5 per cent, and this year has had an industrial production growth rate of over 10 per cent. The Republic of Macedonia, through its policy of equally good relations with all its neighbours, has managed to establish outstanding relations with almost all of them, particularly with the Republic of Slovenia, the Republic of Croatia, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Turkey, the Hellenic Republic and the Republic of Albania. It has also managed to become one of the most active countries in all of the regional initiatives in South-Eastern Europe. Having committed itself to full integration into the European and Euro-Atlantic structures, the Republic of Macedonia is investing great efforts to enhance its relations with the European Union and to fully integrate itself into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), thus contributing to the establishment of the new Euro-Atlantic security architecture and to the united Europe of the twenty-first century. The Republic of Macedonia has achieved all of this in a region in which, as is well known, we cannot yet speak of lasting peace and stability, due to the crisis in Bosnia, the crisis in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, the recent events in Albania and the stalled processes of democratization in some of the neighbouring countries. Other factors are the threats posed by illicit drug- trafficking, money-laundering, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and small arms, transnational and local terrorism and so forth. These are only some of the issues that burden the overall situation in the region I come from, but these are also issues that burden citizens worldwide. We still live in a period characterized by uncertainty and 15 unpredictability. Local wars and ethnic conflicts continue. The threat of weapons of mass destruction is increasingly alarming. Organized crime, illicit drug-trafficking and terrorism trouble the whole world. Financial and economic crises have become more frequent than ever, as have environmental disasters. These complex issues, together with the issue of globalization, which marks the end of this century and will prevail in the coming one, as well as the issue of the reform of our Organization, are the main issues of debate at this session. That is why my country, the Republic of Macedonia, attaches such enormous importance to this session, with the expectation that the decisions to be adopted in those respects will improve our mutual cooperation and will strengthen the role of the United Nations in the spirit of its Charter. In the twenty-first century, our Organization will face a lot of new challenges, which will differ from those we have dealt with during the past decades. The appropriate response to these challenges requires even further globalization of cooperation, through the United Nations, and we therefore should, in due time, do everything possible so that it will be prepared to tackle them. We believe that the Secretary-General?s reform programme is an excellent basis for this. These reforms are in the interest of all Member States, and we therefore fully endorse them. We believe that they should bring about substantial improvement in the work of all the bodies within the United Nations family. In that regard, we are in favour of the eventual increase in the number of permanent and non-permanent members of the Security Council, derived from and based upon real political relations among Member States. The processes of globalization that have engulfed our planet are irreversible. They enhance our possibilities for confronting international threats jointly, but they should also provide benefits for all participating countries. The United Nations is the only Organization which can define the principles, norms and rules, and which can give guarantees that both the obligations and the benefits will be shared by all members of the international community. Only in this way can we, all together, avoid the eventual negative effects of these processes of globalization. As a modest contribution in that regard, the Republic of Macedonia has submitted a draft resolution for this session on the prevention of marginalization of small and weakened economies of developing countries and of economies in transition. The international community is witnessing many new crises and conflicts, which most frequently turn into violence of an unprecedented intensity and fierceness. The United Nations has all along been engaged in their prevention and management. The lessons learned from the crisis of the region I come from have indicated that our Organization, in dealing with them, needs to take the following steps: first, concentrate on their root causes; secondly, concentrate on early warning; thirdly, activate preventive diplomacy for peaceful settlement of these disputes before violence arises; and fourthly, deploy preventive forces in the neighbouring regions or countries to prevent their eventual spillover. In 1992, when the war in Bosnia was spreading, endangering the regions to the south, as well as my country, which was not yet a Member of the United Nations, we requested the deployment of a preventive mission along our northern and western borders. The Security Council took a positive decision, and, as a result, the first preventive United Nations mission, the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP), was born. I avail myself of this opportunity to express the gratitude of my people and my country for this wise decision of the Security Council, to the troop-contributing countries — the United States of America, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark — and to all the other countries that have contributed to the stabilization of the situation along our northern and western borders. As members know, the UNPREDEP mission has all along also acted as a deterrent to possible conflicts in the region. This most successful preventive mission has always enjoyed the support of our citizens, as well as of my Government. We are particularly pleased that such positive assessments are contained in all the reports of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. We are convinced that last year?s crisis in Albania and the crisis in Kosovo, which has particularly intensified since the beginning of this year, would have had much more negative consequences on peace and stability in the region had the UNPREDEP mission not stayed in the Republic of Macedonia or had its stay been terminated last year, as some had proposed. Therefore, I would like to express our gratitude to all the States 16 members of the Security Council that adopted the resolution extending its stay. I would also like to point to the need for the UNPREDEP mission to stay in the Republic of Macedonia until the situation in neighbouring Albania stabilizes and the Kosovo crisis is peacefully settled. As an immediate neighbour, we are most interested in this and therefore, through our constructive policy, we are trying to make our own contribution to the efforts of the international community to resolve the Kosovo crisis. Even though we see the solution in the framework of the Republic of Serbia and within the internationally recognized borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, it is well known that conditions have not yet been created for a lasting settlement. Therefore, we believe that the interim solution proposed by the American diplomat Christopher Hill and the Contact Group will lead towards resolving this crisis. The sooner this temporary solution is accepted and implemented, the sooner will conditions be created for reaching a lasting settlement of the crisis in Kosovo, as well as for eliminating this threat to the stability of the region. Should this not happen, as an immediate neighbour we are most concerned by possible new waves of refugees, which could destabilize not only the countries of the region, but also those beyond. For the time being, this crisis has not significantly affected the peace and stability of the Republic of Macedonia, in which there lives a considerable Albanian minority. However, all of our citizens, regardless of their national or religious identity, are concerned by a possible deepening of the crisis. Though some initial steps have lately been made towards settling the Kosovo crisis and broader conditions have been established to that end — such as, for example, the decision of the Defence Ministers of the Partnership for Peace and of States members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) from South-East Europe, to establish the first multinational brigade for peace support operations; or the positive results of such regional initiatives as the Central European Initiative (CEI), the Royaumont Initiative, the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC), the Initiative of Cooperation of South-East Europe (SECI), and the process on security, stability and cooperation in South- Eastern Europe — recent events in Kosovo, in which a number of citizens were massacred, will very negatively affect the overall security situation. We condemn all such uncivilized acts and underline that this is not the way to overcome the disputes or to settle them peacefully. Therefore, we call for the full mobilization and harmonization of the activities of the international community, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the European Union and NATO, as well as our Organization, the United Nations, since we believe that the possibilities for a peaceful solution have not yet been exhausted. In that regard, my country has invested great efforts to make a constructive contribution. As is known, at previous sessions of the General Assembly, three resolutions for the development of good-neighbourly relations in South-East Europe that were proposed by the Republic of Macedonia were adopted unanimously. At this session, we have submitted a proposal for the adoption of a new draft resolution on the prevention of the violent disintegration of States. I hope that this draft resolution will also be adopted by acclamation. By this, the Republic of Macedonia is making a concrete contribution and giving strong support to the efforts of the United Nations to establish early warning of eventual conflicts, achieve political settlements of outstanding disputes, and avoid their short-, medium- and long-term consequences. In the period between the main parts of the fifty- second and fifty-third sessions of the General Assembly, our Organization undertook a great number of activities to resolve the current and to prevent the outbreak of new crises. The measures that could greatly contribute to preventing such violent conflicts certainly include the prosecution of war criminals and the punishment of the criminal acts and atrocities they have committed. The successful completion of the Conference on the creation of the International Criminal Court is of historical importance. The Republic of Macedonia has fully supported the outcome of the Rome Conference, as well as the Statute that was adopted by the majority of the attending countries, including my own. Now, the General Assembly should adopt the necessary decisions to allow the Court to assume its full functions. In that regard, no less important is the fact, that within a very short period of time, 40 countries, including the Republic of Macedonia, have ratified the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. Thus, the Republic of Macedonia has firmly reaffirmed its commitment to the full elimination of anti-personnel landmines, just as it has, by investing enormous efforts, made a great contribution to preventing 17 the proliferation of the small arms that abounded in the region following last year?s crisis in Albania. Human rights, democracy and the rule of law have proven to be the basic preconditions for the promotion of peace, security and the sustainable development of States. Since the very first days of its independence, the Republic of Macedonia has committed itself to the establishment of these preconditions. Today, as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we feel the need to particularly emphasize that the adoption of the declaration on the defenders of human rights will not only create new responsibilities for all the States Members of our Organization, but will also encourage all the activists who work for the protection of human rights throughout the world. As a country whose Constitution abolishes the death penalty, we support the draft protocols to the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention against Torture, as well as a broad scope of projects and programmes in the field of human rights, the rule of law and so on. Allow me to conclude by reaffirming the firm commitment of the Republic of Macedonia to the objectives and principles of the United Nations Charter. We are a small country that struggles for progress and development within a still troubled and unstable region. Perhaps that is why we so strongly feel the threats and the challenges that are common to the whole world. Thus, each and every State Member of the United Nations, regardless of size and human potential, should make its contribution to decreasing the risks of these threats and should also enjoy the benefits of the current processes of globalization. The survival of each State, of each people, of the whole planet depends on the common solidarity among all of us and on our common responsibility for future generations that could be united only here, in our common Organization, the United Nations.  Our presence here today is, for my delegation and my country, cause for some celebration. This is the thirtieth anniversary of our first participation in the General Assembly. Upon the attainment of our independence in 1968, the father of the nation, the then Prime Minister Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, addressed the United Nations. I join the speakers before me in congratulating Mr. Opertti on his assumption of the office of President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. I would also like to thank his predecessor, Mr. Udovenko, for the manner in which he conducted the work of the previous session. I wish to commend our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his wise leadership and vision, which have been a source of renewed confidence in the future of this Organization. We welcome his efforts to lead a reformed and more effective United Nations into the twenty-first century to better carry out our mission of peace, development and human rights. We wish to assure him of our total support in the continuation of the reform process. We are alive to the intense debate on the reform of the Security Council. We reiterate our position that the Security Council should be enlarged and made more democratic and representative. In this respect, we reaffirm our commitment to the stand taken by the Non-Aligned Movement at the recent Summit in Durban. In recent years the world has been profoundly transformed by the powerful forces of globalization and liberalization. All countries are now inextricably linked as distances between them become increasingly immaterial through great leaps in information technology and communications. The tremors triggered by the crises of the South-East Asian economies and, more recently, the turmoil in the world financial markets have shown in a dramatic way the dangers of the contagion effect. Even those countries which are trying to be efficient and competitive face the possibility of external shocks because of the volatility of capital markets. 7 I believe that the world community should devise creative and effective mechanisms to prevent emerging economies which have put in hard work from losing the fruits of liberalization. We must not go back to the inward-looking strategies of the 1960s. We must continue to open our economies, but with greater caution. This is a great challenge for a large majority of nations, particularly the least developed ones. We know only too well that a number of developing countries are among the most vulnerable and are not yet ready to integrate into the global economy. When I last addressed this Assembly, I dwelled at some length on the generally grim situation in Africa, which remains one of the most intractable challenges to the world community. It is a continent rich in natural resources and yet afflicted by widespread poverty. Peace and development in Africa have been, for more than a decade, the subject of endless debates and resolutions at the United Nations. But we know that sustainable development in Africa is conditional upon the achievement of a strife-free continent. It is sad indeed that year after year the number of potential flashpoints seems to grow more numerous. The situation in many regions of Africa remains a cause for great concern. The peoples of the continent can ill afford the pointless strife and violence visited upon them at a time when the priorities should be economic and social development. We in Africa naturally have to bear the primary responsibility for assuring lasting peace for our peoples. This is precisely what the leaders of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) are striving to achieve. In his statement to this Assembly, on Monday, President Nelson Mandela, current Chairman of SADC, mentioned the ongoing conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This difficult problem figured prominently on the agenda of the summit which Mauritius hosted a few days ago, after it was addressed earlier by the Victoria Falls meeting and the Pretoria special SADC summit. I wish to renew here our appeal to all parties involved in this conflict to solve their differences peacefully through political dialogue and diplomacy. In the Indian Ocean region to our immediate southwest, Mauritius is participating fully in the efforts of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and of the countries of that region to seek a peaceful resolution to the crisis facing the Comoros on account of separatist activities by a group on the island of Anjouan. Mauritius fully supports the unity and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of the Comoros. Fortunately, however, all is not gloom when we survey Africa. We note with satisfaction the continuous positive economic growth that most sub-Saharan countries have enjoyed lately. I had the privilege to participate in a round table together with the Deputy President of South Africa earlier this year, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, on the new competitive Africa. The consensus was that Africa stands at the threshold of a new era — an era of opportunity and dynamism. We are at the dawn of an African renaissance. Governments in Africa are becoming increasingly democratic and responsive, putting more emphasis on economic development, greater openness, market-oriented policies and greater economic reform. Regional cooperation is another positive feature of the new Africa, working through groupings such as SADC, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to facilitate cross-border trade leading to the ultimate establishment of an African Economic Community. But for Africa to realize its full potential, several serious constraints will have to be overcome. The international economic environment should be made less hostile to Africa. Africa’s shares of world trade and foreign direct investment still remain at a paltry level. The debt burden has become in itself a crippling factor and needs urgently to be alleviated. We also cannot sufficiently emphasize the importance of official development assistance in this regard. We therefore deeply deplore the decline in the levels of official development assistance among the major donor countries. Today, they stand at a historical low. We are now, more than ever, far off the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product recommended by this Assembly. This trend must be reversed. 8 Mauritius took the initiative recently of highlighting the specificities of small island economies in the context of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the negotiations of a successor agreement to the Lomé IV Convention. As a result, recent ministerial declarations adopted by both the WTO and the OAU now contain explicit references to small economies and their high vulnerability. This reality is now gaining recognition within the Bretton Woods institution. For the reasons I have just mentioned, small economies require time and space to adjust to the new world trade order. We therefore reiterate the need for the maintenance of non-reciprocal trade regimes until such a time as we are adequately prepared. The Lomé Convention is a model of North-South cooperation. The proposed United States African Growth and Opportunity Act could become another. Together with the other members of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), we would like to reaffirm our total support for its passage. Mauritius has always accorded the highest priority to regionalization to break out of its insularity and enlarge its economic base. Mauritius was a major player in launching, 15 years ago, the Indian Ocean Commission and, more recently, the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation. The Assembly will appreciate that an island State like Mauritius would be interested in the protection of the marine environment. We recommend for the particular attention of the General Assembly the report of the Independent World Commission on the Oceans, according to which the very survival of the human race over the long term is jeopardized by the abuses to which the world’s oceans are subjected. We have to address as a matter of priority the three most immediate dangers identified by the Commission: the overexploitation of marine biological resources, the dumping of toxic waste and the harmful effects of global warming. While much has been achieved since the Rio Earth Summit, we deplore the fact that the initial momentum and urgency appear to have been lost in sterile and fractious debate. I urge that we address these questions, on which our very survival depends, with renewed earnestness and a greater sense of shared responsibility. (spoke in French) In December we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption and proclamation by this Assembly of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For us, that will also provide an opportunity to recall another milestone in the history of human rights: the adoption by the French Constituent Assembly of the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen more than two centuries ago. At this historic moment, we wish to recall the preamble of the Charter of our Organization, which proclaims our “faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small”. We also reaffirm our profound belief in the equality of all rights — social, economic and cultural, as well as civil and political. Today, Governments can no longer flout the rights of their citizens without being subjected to the censure of the international community. Yet millions of inhabitants of many parts of the world remain deprived of their fundamental rights by oppressors and tyrants who govern by force. We have observed with horror the atrocious crimes against the dignity and worth of the human being committed during recent conflicts. My Government therefore welcomes the recent adoption in Rome of the Statute of the International Criminal Court. (spoke in English) My Government believes that respect for human rights is but one facet of the indispensable foundation of the harmonious development of a country. Democracy and transparent and accountable government, as well as effective participation by civil society, are the other essential ingredients for successful development. Considering the complex sociocultural and ethnic mix of our population, we have taken great care to ensure that all our citizens, regardless of their origins or gender, have equal access to education, adequate health care, proper housing and employment opportunities. We will soon introduce in our own National Assembly a protection of human rights bill, which will provide for the establishment of a National Human Rights Commission. At the continental African level, participants at the Third Conference of African Women Parliamentarians, which Mauritius was privileged to host, adopted the Port Louis Declaration, calling for increased political commitment at all levels for the promotion of gender 9 equality and the empowerment of women. We in Mauritius are taking legislative measures to translate our commitment into practical reality. We have now become even more aware of the need to seek global solutions to our common problems. Climate change, illicit drug-trafficking and terrorism are problems which require a coordinated international approach. No nation can live under a dome, with its climate isolated from the rest of the world. No country can on its own fight international drug traffickers or terrorism. We therefore condemn unequivocally all forms of terrorism and call for enhanced international cooperation to combat and prevent its occurrence. While social, economic and trade matters are increasingly — and with good reason — occupying centre stage in international forums, crucial problems of security and disarmament continue to retain their capacity to derail our efforts for development. Earlier this year we were reminded of the dangers for humanity of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the attendant risks of a new arms race. No country can feel genuinely secure as long as the threat of nuclear weapons exists from any quarter. In this respect, we welcome the stand taken by both India and Pakistan in exercising self- restraint. We reiterate our position that any international instrument for the elimination of nuclear arsenals should be non-discriminatory in nature. Security for all will be achieved only when that threat is completely eliminated. Global nuclear disarmament and the total elimination of all weapons of mass destruction must remain our ultimate goal. Finally, as on past occasions, we would like to bring up once more before this Assembly our lasting claim on the sovereignty of two territories which were taken from our patrimony: the island of Tromelin and the Chagos archipelago. We reiterate our call to the former colonial Powers to enter into constructive bilateral dialogue with my Government for the early restoration of those territories to the sovereignty of Mauritius. Regarding the Chagos archipelago, this Assembly should also be reminded that some 1,500 inhabitants — the so-called “Illois” — were coerced to leave their homeland to clear the way for a military base. Most of the families, who had lived for generations on these islands, were moved to the main island of Mauritius, victims of the then prevailing cold war. Today, after more than 30 years, they still experience tremendous difficulties adapting to their present conditions. Many yearn to be resettled on these islands. As we are about to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of this century’s seminal document on human rights, we consider that we owe it to these Illois to fully re-establish their rights, including the right of return. At the outset, Sir, let me extend to Mr. Opertti the felicitations of my delegation on his unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. We are confident that under his experienced leadership we will be able to achieve substantive progress in the deliberations of this Assembly. I should also like to take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, who presided over one of the most eventful sessions of the General Assembly. In particular, I would like to express our gratitude for his skilful stewardship of our deliberations on the reform package of the Secretary- General, which led to the successful completion of an important phase in the United Nations reform process. Last year the Secretary-General presented us with his most comprehensive and far-reaching proposals for the strengthening and reinvigoration of this Organization. We were also able to adopt two landmark resolutions, 52/12 A and 52/12 B, during the substantive part of the fifty- second session to enable us to reform this Organization and to introduce new mechanisms, including the Office of Deputy Secretary-General, to improve its performance. With these new mechanisms, the Organization has been able to renew the emphasis on economic, social and development activities. We are pleased that we have Ms. Fréchette, an outstanding person with vast experience, as the first Deputy Secretary-General of the Organization. Early this year we were able to take further steps to move forward the reform process, a process that is still continuing. We would like to thank the Secretary-General for his timely submission of reports and additional explanations in response to resolution 52/12 B. We hope that the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General will push forward the ongoing process. As a developing nation, we hope that the reform process will strengthen the ability of the United Nations to fulfil its role and functions in the field of development and to respond effectively to the development needs of the developing countries. In this respect, the establishment of a Development Account under the reform process is a welcome step. Forward movement in the overall reform of the United Nations is not matched by similar progress in the reform of the Security Council. We are somewhat disheartened over the lack of tangible results on the core issues in the deliberations of the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters Related to the Security Council. I am sure that every State Member of this Organization shares the view that the reform of the Security Council is one of the most crucial aspects of the entire United Nations reform process. This process will be considered by the world community as seriously inadequate, and much less genuine, if we fail to produce a Security Council that is truly representative of the present membership of this Organization and can effectively respond to future challenges. We do not believe that a body that is not democratic and representative can really look after the interests of the broad membership in its cardinal task of maintaining international peace and security. 11 We all have been engaged in in-depth and intensive discussions of the various aspects of the Security Council reform for almost five years now. Although we had had high hopes that the latest rounds of discussions of the Working Group would produce general agreement on the more contentious issues related to the Security Council, the desired goal remains elusive. We nevertheless are gratified to note that the Working Group has made encouraging headway in its deliberations on measures conducive to improving the working methods and transparency of the Council?s activities. We believe that expansion of the Security Council in a balanced manner is one of the main elements of Security Council reform. We are discouraged by the fact that it is on this core element that substantive differences among the delegations still remain. These fundamental differences have proved to be a major obstacle to our forward movement towards a general agreement on a common package. As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, we in general subscribe to the common position of the Movement on Security Council reform. However, we wish to make some observations on certain core issues on which we feel we should register our position. First of all, my delegation wishes to emphasize that the objective of the entire process of Security Council reform is not the mere addition of a couple of countries to its permanent membership. Although it has been accepted in principle that three permanent seats should be allotted to developing countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America, the mode of their identification and selection, despite various suggestions and concepts on the table, seems intractable at this juncture and remains unsettled. Myanmar would view with concern any move or measure biased towards particular candidates. Myanmar believes that countries which are capable of contributing to international peace and security should be permanent members in the expanded Council. We also favour the expansion of the Security Council in both permanent and non-permanent memberships. We are now being provided with an historic opportunity to devise ways of selecting new permanent members for the Security Council. Although there has been noticeably strong support for expansion of the Security Council in its permanent category, we have not been able to translate various ideas on this question into a viable formula acceptable to all. In this connection, the idea of rotating new permanent members, which the Organization of African Unity has decided to apply to the African countries, is a very significant concept. There appear to be a growing number of States attracted to it, and Myanmar is one of those countries. This is a concept submitted by a particular region for itself and not meant for export to other regions. Nevertheless, we should not rule out the concept as one of the possible options applicable to other regions such as Asia, in the event that other modalities of selection or options fail to command enough support. It is vitally important that expansion of the Security Council in both categories of membership take place simultaneously for all regions. Myanmar is one of the 74 members of the Organization which has never been a member of the Security Council. However deficient in its present structure and undemocratic in its practice the Security Council may be, its role in the maintenance of international peace and security and the contribution made by its members are highly appreciated by the Union of Myanmar. Myanmar has therefore always given serious attention to the annual election of five non-permanent members of the Security Council. At the same time, to enhance the role of non- permanent members, now generally looked upon as peripheral, we could seek a solution by improving the working methods of the Security Council. Inextricably linked to the expansion of the permanent membership of the Security Council is the veto. Debate on this question has been continuing both outside and inside the Organization since before the founding of the United Nations. Nevertheless, little has been done in the years since then to rectify its injustice. Given the present state of the discussions, the question promises to haunt us in the future, regardless of how strongly we may feel about the practice. While a large majority of Member States are demanding its curtailment and eventual elimination, permanent members continue to be entrenched in their position that they cannot accept any diminution of their rights and prerogatives, including the veto. In the context of extending the veto to new permanent members, two main views have emerged. One view argues for its extension to new permanent members. In their opinion, the new members will be inferior without the veto. The other view states that the enjoyment of the veto, as now constituted, by the new permanent members would entail setbacks. Therefore, to limit the veto in scope and application for the moment with a view 12 to its eventual abolishment is, in their view, necessary. In this connection, there have been many sensible suggestions to curtail the veto?s scope and application. They are very interesting indeed. The most sensible of them, in our view, is the idea of curtailing its application to issues that fall under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. In fact, the provisions of Chapter VII are the rationale of the Security Council. Myanmar has consistently held the view that the veto is unjust and anachronistic and that its ultimate elimination is the most logical conclusion. However, we accept that it is unrealistic to eliminate the veto at present. We therefore consider it unfair and discriminatory to deny the veto to new permanent members until we can seal the fate of this unwanted relic of the past. We strongly feel that new members should be endowed with the same rights and prerogatives now enjoyed by the current permanent members. I have dealt at some length with the United Nations reform process. I have done so because the effective functioning of the United Nations in fulfilling its role and objectives is of critical importance to developing countries like mine. It is here at the United Nations that developing countries have sovereign equality with big and powerful countries. It is here at the United Nations that we have to maintain and safeguard time-bound principles such as settling international disputes by peaceful means; refraining in international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State; and refraining from intervention in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State. These are principles that are of the utmost importance to developing countries like Myanmar so that they can have independence not only in name but also in reality. Only a United Nations that is genuinely democratic will ensure that these principles are neither diluted nor made flexible to serve the domestic political needs of big and powerful nations. In the age of a single super-Power, we are witnessing too often attempts to use the United Nations as a political tool of the big and powerful nations. Too often we are seeing the will of the international community become synonymous with that of the single most powerful nation or a group of powerful nations. Only a United Nations that is genuinely representative can look after not only the interest of big and powerful nations but also the interest of the whole United Nations membership, including the weakest among them. That is why we place so much importance on the United Nations reform process. We had high hopes that the end of the cold war would usher in a new international order. We had high hopes that resources used for the arms race could be diverted to development activities. We had hoped for peace and tranquillity to prevail worldwide. Instead we see instability and conflict in most regions of the world — the crisis in the Middle East, the tragedy in Bosnia, in Kosovo, in Angola, in the Sudan and in Afghanistan, to cite just a few. In many of these situations, the United Nations had to spend millions and millions of dollars in its peacekeeping efforts. This has caused a serious drain on the resources of the Organization, whose finances were already in dire circumstances mainly because of a single Member that had withheld its contributions for domestic political reasons. It would be a truism to say that the United Nations and its operations are overstretched. Much of its resources have been diverted from development activities, expenditures that could be put to more useful purposes for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples. In spite of this situation, there are those who would like to use the United Nations to interfere in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of Myanmar. The present Government assumed State responsibility to restore stability and normalcy to the country when it was in a state of chaos and anarchy. In the last few years the Government has restored stability to the country. The insurgency, which has burdened the country for the last 50 years, is now almost a thing of the past. Peace and tranquillity prevail throughout nearly the whole country. These are hard-earned achievements, especially for a multi-ethnic nation such as Myanmar. We have attained stability in Myanmar through our own endeavours. We have not imposed any burden on the international community. We are therefore very much distressed that there are those who would like to use the United Nations to intervene in matters that are essentially within our domestic jurisdiction. It was the General Assembly itself which adopted numerous resolutions, including the resolution on the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, which reaffirms the sovereign and inalienable right of each and every State to choose its economic and political systems. We in Myanmar have chosen the path of democracy. It is also an irony that at a time when Myanmar has openly and repeatedly declared that it is now in the 13 process of building a genuine democratic State with a market-oriented economic system, political pressure has been put on us by those who not only would like us to adopt democracy but would also like to transplant a democracy according to their own mould. It is unfortunate that these proponents of a particular type of democracy would like to use the United Nations to interfere in our domestic political process. We in Myanmar strongly believe that the path we have chosen is the right one and is the most suitable to our tradition, to our culture, to our national ethos and, most importantly, to the aspirations of our people. We shall resolutely continue our endeavours to build a modern, democratic, peaceful and prosperous nation in Myanmar. Nevertheless, there are some who entertain concerns that difficulties relating to human rights practices in one country could create economic problems in another. In fact, such transborder human movements occurred among neighbouring countries in the past for various reasons. The important aspect is that there must be the will to resolve and overcome such difficulties through mutual understanding and respect. The idea of relying on others to resolve our own domestic problems should be discouraged. We still live in an unsettled post-cold-war period where pockets of rising tensions still exist. We are also confronted with a vast array of major problems awaiting solutions. Since we last met, we have witnessed developments that give cause for hope as well as for deep concern. As the only multilateral forum to deal with the problems of peace and development, the enhanced role of the United Nations is now more necessary than ever. We all have trust in the Organization?s capability to avert catastrophes of all kinds and to find global solutions to the major problems of the world. We also have trust in our capacity to work together. It is imperative to redouble our concerted efforts if we are to be successful in the creation of a peaceful and prosperous world order. In this common task, Myanmar pledges, as a responsible Member of the United Nations, to continue its strong support for the endeavours of the Organization to promote the economic and social advancement of mankind and reaffirms its commitments to the purposes and principles of the Charter. This is my first General Assembly as Prime Minister. I was here as Foreign Minister, when the waves of change were sweeping away the cold-war era. I recall the optimism shared by many about a more humane and harmonious international system. I remember the sounds of joy as freedom, democracy and the market economy rang victorious on a global scale. Indeed, significant changes have taken place since then. New States have joined the family of nations. A broader and deeper commitment to contemporary values has taken root. The international climate long dictated by ideological divisions has withered away. At no time in recent history have nations become so close to each other around shared values. Yet this is not the full story. The late twentieth century is full of paradoxes and competing currents. For the fortunate among us, the world has never offered more — better education, better health care, greater prosperity. But these fruits are denied to the vast majority of the planet?s population. The number of people who live in dire poverty is growing. Admittedly, our overall security environment has improved. But the resurgence of aggression, extreme ethnic nationalism, tribalism, religious fundamentalism, racism, xenophobia and cultural discrimination pose new threats to international peace and stability. Cultural and religious intolerance is breeding more conflicts than ever before. International terrorism, openly sponsored by some States, has become a formidable threat to civilized societies. The interconnected groups that engage in terrorism, organized crime and drug-smuggling challenge our security and well-being. The threat of nuclear confrontation between the super-Powers has been eliminated; the danger of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction still looms on the horizon. The two contradictory trends in the world — one towards fragmentation and conflict, the other towards globalization and cooperation — require a careful and sober analysis. This new dialectic defines the framework in which we have to operate. The integrity of the nation State, and the demands of an even more interdependent world must be harmonized and balanced. The United Nations was our collective response to the challenges of the past. It was built on the ashes of the Second World War. The bitter experiences of that war left their imprint on the Charter, the rules that govern its work and its structure. To its credit, this Organization has helped bring peace, prosperity and hope to millions of people around the globe. Indeed, over a span of 53 years the United Nations has managed very complex humanitarian emergencies, from civil wars to the mass movement of refugees and health epidemics. For millions of people around the world, the United Nations is not a faceless institution. It is the difference between peace and war. It is food for those on the borderline of starvation and medicine to those on the brink of death. But, above all, the United Nations remains our hope for a better, peaceful and secure future. In this time of challenge and change, the United Nations is more important than ever. It is here at the United Nations that we must fight together against the forces of destruction. It is here that we must strive to strengthen democratic institutions, to further promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to punish those responsible for crimes against humanity. It is here that we must open the door to development for many nations trapped in poverty. Their misery is a 24 challenge to all of us. But, above all, the United Nations must promote justice so that peace may endure. As we stand at the threshold of a new millennium, it is our duty to chart a new course for the United Nations and set a common standard for the behaviour of nations. I suggest that we should focus greater effort on the following areas. The first is preventing conflicts in potential crisis areas. I believe there is no shortage of information on a brewing crisis. By the time a crisis is addressed at the United Nations, it has already taken on critical proportions and often reached a point of no return. Bosnia is the most tragic example. Regional organizations should play a more effective role in defusing tensions from their onset. Regional organizations and the United Nations should establish an effective mechanism for coordination and consultation. The second area is peace-building. We must devise a new approach to peace-building to provide lasting security. Even when a ceasefire is holding or elections have taken place, the social and institutional grounds appear to be very shaky. The United Nations must have both a programme and experts to help countries emerge from conflicts. The third area is sustainable development. If the United Nations is to maintain its credibility for its Members, it must enable people to lift themselves out of poverty. There must be more effective coordination between United Nations aid, international efforts and contributions from donor countries. Obviously, funding is a major concern, but a coordinated and streamlined strategy is equally important. The emphasis recently placed by the United Nations on the problems of Africa is an encouraging starting point. It should give direction to our efforts to eliminate poverty in all regions where we witness human misery. The fourth area is one standard for all. Despite all solemn declarations, international conventions and the legal framework, there seems to be no end in sight to discriminatory practices and double standards. The division of the world along religious, ethnic and cultural fault lines is an invitation to disaster. We must all ensure that no nation in the world feels discriminated against on the grounds of its cultural or religious identity. My final point pertains to the fight against terrorism. We have to eliminate this major threat to our citizens and nations. I share the views expressed by President Clinton. We have to place the combat against terrorism at the top of our agenda. There must be no excuses, no false justifications. The demands on the United Nations have grown enormously. We all agree that reform is vital. We support the Secretary-General in his substantive reforms. We believe that reform must be comprehensive. It must also include the reform of the Security Council. Piecemeal efforts and inadequate measures do not offer a solution. The representative character of the Security Council must be enhanced to meet the expectations of the largest segment of the United Nations membership. The Council must become more responsive and transparent. Reform must render this organ more accountable, effective and democratic, so that it can exercise authority and offer moral guidance. Turkish foreign policy is defined by a blend of our history, culture and geostrategic location at the crossroads of Asia and Europe. It corresponds to the aspirations of our people for peace, stability and prosperity. As a secular democratic country with a predominantly Muslim population, we combine our national heritage with a strong commitment to modernism. On all the issues and disputes that figure on the agenda of the international community, our policies are clear and consistent. We oppose aggression and believe that any breach of international law and legitimacy must not be condoned. We have always advocated the resolution of disputes through peaceful means and dialogue. Turkey has been an active actor in the efforts to contribute to the peaceful settlement of outstanding disputes. We participate extensively in peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations. We live in a region where there are major currents of instability and conflict. Indeed, almost every major issue that consumes the international community — from the Balkans to the Caucasus, from the Middle East to the Gulf — affects our security and well-being. Conscious of these challenges, we have assumed an important role in contributing to the efforts aimed at peacefully resolving conflicts and preserving security and stability. We are actively promoting regional peace through regional cooperation initiatives. Both the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and the Economic Cooperation Organization are cases in point. 25 The Balkan region is a test case with regard to the challenges we face in the post-cold-war era. It is here that we must prove that multicultural and multi-ethnic societies have a chance to live in peace and harmony. We thought that we had all drawn our bitter lessons from the tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We must never allow it to happen again. However, the recent violence in Kosovo is similar to what transpired in Bosnia and Herzegovina; it is of the same making, the result of the same mentality. Within the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Kosovo must regain its autonomous status in a manner that satisfies all the ethnic groups. Regional stability is a prerequisite for international peace. That is why we have taken a number of initiatives to resolve outstanding problems with some of our neighbours. A problem that has preoccupied Turkish- Bulgarian relations for almost half a century has recently been resolved successfully in good faith by the two countries. This achievement demonstrates vividly that even the most complex issues can be resolved if there is political will and courage on both sides. Several interrelated problems, mostly pertaining to the Aegean and inherited from the past, continue to mar Turkish-Greek relations. It is our ardent hope that these questions will be addressed between the two countries through a meaningful dialogue, without excluding any United Nations-agreed method of peaceful settlement. We call upon the Government of Greece to dedicate itself to a dialogue with Turkey. The question of Cyprus is at a critical juncture. The course pursued by Greece and the Greek Cypriots poses a serious threat to the security of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and of Turkey. It is also detrimental to peace and stability in the eastern Mediterranean. On the military front, the policies of the Greek/Greek Cypriot camp have heightened tensions on the island. The clock is ticking for the deployment of the S-300 missile system. On the political front, the decision of the European Union to start accession negotiations with the Greek Cypriot side has altered all the parameters and the established framework for a settlement. Regrettably, this process serves only to perpetuate the division of the island. Turkey fully supports the initiative tabled at this critical time by President Denktas¸ on 31 August 1998. This proposal of historic importance foresees the establishment of a Cyprus confederation. We believe this proposal provides a perspective for a just and lasting settlement. It corresponds to the realities of the island. It protects the vital and legitimate interests of all the parties concerned. It aims at preserving the integrity of the island. It is in line with the United Nations approach to reaching a freely negotiated and mutually acceptable settlement to the Cyprus issue. We believe that the proposed confederation can finally open an avenue for peace and reconciliation based on a common destiny for the two peoples in Cyprus. The impasse in the Middle East peace process and the continuing plight of the Palestinian people are a source of great concern for Turkey. An incomplete peace exposes the Middle East to the risks of further instability. It also dims the prospects for the people of the region to enjoy an economically and socially sound future. Turkey is a friend of the Arab nations. We share a common history and a rich cultural heritage. We value these strong bonds. Turkey is also a friend of Israel. We are, therefore, all the more concerned by the lack of progress in bringing a permanent state of peace and stability to the Middle East. In the same vein, we look forward to the reintegration into the international community of Iraq, with its territorial integrity intact, through the full implementation of the Security Council resolutions and the lifting of the sanctions. The crisis in Afghanistan also threatens peace and stability within the wider context of the region. The Afghan conflict can only be overcome through inter- Afghan dialogue and the establishment of a broad-based Government. The United Nations should have a central role in this regard. The overall situation in the Caucasus is a major destabilizing factor. It has a direct bearing on our security and well-being. We call for the urgent settlement of the Nagorny Karabakh dispute and the termination of the Armenian occupation of Azeri territory. The Armenian leadership must commit itself to the efforts of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. It is our sincere conviction that the interests of 26 the Armenian people will be better served by focusing on a peaceful future, rather than militancy. Peace and stability in the Caucasus also require the resolution of the Georgian/Abkhaz conflict, with full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia. Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia are our neighbours, with which we wish to work together for our common prosperity and security. At the threshold of a new millennium, our agenda for the twenty-first century must be inspired by the vision of the founding fathers. We must rededicate ourselves to the purposes and principles of the Charter. We must fulfil our pledge to succeeding generations. To this end, we must join our forces to maintain international peace and security. Turkey, for its part, is prepared to assume its share as an actor in the preservation of international peace, security and prosperity. In fact, I would like to take this opportunity to state from this rostrum that we are a serious contender for the Security Council in the year 2000. Turkey is eager to place its assets at the service of regional and global peace and stability as a member of the Council. The Charter is a contract among nations to combine our efforts to realize the aspirations and goals of the peoples of the world. It is high time that we fulfilled its terms. It is also time to build on the progress we have made for the cause of peace, security and prosperity of the global community. We must now give a new direction to our efforts. As the world turns a new leaf, let us rise to the occasion.  It gives me particular pleasure to congratulate Mr. Opertti most warmly on his election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. Please allow me also to join those who have expressed their appreciation for the work done by the former President, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, during the past session. Since this is the first time that I am taking the floor in this Assembly, I would like to express to Secretary-General Kofi Annan our highest consideration and support for his activity, especially for his efforts in promoting reform of and a new image for the United Nations. Romania believes that the role of the United Nations in contemporary international life remains essential, given that, in the face of the new challenges to international security, we can react in a coherent and efficient manner only under the guidance of a unique system of values, such as that of the generally accepted principles of the United Nations Charter, whose validity remains indisputable. My country desires to participate actively in the process of redefining the role of the United Nations and of modernizing its functioning, and it supports the reform of the Organization as a whole. The beneficial role of United Nations preventive diplomacy, demonstrated these past years, as well as the new approaches regarding humanitarian aid, peacekeeping and post-conflict reconstruction, are eloquent examples of the usefulness of joint, coordinated action at the global level. Romania is actively involved in promoting these concepts and trends and is participating, to the extent of its capacity, in peacekeeping and peace-building operations. The participation of Romanian soldiers in United Nations peacekeeping missions in Bosnia, Angola, Kuwait, Somalia or Rwanda represents our contribution to the implementation of these concepts. The political will of Romania to act as a factor of stability on the international level was proved once more yesterday when we signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations regarding stand-by arrangements. This event, furthermore, supplements the recent accession of Romania to the Multinational United Nations Standby Forces High-Readiness Brigade (SHIRBRIG). The experience acquired in peacekeeping operations has highlighted the need to consolidate United Nations rapid reaction capacity. Romania is profoundly concerned about the conflict situations on the agenda of the Security Council and would like to take this opportunity to advocate, once more, dialogue among the parties concerned, in order to facilitate solutions negotiated by those directly involved in the conflict. It is essential not to lose the momentum for dialogue likely to lead to peace, because there is always a right moment for peace, just as there is also sometimes, unfortunately, a time which can lead to conflict. For example, in our view the Middle East today is facing a unique chance for peace. If the parties involved do not take advantage of this opportunity, the crisis might continue indefinitely. Let us do our utmost to avoid an unfortunate “too late” situation. We were on the verge of acting too late in Bosnia, in Northern Ireland, and we still run this risk in Kosovo. The evolution of the crisis in Kosovo remains extremely worrying. Romania continues to stand for the peaceful settlement of this conflict, and we support the efforts of the international community in this direction, including those of the Contact Group, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe. Beyond all doubt, the countries in the region must be constantly consulted regarding measures that are to be taken for the settlement of the conflict. The Balkans and, in a broader sense, South-Eastern Europe have, inter alia, an image problem. The inventory of local disputes gets more attention than the inventory of real success stories. We forget that a number of these countries have managed to make the transition from dictatorships and centralized economies to democracies and market economies. It is a difficult process but one courageously undertaken by these countries. It is true that it is always up to them to improve their political image — not by falsifying it, but on the contrary by rendering it more exact. There is the need for a certain regional pride, for a legitimate aspiration to show the 14 world not only the spectre of intraregional conflicts, but also a promising economic and cultural potential that deserves every consideration and encouragement. Romania is particularly concerned about the still unresolved conflict situation in the eastern region of the Republic of Moldova. We believe that there are serious reasons for concern about the lack of progress in solving the two major problems of this region — namely, the withdrawal of foreign troops from the territory of the Republic of Moldova, and the negotiation of the political status of the eastern region of the Republic of Moldova. We support the need for the resumption of negotiations on the status of this region and the urgent implementation of the 1994 agreement on the withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army from the territory of the Republic of Moldova. We believe that the United Nations Security Council will continue to play a crucial role in the maintenance of international peace and security. We support the reform of the Council and want to have the discussions continued on equitable representation in the Council and an increase in its membership, with a view to finding generally acceptable solutions. Our approach is also aimed at obtaining an additional non-permanent seat for the Group of Eastern European States. In the context of increasingly diverse challenges to international security and the prevalence of non-military risks, the role of the United Nations in other fields — economic, social and legal — is becoming more important than ever. The economic and social dimensions of United Nations activities offer even more opportunities for a coherent and efficient management of dialogue and cooperation on global economic and social issues. The high-level dialogue which recently took place in New York on the economic and social impact of globalization re-emphasized the need for a coordinated approach to economic interdependence and other dimensions of international security. An effective response to the present challenges requires the participation of all States, as well as international financial and commercial institutions, in order to reach a new global financial balance. In a world of growing interdependence, the assistance provided by the United Nations system is a good example of the coordinated way in which we can address the various problems confronting us. Romania is developing effective cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Children?s Fund (UNICEF) and other funds and programmes within the new United Nations development assistance framework. The Romanian Government would like to benefit more from United Nations assistance in priority fields in support of domestic reforms. This year, the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights gives me this very pleasant opportunity to refer to the human dimension of our activity. It also provides us all with an opportunity to reflect more broadly upon the interdependencies which exist between human rights and peace, development and democracy. Romania supports the role played by the United Nations in asserting the universal nature of human rights and in consolidating the international system for the protection of these rights in collaboration with Governments and civil society. We also wish to contribute to an active and efficient United Nations involvement in the fight against terrorism, organized crime and illicit drug-trafficking. In this respect, we must take into account the fact that the global character of these new threats requires a global approach so that mankind can tackle them in a responsible way. We cannot afford the luxury of replacing effective action by endless debate or compassion by contemptuous judgement. We should condemn terrorism without speaking of terrorist peoples or countries. We should condemn fanaticism without claiming that there are fanatic religions or denominations. We should encourage dialogue and not confrontation, solidarity and not segregation. We have to work for the unity of Europe without instituting various degrees of “Europeanism”, which could lead to arbitrary divisions that separate and exclude rather than unite. We have to encourage the spirit of cooperation and mutual aid and not the tendency to pass judgement on others. We should not judge States for the undignified deeds of certain citizens, nor peoples for the historic accidents imposed on them by abusive leaders or barbarian ideologies. We should also refrain from condemning those who have different views from ours and should not use the name of democracy to encourage confusion between public affairs and private, between the values of pomp and sincerity, between honesty and demagogy. We should 15 not add to the confusion of the world by an ostentatious relativization of acquired traditions and values. In this context, Romania reaffirms its attachment to the concepts of multiculturalism and tolerance of all kinds. Allow me to recall that an international conference organized by the community of Sant?Egidio was recently held in Bucharest on the topic of peoples and religions. Representatives of all the major religions and denominations of the world participated in this meeting. As mentioned in the message of Pope John Paul II, the success of the meeting testified to Romania?s mission as “an interface between East and West, offering a genuine synthesis of cultures and traditions”. At present, many countries of the world are undergoing the complex and unique experience of regaining democracy. That is why there is great interest in good governance, strengthening democratic institutions and enlarging the participation of civil society in the exercise of democracy. It gives me great pleasure, in my capacity as Acting Chairman of the Third International Conference of New or Restored Democracies, to bring to the Assembly?s attention the fact that the ministerial meeting of the countries participating in that Conference took place a few days ago here at United Nations headquarters. On that occasion, a number of measures were examined concerning the implementation of the recommendations formulated in the document adopted last year in Bucharest. In this respect, we intend to present a draft resolution to the General Assembly with a view to ensuring the follow-up to this process until the next Conference. Romania highly appreciates the framework provided by the United Nations system, since it allows for the broad participation of all countries in all fields and enables the search for common interests that transcend national pride. Please allow me to raise a few issues relating to Romania, a country engaged in the broad and difficult process of economic reform. For us, maintaining an international environment that is stable, predictable and stimulating to business and investment is central to fulfilling our economic reform programme. Romania?s fundamental option — that of European reintegration and membership in NATO — is well known. Our political objectives remain unchanged. Even if the rate at which these objectives are achieved varies from one country to another, we have no alternative. As we strive to replace one system by another, we are encountering all the difficulties of transition: low standards of living, the confusion of values, a radical change of mentalities against the backdrop of social and administrative inertia. Everything has become a priority. Everything is compulsory. Everything is urgent. This is why I feel we need the support and encouragement of the international community, to the benefit of democratization and development. With regard to subregional cooperation, our experience shows that crisis situations are generally seen solely from the political, military and sometimes humanitarian perspectives, but rarely or never from those of economics or civil society. Certainly, there are well- targeted subregional projects, such as the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and those relating to transport routes linking the Caspian Sea to Western Europe, the ancient silk route. But we have to recognize that South- Eastern Europe lacks broad economic integrating projects that are assisted by the main international institutions. In the absence of such economic cooperation projects, our policy is somewhat reactive. We also have to recognize that, in crisis situations, we still focus on effects and not on causes; we try to limit the damage and prevent the spread of the crisis, but do not focus on the prevention of conflict itself. In our opinion, we should take better advantage of the framework provided by the United Nations system in order to work out development-oriented political strategies, in particular in the economic field. Similar developments — leading, on the one hand, to solidarity and, on the other, to an ever greater diversity of the problems that confront us — can also be noted in other regions of the world, not only in the Euro-Atlantic space. We have followed them attentively and appreciate the results obtained within the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Southern Cone Common Market, the Association of South-East Asian Nations and other organizations. Among the priorities established by Romania, it is worth mentioning the objective of developing and diversifying our political and economic relations with countries of other regions, taking into account the complex and dynamic developments of an ever more interdependent world under the impact of globalization. In conclusion, allow me to assure the Assembly of the commitment of the Romanian delegation to 16 contributing effectively to United Nations activities in various fields towards the successful outcome of the current session. We believe in the capacity of the United Nations to tackle the complex problems facing the international community on the eve of the third millennium. On behalf of the delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, I extend my warmest congratulations to Mr. Didier Opertti on his election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. His acumen, scholarship and leadership skills are well known in our region through his distinguished participation in various high-level hemispheric forums over the years. I also wish to express my delegation?s sincere appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of the Ukraine, who presided over the work of the fifty- second session with great distinction. Our esteemed Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, has continued to provide outstanding leadership in the discharge of his duties. My delegation commends the Secretary-General for his reform initiatives designed to make the United Nations a more efficient organization, capable of responding to the many challenges it faces, and for his untiring efforts in the pursuit of world peace and security, long-lasting prosperity and international cooperation. Our own University of the West Indies, acting on behalf of the region, has honoured him appropriately for his work in this regard. Since the signing of the Charter some 53 years ago, the world can celebrate numerous progressive changes in which the United Nations has played a significant part. United Nations peacekeepers have been instrumental in preserving peace and stability in troubled areas of the globe, and the Organization?s humanitarian missions have been effective in alleviating suffering among many people throughout the world. At the same time, there remains a massive gap between aspiration and accomplishment. Despite the unprecedented prosperity that technological advances and the globalization of production and finance have brought to many countries, especially in the developed world, the majority of mankind is yet under the yoke of persistent poverty. The eradication of poverty remains a priority for developing countries. The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is committed to the uplifting of the lot of the poor and disadvantaged sections of our society. In this regard, my Government?s specific policy and 17 programme objectives over the medium and long term are designed to promote sustained economic growth and development in ways that expand employment, raise incomes, improve living standards, increase productive capacity and reduce poverty. We therefore call for the creation of a supportive international environment. We also call on the developed countries to fulfil the commitments undertaken for the provision of additional financial resources in combating world poverty, that social malignancy which is seminal many of the other problems that plague developing countries. It would be remiss of me not to take this opportunity to thank the European Union for its unwavering support and most recent decision on the banana regime for African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, within the framework of the Lomé Convention on economic cooperation, trade and development. The new arrangements are compatible with the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO), and will allow this important regional industry to achieve a sustainable level of growth. These new arrangements also create an appropriate environment for the survival of a restructured and competitive banana industry. It is therefore quite alarming to learn that the United States of America and some of our hemispheric friends in Latin America are about to challenge the new arrangements. Such actions force us to revisit the Charters of regional and international organizations of which we are a part and question the efficaciousness of our membership. These incomprehensible stratagems on the part of friendly countries nurture a pervasive cynicism among our peoples, who chastise Governments for cooperating with those who say one thing and then act in a totally contrary manner that is injurious to our best interests. My delegation is amazed by the blind and apathetic position of the United States of America on the issue. We are told that no harm is meant to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and other Caribbean banana-producing countries, while efforts are made to undermine our social stability, which is facilitated by the export of our bananas under the provisions of the Lomé Convention. How can we convince our citizens of the need to combat the production, use and trade in illicit drugs if our banana industry is destroyed? Is it really possible that our friends, especially the United States, want to see the proliferation of instability, insecurity and extreme poverty in a region which has made steady socio-economic progress since the widespread social turbulence of the 1930s? In spite of the special difficulties faced by small island developing countries like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, we are meeting all our international obligations and have acceded to several bilateral and multilateral programmes on the eradication of illicit drugs. We have the will to fight this scourge in the international community, but friendly nations should also understand our vulnerabilities. My Government is scrupulously committed to the defense and enhancement of the democratic process which has emerged in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and other countries of the Caribbean Community since the mid-1940s with the attainment of universal adult suffrage. Our democracies are based on respect for human rights, on recognition, in policy and practice, that the distribution of national resources is disparate and that all our people aspire to a decent standard of living, on the creation of economic and other opportunities for personal development and on the observance of free and fair elections under our Constitution. After the fourth consecutive election victory of 15 June 1998, the New Democratic Party (NDP) Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, under the pragmatic and visionary leadership of the Rt. Honourable Sir James F. Mitchell, reiterates its commitment to these principles, as we join with the international community in building a better life for our people in the twenty-first century. My delegation strongly condemns the recent acts of terrorism which occurred in Kenya, Tanzania, Northern Ireland and Cape Town, South Africa. Violence should never be the way to settle disputes. The deaths of so many innocent people in such outrageous acts can never be justified. My delegation therefore urges that all parties involved must review their policies, settle their disputes peacefully and use reason instead of the bomb. My Government fully supports the Good Friday Agreement brokered by the United States in Northern Ireland. It provides an acceptable framework for the resolution of deep-seated, historic differences in that part of the world. My delegation is very concerned about the illicit transfer and proliferation of small arms and light weapons and their accumulation in many countries. These activities constitute a real threat to national and regional security and can contribute to the destabilization of States. We 18 urge Member States to cooperate in taking steps to deal effectively with this increasing problem. My country was pleased to sign the Inter-American Convention Against the Illicit Production and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Materials, at the Organization of American States in November 1997. My Government wishes to express its appreciation for the adoption in 1996, by the Disarmament Commission, of guidelines in resolution 46/36 H of 6 December 1991. However, we feel that there is need for greater urgency in advancing initiatives to deal with this issue at a global level. The end of the cold war rekindled aspirations for lasting peace and prosperity. The dismantling of the Berlin Wall heightened expectations for a peace dividend. Unfortunately, the United Nations has to continue utilizing most of its resources in managing or containing conflicts of varying origins and intensity in many parts of the world. The role of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security has become even more relevant than before. The situations in Angola, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Great Lakes region, the Western Sahara and the Middle East, among many others countries, continue to occupy the attention of this Organization. We are dismayed that, in spite of the end of cold-war rivalry, the unfortunate people of Cyprus must continue to accommodate the division imposed on their country. As we approach the new millennium, our world is still threatened by the existence of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction and the potential for their further proliferation. The time has come for all countries to commit themselves to the goal of complete eradication of weapons of mass destruction. I call for universal support for the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. The Convention is clear on the total ban on anti-personnel mines, which have taken the lives of so many innocent civilians, mostly women and children. In the nation-States of the Caribbean Community, the dawn of a new millennium challenges us to assert our independence and demonstrate our maturity by crafting creative constitutional arrangements, suited to our particular historical, cultural and political evolution. We have come thus far with constitutions moulded for us by colonial masters. In the era of independence, we have experienced the shortcomings of these original instruments. Many of our sister countries have already embarked on this mission, and the Government and people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are beginning the process of forging a new constitution for the governance of the country in the twenty-first century. As we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Year for Human Rights, we call on Member States to remember the rights of the 21 million people in Taiwan. The Republic of China on Taiwan, both prosperous and democratic, deserves to be readmitted as a member of the United Nations, even as it pursues the goal of reunification. It is necessary that the United Nations provide the forum for discussion that will provide the framework for the peaceful reunification of both sides of the Taiwan Strait. My delegation congratulates the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), for its recent success in obtaining additional rights and privileges, such as the right to participate in the debate of the General Assembly and the right of reply. We hope that this new status will serve to enhance, rather than adversely affect, the peace talks between the PLO and Israel. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines strongly supports the Middle East peace process and the negotiations which seek the full implementation of the Oslo accords. With the changing world environment, the Organization has assumed new prominence, and there is renewed hope and high expectations for, as well as new ideas on, the functioning of the General Assembly and, in particular, the reform of the Security Council. Let us not lose momentum in our common quest to give new life to this Organization. We repeat our call, made during the Assembly?s fifty-second session, for an increase in both the permanent and non-permanent membership of the Security Council. Japan and Germany deserve their seats as permanent members, but Latin American and the Caribbean, Africa and Asia must be given permanent seats, which should be rotated among aspiring countries in those regions. There has been much debate on whether new permanent members should have the same rights as the old permanent members. There must be no discrimination, and no two classes of permanent members. As regards the veto currently held by permanent members, in the opinion of my delegation, it is time for its abolition. We must be guided by the key word, “democracy”, as we move to reform the United Nations. 19 As a member of the Alliance of Small Island States, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines fully supports initiatives to protect the environment. The effects of global warming are of grave concern to small islands like ours, whose coastal areas may become submerged, and whose protective coral reefs are at risk of total destruction. Meteorologists tell us that July 1998 was the hottest month since reliable records have been kept. We in the Caribbean can hardly doubt this, given the exceptional heat wave and humidity which we have experienced this year. Our region also continues to be battered by more frequent and stronger hurricanes, as evidenced this year again. Hurricane Georges has devastated several islands in the Caribbean, leaving over 300 dead and hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to infrastructure, homes and utilities in its wake. The Gulf coast of the United States mainland has also suffered from the effects of that hurricane, providing us with a stark reminder that the forces of nature respect no borders. I take this opportunity to extend condolences and solidarity to all those who have lost relatives and loved ones, and to the Governments of the affected countries. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, with its limited resources, has already embarked on a programme of assistance to our sister countries in the Caribbean, where we know that each one of us is our brother?s keeper. The ecologically vulnerable islands and low-lying coastal States of the Caribbean are subject to all the acute consequences of urbanization and resource exploitation. We are exposed to the danger of waste being dumped in our seas and a rise in sea level as well as other effects of climate change. There must be a strong commitment to the reduction in greenhouse emissions. We must carry the momentum to combat climate change well into the twenty- first century in order to reduce the danger posed to our States. The issue of the sustainable development of small island developing States involves much more than beaches and coral reefs. It is about the existence of effective partnerships between peoples and Governments, and between developed and developing countries. It is against this backdrop that we look forward to the special session to review the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, which is scheduled for 1999. We expect the review to result in concrete and practical outcomes, and to foster the requisite political commitment to the process. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is a small but beautiful plural country, striving to maintain its agricultural, tourism and other service industries in this era of globalization. We, like so many developing countries today, suffer from the problems related to unemployment. We will continue to identify new and non-traditional areas, such as informatics and financial services, in order to create opportunities for our people, particularly our youth. We must express concern about Draconian immigration laws and regulations being adopted by an increasing number of countries. As a region where emigration has been of historic importance, the Caribbean could be severely affected by these restrictions. These stringent immigration policies have led to massive and summary deportations of immigrants from our region and other developing countries. Some people face dehumanizing abuse and death as they try to escape from poverty by seeking refuge in more developed countries. I need not emphasize how serious a threat these actions pose to the social and economic well-being of the peoples of the Caribbean region. The United Nations stands at the threshold of a new millennium. We pray that it continues to perform its rightful role in addressing the many issues that occupy us in our everyday lives. We believe that the reforms that we all desire will build on progress already made in areas of international cooperation. Let us work together and give meaning to our Charter, to save succeeding generations from the scourges of war, poverty and hunger. Let us reaffirm our faith in fundamental human rights, the dignity and worth of the human person and particularly the equal rights of man and woman, and of nations large and small. I would first like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session, Mr. Didier Opertti, of Uruguay, and to give him Andorra?s unconditional support during this year of reforms. I would also like to thank the outgoing President, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his important contribution to the debates of the fifty-second General Assembly. 22 We are now celebrating the fifth anniversary of the admission of Andorra into the United Nations. It is therefore fitting to begin my speech today with an assessment of what motivated Andorra?s entry into the United Nations and the tasks that its Government has accomplished. Andorra wanted to become a part of the Organization in 1993, immediately following approval by the Andorran people of a modern Constitution that affirmed its sovereignty and brought to modern times thirteenth- century texts, texts which had guaranteed independence and neutrality for more than seven centuries. Andorra?s international standing required it. Nevertheless, neutrality has never signified for Andorra isolation or a lack of self-determination. To the contrary, during times of great European conflicts, and during the Spanish civil war, Andorra opened its doors to those who fled terror and violence. Being a sanctuary of peace for so long has given Andorra certain international responsibilities, enumerated in the new Constitution of 1993, which says that the Andorran people shall persevere in the advancement of values such as justice, democracy and social progress, and keep and strengthen the harmonious relations of Andorra with the rest of the world, based on mutual respect, coexistence and peace in the desire to bring its strength and collaboration to all the common causes of mankind. The entry of Andorra into the United Nations has been a most important step for our country, giving us the opportunity to make ourselves heard, to express ourselves and to be a part of the forum which includes all countries; we must respond with solidarity, aid and our best efforts to attain peace, liberty and full adhesion to the International Declaration of Human Rights. I am speaking in Catalan, the language of Andorra. It is an old Latinate language, an important part of our cultural identity, and it is an honour to speak these words in this language to the Assembly today. It is also proof of one of the most difficult rights to assume: the right of difference. In Andorra, protected by the Pyrénées mountains, we are proud of our 720 years of uninterrupted peace and self- government. We have a population of over 65,000, composed of more than 60 nationalities. We have acquired, with the passage of time, certain experience in conjugating the verb “to tolerate”, because of the diversity of our population, of which “Andorrans” are a minority, the importance of immigration and the plurality of nationalities, cultures and languages. These are facts, which conform to modern societies. Permit me to expand on certain aspects of our country in order to emphasize our desire to cooperate in shared projects and to struggle against aggression and repression, and for harmony between peoples, cultures and civilizations. The particular sentiment that our little country feels before this Assembly is appreciation of the difference between globalization and particularity, the paradox between material progress and world poverty. Our confidence in this Assembly is absolute, and I shall give two reasons. First, we consider here the grand strategies we can adopt to pursue justice, democracy and the rule of law. Secondly, this Assembly is a common house, where all are equal under the law and all States can express their concerns to the world in an international assembly. The politics of Andorra at the United Nations inspire me to make a general reflection within this institution. In the last few years, the directives of the Government of Andorra concerning United Nations reform have been very clear: absolute adherence to the reform projects of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who, since his election, has worked to achieve the restructuring of this Organization. I am pleased to say that Mr. Annan is aided in seeking to attain his goals by the Deputy Secretary- General, who has helped him bring about his objectives, and I would like to congratulate Mrs. Louise Fréchette, who, in the months since she assumed her position, has helped immensely in the difficult task of reforming this institution, employing all the skills of a person of her diplomatic abilities. With respect to the reform of the United Nations, Andorra has shown a desire for transparency and greater access for the General Assembly to the workings of the Security Council. We would also like to make clear our desire for an increase in the membership of the Security Council, to reflect the increasing membership of the United Nations. The Working Group on the reform of the Council will sponsor debates and present alternatives, and we will present our ideas. The most important theme of my speech today is the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Andorra has strengthened its political structures in the light, always brilliant of that 23 1948 Declaration, which indeed, is given form in our Constitution. Article 5 of this document incorporates it into the judicial structure of the State in the phrase: “The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is binding in Andorra.” This Declaration, shared by so many States, should not be seen as Utopian. The proliferation of publications and seminars concerning the analysis and investigation of human rights, understood more and more as a means of ensuring a proper relationship between the individual, the community and the environment, touch on the grand systems of classic thought. The practice is deceptive. At the international level, none of us can ignore the paradox of great wealth contrasted with the abuse, the aggression and the most sinister forms of cruelty without limits. Today we know much of what happens in the world and very probably many of us know why. We cannot now return to ignorance, to lack of knowledge, to lies. In a more immediate framework, we cannot argue that things are getting better. How can we respect the individual and his fundamental rights if the proliferation of armed conflicts, racism, xenophobia and the marginalization of others continues? Tolerance and respect are not new terms, but they are key concepts, which must be reinvented or rediscovered, given a greater significance and a universal application. Too often tolerance is confused with condescension, and respect with bureaucratic formality. The danger increases when we become blinded by absolute truths and dogmatic positions which, in one way or another, lead to authoritarianism and exclusion, which are precisely the opposite of toleration and pluralism. This is written in the third book of the Pentateuch, Leviticus: “Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself”. (The Holy Bible, Leviticus 19:18) These are old and perennial moral statements, which shape society, and which have always been universal values incorporated in all the great statements on human rights. On 10 December we will celebrate the passing of 50 years since the signing of the Declaration. It has become a banner of this body, and it gives it reason to exist and to work. There remain much work to be accomplished and much evil to be fought. We are far from any moment of satisfaction. This century, which is about to end, contains few events of which we can reflect with satisfaction. The world has witnessed campaigns of extermination, holocausts and wars. It has all been extremely cruel and bloody. We can still see this black light in countries where assassinations take place under the guise of redressing religious grievances. Many other examples can be cited to show that the universal application of human rights has not been achieved, and we feel the same sense of powerlessness when we see our friends and neighbours in the Mediterranean dying on the southern borders of Europe. Those who survive are lifted out of the opulence of Europe and deported, after false hopes and impossible dreams, back to the misery of their places of origin. This also occurs, among other places, on the Adriatic coast. The Mediterranean is no longer the unifying sea that it once was. Rather it has been transformed into a barrier between the rich North, with its aging populations, and a South that, like Prometheus, is filled with misery — but also with young and struggling people more than half of whom are under 18. Can we not say, therefore, that a conflict is in the air? How far we have come from the stirring poem of Emma Lazarus, which, engraved on the base of the Statue of Liberty, welcomed, with a door open to hope, the persecuted and the refugee. Will the justice system become a mere spectacle? Even great dignitaries of great democracies, elected in a clear-cut way, are denied strict respect for personal and family privacy. The death penalty is still in effect in many countries. Child labour, child pornography, sex crimes, abuse and mistreatment are everyday occurrences. Fifty years of universal human rights mean that we have rules by which to differentiate between good and evil, and a standard by which we can recognize the often inconceivably evil actions of those individuals or States who live without letting others live. Now, since 1948, we cannot turn away: we know who respects and who does not respect human rights. 24 The 1998 report of Amnesty International is once again the faithful portrait of a planet which is capable of immense technological progress and scientific advances that we can scarcely imagine, a planet with the ambition to conquer interstellar space, but nevertheless continues to be a world of terrible crimes. I do not believe that this should be an anniversary during which we offer only congratulations; we should also reflect critically on how we might effectively achieve respect for human rights. It is obvious that all of us here today have a clear understanding of the universality of human dignity: it is the most fundamental and absolute of rights. We possess faith in the human being as the means of political action and the giver of concrete meaning to personal liberty and the freedom of societies. Democracy is a synonym for ironclad respect for human rights, without concessions, as the greatest guarantee of liberty and progress. What excuse could exist today for defending the notion that people do not have the capacity to elect public officials and to send them home through regular elections when those people believe that the politicians have not done well enough? It is clear that democracy is vulnerable when there is no sincere consensus on the rules of the game, and that this will lead directly to totalitarianism, corruption and manipulation. Globalization is not only an economic phenomenon: with globalization, people have seen large States flower with democracy, and have seen that oppressive and authoritarian regimes do not lead to lasting economic success, as some have claimed. Many institutions have made excuses for sins committed 500, 100, or 50 years ago. Must we wait half a century to apologize for the barbarous acts we commit today? We all bear responsibility. We should not respond only with words and good intentions, especially if we declare ourselves to be powerless before injustice and misery. Action by States will be the only acceptable response, for even if every citizen of the world could cooperate, we would still require force and the necessary instruments. What can Andorra, a small State, bring to this world body? Since 1993, my country has made a great legislative effort to accede to a large number of conventions, which permits us to participate in the rule of international law. From the point of view of security, Andorra desires to accede promptly to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, with international solidarity as our goal. Our humanitarian tradition made us one of the first countries to have ratified the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. In the domain of international law, our presence at Rome during the negotiation of the treaty on an International Criminal Court was marked by active participation in the writing of the text, notably the first paragraph of the statute. I would like to thank all delegations who helped with the Andorran contribution, and particularly the United States of America. Turning to international human rights legislation, we have over the years endorsed many human rights provisions. Andorra will accede to the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which includes the abolition of the death penalty. We are also a party to the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. At the United Nations, we give priority to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. I have the pleasure today to announce that I have taken the necessary steps to accede to other human rights instruments of which the Secretary-General is the depositary, in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. We are concerned too about universal problems such as terrorism, which must be combated without concession, and illicit drug trafficking and the associated money- laundering, which must be prosecuted relentlessly. International cooperation and mutual assistance are the proper tools for this fight. From a financial point of view, our per capita contribution is substantial, and we shall continue to contribute to United Nations funds relating to human rights, development and peacekeeping. In the field of preventive diplomacy, I insist on the importance of words and diplomatic relations in moving the world forward, and on the implementation of the memorandum of understanding successfully negotiated by the Secretary-General last February on weapons 25 inspections in Iraq; our Ambassador is a member of the Special Group on Iraq?s presidential sites. I believe that small countries without enemies or historical conflicts are in a favourable position to conduct discreet diplomacy and to play a mediation role to help ensure that important negotiations stay on track. In five years on the international stage, Andorra has found its place in the concert of nations, and we are very proud to belong to this Organization. At the United Nations, we have learned much from excellent teachers about how to go from the realm of the national to the international and from there to the universal. Andorra affirms before you its belief in human rights, at the same time as we stand for world security, peace and preventive diplomacy. During the fifty-third session of the General Assembly, Andorra will maintain this position and will work to participate in the reform of this international Organization, for now is the moment, at the beginning of the new millennium, to reinvigorate the United Nations, to make it a more effective instrument of order on this increasingly globalized planet. Today no one is innocent; we all share the same responsibilities. We wish to participate actively with all the Members in tackling the task of building for a better age in an imperfect world in which all the peoples of the world are increasingly interdependent and increasingly demand, with greater determination and courage, the universal application of human rights.  I would like to begin by congratulating the President on his unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. I am confident that under his able leadership and with his vast diplomatic experience, we shall have fruitful deliberations and a successful session. Allow me also to pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for the skill and sensitivity he displayed while presiding over the work of the General Assembly during its fifty-second session. May I also take this opportunity to commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his untiring efforts to build a prosperous United Nations through the ongoing reforms to better meet the challenges of the next millennium. Although adjustment and reorientation can sometimes be painful, I am confident that under Mr. Annan's leadership the United Nations will continue to flourish. Kenya supports the Secretary-General in these efforts. The General Assembly provides Member States with an opportunity to discuss and gain useful insights and perceptions on key global issues of common concern to the international community, such as securing a stable, 32 peaceful and equitable world order. In this context, we continue to witness the presence of the United Nations in peacekeeping and peace-building, development programmes and humanitarian assistance in Africa, Europe, Asia and the Americas. In our own region, for example, I wish to mention the good work of the Nairobi-based Great Lakes Programme, which operates under the auspices of the United Nations Great Lakes Task Force on Relief, Reconstruction and Development. This Programme is funded by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and contributes immensely to identifying the development priorities of the Great Lakes countries as they endeavour to make a transition from conflict to development. Furthermore, Kenya appreciates the timely response by the United Nations Disaster Management Team to drought and the floods caused by El Niño. In addition, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), with the support of the World Food Programme (WFP), continues to look after the needs of refugees in our country. All these efforts by United Nations agencies are commendable and need to be encouraged and sustained. In the last 10 years, we have witnessed significant advances in democracy, respect for human rights and international cooperation. Unfortunately, this was also a period in which an estimated 4 million people were killed in armed conflicts. A majority of these conflicts, which now threaten international peace and security, are of an intra-State rather than inter-State nature. Currently, there are up to 30 civil wars and a much larger number of lower- intensity conflicts being fought around the world. This new pattern of conflicts comes with new problems and new challenges for conflict resolution. There is a need, therefore, to review the existing conflict resolution mechanisms so as to meet these new challenges. As the Secretary-General?s Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict pointed out to the Security Council in June this year, “Both international and national actors need to take political, economic and social measures that can generate within communities a sense of hope in place of despair, a sense of inclusion and participation instead of exclusion, a sense of belonging instead of alienation”. (S/PV.3896, p. 5) The credibility of the international community is anchored in its ability to dispense just and sometimes radical solutions to important questions. I have in mind the commendable resolve of the world community to punish the perpetrators of war crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law. In this connection, Kenya welcomes the work of the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, as well as the International Criminal Court, which shall soon become a reality. The international community must demonstrate its resolve to pursue such criminal elements whoever and wherever they are. Kenya supports the legitimization and strengthening of regional bodies in peacekeeping. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), under the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in West Africa, stand out as examples of regional organizations that have contributed immensely to peacekeeping in conflict situations. I should also underline the commendable role played by the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in the conflicts in Croatia; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Albania; Abkhazia, Georgia; and currently in the Kosovo region of Yugoslavia. In Africa, the forces of the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) reinstalled the democratically elected Government of President Kabbah of Sierra Leone and restored constitutional order in Liberia. The superb performance of the Inter-African Mission to Monitor the Implementation of the Bangui Agreements (MISAB) in the Central African Republic also deserves commendation. In the Eastern African region, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) continues to promote political dialogue between the warring factions in the Sudan and Somalia. In southern Africa, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) has embarked on initiatives to address, inter alia, the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. These regional organizations have made significant progress in conflict resolution and should be given due recognition and the necessary support. However, I would like to emphasize that the responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security remains primarily with the United Nations Security Council. The holding of special meetings on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa underscored the need for a concerted international effort to promote peace and security in our continent. During the special meeting on Africa held in September 1997 and the follow-up meeting of 24 September 1998, the Security Council observed that, despite the progress achieved by some African 33 States, the number and intensity of armed conflicts on the continent remained a matter of grave concern. We share the view of the Secretary-General that durable peace and economic development go hand in hand. Kenya welcomes the challenge posed by the Secretary-General in the three broad areas he emphasized in his report: the necessity for Africa to rely on political rather than military responses to problems; the need to summon the political will to seriously promote good governance, human rights and democracy; and, finally, the necessity to undertake and adhere to various reforms necessary to promote political stability and economic growth. While the general tendency is to seek ways of deepening political cooperation and economic integration, the unity and stability of some States, especially on the African continent, is being threatened by ethnic, social and other intra-State conflicts. In particular, conflicts in the Great Lakes region, Somalia and southern Sudan — and, more recently, the inter-State conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea — are of major concern to us. Kenya has been and will continue to be involved in efforts aimed at reducing tension in Africa and, indeed, beyond. In 1996 and 1997, Kenya hosted the various Nairobi summits on the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and, indeed, the conflict in the southern Sudan, under the auspices of IGAD. More recently, President Moi met separately with the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea in an effort to secure their commitment to pursuing negotiations rather than war in their border dispute. These efforts have helped to complement the important initiatives of the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity and others and have, in our view, contributed to ensuring the avoidance of a full-scale war between Ethiopia and Eritrea. I trust the necessary goodwill exists for a negotiated final settlement in this conflict. Regarding Somalia, we are concerned about the lack of progress in the efforts to restore normalcy and statehood to that country. Both the IGAD and the Cairo initiatives have stalled. However, the cessation of hostilities; the agreement by the warring factions in Mogadishu to have a joint administration for the hitherto divided city; and the reopening of the harbour and airport are encouraging. It is our hope that the parties concerned will resume serious dialogue sooner rather than later. In June this year, the Security Council held an open debate on children and armed conflict. This is a matter of particular interest to Africa, where there are horrifying accounts of atrocities to which children are subject or in which they participate. We are painfully aware of the disturbing new phenomenon of “armed labour” in some parts of Africa and are therefore concerned about the possibility that children could be involved in these activities. There is the added dimension of the easy availability of illegal small arms which, as pointed out last week by Foreign Minister Jozias van Aartsen of the Netherlands, have the potential of destabilizing the whole region. Children are our future and all should continue to support the work of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to safeguard and protect them in areas of armed conflict. To that end, my delegation reiterates the need for strict compliance by all Member States with the relevant provisions of international law. Kenya believes that the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was a crucial step in the fulfilment of one of the main objectives in the implementation of relevant obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We believe that our common objective should lead to complete nuclear disarmament by the nuclear-weapon States. It is regrettable that the perceived lack of serious commitment by nuclear-weapon States to moving rapidly towards genuine disarmament recently provided an excuse for others to conduct nuclear tests. There is therefore a need for security assurances from non-nuclear-weapon States and, even more importantly, for urgent measures and renewed efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons. We expect the nuclear-weapon States to take their responsibilities seriously by seizing the initiative towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons from our planet. The process of development during the past decade has been uneven. A number of developing countries recorded high rates of growth and have been able to accelerate development. However, many of the developing countries, especially those in Africa, have made modest progress. The disparities in economic growth among developing countries have largely widened. These conditions have taken place against a backdrop of rapid changes in the world economy, characterized by the twin processes of globalization and liberalization, which have become the hallmark of global economic policy. The preferential treatment enjoyed by a large number of developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences and other preferential trading arrangements, such as the Lomé Convention, continues to be eroded. 34 It is imperative for the international community to strengthen commodity-dependent countries by means of expanded market access for their products, as well as support in the development of their technical and human capacities so that they may actively participate in the multilateral trading system. In this regard, my delegation would like to urge the effective implementation of the Uruguay Round results, especially with regard to market access for goods and services of export interest to developing countries. Developing countries, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa, have, during the past decade, undertaken many efforts aimed at attracting foreign direct investment. Unfortunately, these efforts have not yielded any significant inflows. International capital flows play an important role in the process of development. Kenya reiterates the need for increased access to international financial markets for the acquisition of finance on concessionary terms by developing countries. In this context, Kenya attaches great importance to the convening of an international conference on financing for development under the auspices of the United Nations. The liberalization of financial transactions and the increasing freedom of capital mobility have become important policy objectives for many countries. The resultant need to grapple with massive international capital flows, coupled with the experiences of financial turbulence and turmoil in some Asian economies, has highlighted the need to reform the international financial system. On the Asian financial crisis, my delegation wishes to advocate measures aimed at the restoration of stability in the affected countries to avoid serious negative consequences around the globe. The external debt problem of low-income developing countries, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa, remains unresolved. The international community is called upon to take actions aimed at finding lasting solutions to the debt problem. On official bilateral debt, while we are gratified at the adoption of the Naples terms by the Paris Club, the slow pace of their implementation continues to be of concern. Kenya wishes to urge the Paris Club of creditor countries to revise the eligibility criteria so as to allow for the inclusion of all low-income developing countries. The problem of multilateral debt also needs to be accorded serious attention, taking into account issues such as increased concessional finance, debt cancellation, debt reduction and debt relief. My delegation would like to express concern over the declining trend in real terms of official development assistance over the years. In this regard, Kenya wishes to call for the expeditious reversal of this trend by donor countries in line with their commitments in various United Nations resolutions and with the aim of meeting the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product. The interdependence of the global economy makes it necessary for those of us in the developing world to call upon the international community, including the United Nations agencies, international financial institutions and multilateral and bilateral donors, to support the implementation of strategies for the development of the developing countries and to give priority to financing for development and expansion of trade in those countries through mobilization of new and additional resources. Kenya welcomes the appointment of Mr. Klaus Töpfer as Director-General of the United Nations Office at Nairobi and the elevation of the Nairobi centre to the level of other United Nations centres at Vienna and Geneva. As the United Nations proceeds with reform measures to ensure the efficient use of resources, it is imperative for the Organization to ensure maximal and rational use of existing facilities within the system to minimize waste. As host to the only United Nations centre in the developing world, we are concerned that facilities at the Nairobi Office continue to be underutilized. Kenya would appreciate seeing maximal utilization of facilities at the headquarters of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (HABITAT) to try and reach the capacity-utilization levels of Geneva and Vienna. In this regard, we wish to thank the Secretary- General for the various measures he has taken, aimed at improving this situation. Kenya, however, still urges that the various General Assembly resolutions on this matter be adhered to. We also note that both UNEP and HABITAT need to be strengthened by streamlining their administrative and financial management. In this connection. Kenya welcomes the establishment of the Task Force on Environment and Human Settlements, whose task is to provide recommendations for new measures to strengthen and restructure those two organizations on the basis of General Assembly resolutions 2997 (XXVII) and 32/162, while taking into account decisions and recommendations of the Governing Council of UNEP and the Commission on Human Settlements. The report of the Task Force captures the challenges we continue to face in this area. It states that human demands on the global life-support system continue to mount as poverty and affluence spread 35 in parallel around the globe. Despite all the efforts made since the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm, the environment continues to deteriorate in many parts of the world. Certain social, economic and technological trends are exacerbating these problems. Against this background, it is imperative that UNEP be strengthened through the provision of adequate and predictable financial resources to better execute its mandate, and that more vigorous and coordinated action be taken to respond effectively to these problems. In line with resolution 52/220, Kenya urges that energetic steps be taken on the funding from the regular budget of the United Nations Office at Nairobi in order to enable it to discharge its mandate. My delegation welcomes this opportunity to express its outrage at and condemnation of the criminal and unjustified terrorist bombings which occurred simultaneously in Nairobi and in Dar-es-Salaam on 7 August 1998. Terrorist acts are by design ruthlessly indiscriminate, and the bomb blast in Nairobi, which occurred at one of the busiest locations in the city in terms of human traffic and commercial activities, was no exception. It has so far claimed 250 lives, and the death toll continues to rise. Damage estimated at over $500 million was caused by the bomb blast. The bombings in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam brought mayhem and terror of an untold magnitude to our two countries, which had hitherto considered themselves secure and far removed from the threats and dangers posed by acts of international terrorism. These two incidents not only make it abundantly clear that nobody is safe or unaffected by such heinous acts, but also exemplify the expanding reach and growing menace of the perpetrators of terrorist acts. Let me take this opportunity on behalf of the Government of Kenya to express gratitude for the generous assistance and support promptly made available in the rescue efforts by Governments and international organizations, and by volunteers who came from far and wide. Kenya welcomes the General Assembly?s adoption earlier this year of the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. In this regard, we wish to underscore the importance of enhancing international cooperation to combat terrorism in accordance with the relevant international instruments. We support the proposal of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries calling for the convening of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations to formulate an organized and concerted response by the international community to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. In conclusion, I wish to reiterate that Kenya will continue to participate actively in the work of the Organization and to bear its rightful share of responsibilities and obligations under the Charter. As we enter the new millennium, we should all contribute to the effort to chart a new course for a reinvigorated United Nations in a manner that fulfils the vision of its founders and meets the challenge of our generation and of generations to come. Allow me at the outset to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election, which attests to the high regard in which the international community holds you and your country, and which France, as an old and true friend of Uruguay, welcomes. We hope that the work of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly will, under your presidency, lead to the strengthening of the Organization. It was 53 years ago in San Francisco that we, “the peoples of the United Nations”, decided to join our efforts “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war...to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person...to establish conditions under which justice...can be maintained, and to promote social progress”. That immense ambition was justified by the recent horrors, which at all costs were to be prevented from happening again — a necessary utopia, perhaps, or a superhuman task. But as the great French writer Albert Camus put it: ”Superhuman tasks are the ones man takes a long time to accomplish, that’s all.” A long time has elapsed, and we are still working on that, still toiling. We have no reason to be ashamed of what we have done as the United Nations throughout these 53 years, of what the Security Council and successive General Assemblies have done, as well as seven Secretaries- General — in particular the current one over the last two years, whose work has been so outstanding. Over the decades, the Security Council, except when paralysed by abuse of the veto, has almost always managed to shoulder its primary responsibility for international security. When it failed to do so, no other institution was able to in its stead. Since its first peacekeeping operation 50 years ago, the Security Council has launched 49 operations of this kind. The institutional framework established by the Charter has, in the most varied situations, ranging from cold war confrontation to the cooperation of recent years, proved its irreplaceable usefulness. This again was borne out in the spring of this year during the Iraqi crisis, when the Secretary-General was deservedly commended; in Africa, during the creation of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic, which was the first entirely new peacekeeping operation in four years; and even in the Balkans, where the difficult mission entrusted to the United Nations in Eastern Slavonia achieved its objective. And yet, as the Secretary-General himself emphasized recently, “Unpredictability and surprise have become almost commonplace” (A/53/1, para. 1), and the illusions of the end of the cold war have not stood the test of reality. Our world, let us acknowledge this fact, is not moving towards greater harmony. Sometimes our interventions are not appropriate; some States take advantage of circumstances and deliberately carry out archaic policies of force that contravene the principles of the Charter. On other occasions, the abdication or implosion of States has released among various groups ancestral forms of hatred that are still very much alive, thus facilitating organized crime. All these are destabilizing factors which, while very different, all help to disorganize and imperil international relations. Several major crises have proved this recently. The Asian financial crisis reminded us that strong growth, when badly regulated, is vulnerable in a globalized world that is all too often dependent on the ultra-sensitive reactions of the trading floors and the increasingly rapid spread of contagious effects. Each day $1,600 billion is exchanged on the financial markets — huge sums of money that are greater than the means of intervention of all the financial institutions of the world. In 1970 those amounts were equal to the world’s gross national product. Today, they are 15 times greater. The nuclear tests in South Asia were a dramatic reminder that a very serious regional territorial dispute combined with a feeling, justified or not, of insecurity could open the way to nuclear and ballistic proliferation. In East Africa, a typical armed conflict was born of a border dispute. In the Great Lakes region, six or seven States are in the grip of regional conflict on the territory 15 of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Destabilization is threatening Central Asia, starting with Afghanistan. I cannot list them all, but currently more than 30 conflicts, civil wars or State break-ups are under way that involve more than 40 countries in their aftermath of suffering. Twenty-two million civilians — displaced persons and returnees — have been affected by these conflicts and require assistance from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which is currently active in 118 countries. Nor can I fail to mention child soldiers; slavery, which still goes on in a scarcely veiled form; disappeared persons; and so many other tragedies. But I do not wish my statement to be a long litany of woe that is only too familiar to the United Nations, which is the first to learn of these situations. Is it not at this very moment trying to maintain peace on four continents with approximately 15,000 personnel engaged in about 17 operations? To cite just one example, no fewer than 20 agencies are trying to rebuild Bosnia. Nor do I intend to neglect the progress achieved in 1998, which I mentioned at the beginning of my statement. I wish simply to explain that the United Nations and the multilateral system do not today have the necessary means to meet all these challenges. But we cannot and must not give up. How can we restore the necessary vigour to our action? Allow me to make some suggestions in this area. First, we can preserve the powers that the Charter has given our institutions. The first priority is to reserve for the Security Council a monopoly on legitimate enforcement action in the case of “threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and acts of aggression”. Nothing can justify the use of force by a State, a group of States or an organization, however powerful, if prior authorization was not received from the Security Council — except in cases of self-defence. My country shares the impatience of those who deplore the fact that it should take so long to find a solution to various cruel conflicts — for example, in Kosovo, where the humanitarian situation is so critical. Since November 1997 France has warned of the risks of explosion; it has put forward many proposals in liaison with Germany and its other partners in the Contact Group to prepare the ground for a realistic political solution. It has just begun action for the return of refugees. It has never ruled out the possible use of force. On this latter point, I hear voices urging us to forgo the authorization of the Security Council. But after this case there would be another exception, and then another. Little by little, any country would declare itself entitled to intervene wherever its interests, security or ambitions so required, and we would have to begin all over again. We must remain firm on this principle. Second, we must make sure that the authority of the Security Council is respected and its resolutions are complied with. This goes for all its resolutions. But today the question arises particularly in connection with Iraq. The lifting of the oil embargo has, by the Council’s resolutions, been made subject to the controlled dismantling of its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq must therefore meet these conditions — completely meet them, but only them. Once that objective is achieved, our aim must be to reintegrate Iraq into the international community, starting with the region. The only way to achieve that end is by Iraq’s complete compliance with the relevant resolutions — all the resolutions, nothing but the resolutions — which means Iraq’s unreserved cooperation with the United Nations and the bodies empowered to monitor Iraq’s disarmament. The third need is to increase the representativeness of the Security Council in order to increase its legitimacy. This is why my country has come out in favour of enlarging the Security Council, with, on the one hand, new permanent members — two seats for the North, to which Germany and Japan have every claim, and three for the South; on the other hand, there should be new non-permanent members for the North and South. This enlargement must at the same time preserve the Council’s effectiveness and not prevent it from carrying out its responsibilities under the Charter. I hope this fifty-third session of the Assembly will see progress on this reform. Fourth, we must increase the capacity of our Organization to prevent or settle regional crises. There is much to be done. Now that the international community has just commemorated on a melancholy note the fifth anniversary of the Oslo accords, what remains of the peace process in the Middle East and the hopes born in Madrid? There is no longer a light shining in the night, and the fires of hatred are gaining ground. France continues to support the persevering efforts of the United States Secretary of State, but we do not wish to be left without any prospects at all should those efforts unfortunately not succeed. That is why President Chirac and President Mubarak have proposed in that event convening a conference of countries resolved to save the 16 peace. This concern for the future has been very well received. In liaison with Mr. Amre Moussa, we are working to further our proposal. We must not abandon the goal of meeting the aspirations of the peoples of this region for a just and lasting peace which respects the resolutions and agreements that have been reached. Another region in crisis calls for our attention. As I mentioned earlier on the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo six or seven African States of the Great Lakes region are engaged in confrontation in a tangle of problems involving border issues, guerrilla activities, ethnic strife, refugees, the quest for arable land and so forth. It is illusory to hope for a separate settlement in each of these States. A regional crisis such as this calls for a regional solution. That is why my country has raised again the idea of a conference for peace in the Great Lakes region, which we suggested as early as 1995. The conference would be placed under the aegis of the United Nations or the Organization of African Unity, with the active participation of the States of the region. Several African diplomatic initiatives have the same goal. We support those efforts. Africa is currently the theatre of other crises. Let us pay tribute to the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General’s representatives. Here I salute in particular the memory of Matre Blondin Beye, who died while on a peace mission. Fifth, there is a need to reinforce the multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation system. Following the nuclear tests in South Asia, whose risks everyone recognizes, we must strengthen the anti-proliferation regime and pursue the disarmament process in all areas — nuclear, conventional, chemical and biological. Our primary objective here should be the entry into force as speedily as possible of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. France, together with the United Kingdom, was the first nuclear-weapon State to ratify the Treaty and is the only one to have completed the dismantlement of its testing centre. I call on all States that have not yet done so to accede to this Treaty — including India and Pakistan, which have announced their intention not to carry out any more nuclear tests. Another objective here would be a treaty banning the production of fissile material for military purposes. I proposed at the meeting of the five permanent members of the Security Council held in Geneva on 4 June last that we should launch such a negotiation. A universal, non- discriminatory and verifiable cut-off treaty would give new impetus to disarmament. We should also pursue relentlessly the prohibition of chemical and biological weapons. Let us see to it that the Convention banning chemical weapons becomes universal and that the Convention banning biological weapons is made truly effective through a verification mechanism. Combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction also means preventing the spread of vehicles capable of delivering such weapons, while preserving useful civilian applications. In order to make progress in conventional disarmament, let us ensure that the Ottawa Convention providing for a comprehensive ban on anti-personnel mines comes into force as soon as possible. Sixth, we should continue to combat underdevelopment, whose link with crises needs no further demonstration. France remains heavily committed; it is the second largest provider of official development assistance. In order to modernize its aid and make it more effective, France has decided to reform its cooperation arrangements and increase coordination with other donors — in the first place with the European Union. More than 60 per cent of aid to Africa comes from the European Union. Europe is also the largest source of aid to Latin America and the second largest to Asia. France would like development resources to be more predictable. The Secretary-General has made proposals that we welcome in a constructive spirit, in particular the idea of a development account. We encourage the United Nations to continue its discussions in this area. Seventh, we need to work with the non- governmental organizations. They are capable of sounding the alarm, making proposals and cooperating in very practical terms to help build States governed by the rule of law. Parallel to these actions, we expect much from the activities of Mrs. Robinson, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, both in the Commission on Human Rights and in the various United Nations agencies, which must also — all of them — integrate the human rights dimension into their activities. After more than 10 years of negotiations, 1998 will see the adoption of the declaration on the defenders of human rights. This is a crucial text because these are the rights that dictatorships try to stifle and threaten. 17 However, even if we reinforce the Security Council, strengthen the hand of the Secretary-General and better handle future crises and other aspects of existing ones, this will still not be enough. We must regain the initiative, and for that we must extend our efforts to bring worldwide regulation to other fields. This brings me to my final points. The eighth requirement is to extend the rule of law in all its aspects. The Statute of a permanent International Criminal Court was adopted in Rome after intensive negotiations. It is a major step forward in the fight against the impunity of the foremost criminals. France was one of the first to sign it. The Statute achieves an essential synthesis of the various legal traditions in the world and strikes a balance between the Court’s competences and the powers of the Security Council that is in keeping with the spirit and calling of the United Nations. We hope that those countries that still have reservations will be able to join us. In another field of law, the International Labour Organization has taken a historic step towards universal compliance with basic labour standards through the declaration adopted at its eighty-sixth conference, which is a commitment on the part of the 174 member States of the Organization. On 11 November 1997 the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization adopted the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights. This is the first normative framework to guide the international community in an area of scientific research where advances are already shaking our traditional concepts of life and social organization. France is submitting a draft resolution calling on the General Assembly to endorse this Universal Declaration. Ninth, we must contain and reduce the scourge of organized crime, beginning with drugs. The volume of illegal drug trafficking now approaches $500 billion — 8 per cent to 10 per cent of world trade. According to the International Monetary Fund, money-laundering operations represent from 2 per cent to 5 per cent of global gross domestic product. At the special session in New York in June we decided to put more emphasis on reducing the demand for drugs, in addition to what we have done about supply. Let us do so. Tenth, we must combat terrorism in all its forms, whoever the perpetrators and whatever their motivation. The recent International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings is an important step forward, but that is not enough. We must also acquire the means to hunt down those who finance and instigate these attacks. France is proposing the negotiation of a universal convention against the financing of terrorism. We need to define concrete mechanisms for legal measures and mutual judicial assistance against those who finance terrorism. Effective sanctions, such as the seizure or the freezing of the assets of organizations or individuals that have participated in terrorist acts must be provided for. Innovative measures, such as making it impossible to invoke banking secrecy in judicial bodies investigating a terrorist attack, should be introduced. If we have the will to do this, we can launch this negotiation at the end of the present session of the General Assembly. President Clinton spoke here on Monday of this common struggle as a shared obligation. This is correct. In addition, we need to attack the multiple causes that breed terrorism. The eleventh point I would like to make concerns the remedy for not only the current financial crises, but also the malfunctioning of the international financial system as such. That is the issue here, as is shown by the increasing calls for a “new Bretton Woods”. Financial globalization is running wild now. New means urgently need to be found. It is the responsibility of each State to make its contribution. We need also to define new rules adapted to today’s financial realities. My country is today presenting to its European partners some proposals to counter international financial instability. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) must naturally remain the pivot here. But the IMF must be more legitimate and more effective, working on the basis of clear, realistic, political and strategic guidelines, cooperating with other competent bodies, organizing dialogue between industrialized countries and emerging countries, ensuring the transparency of the financial system and reflecting the economic, social and political realities of partner countries — an IMF that can detect early warning signs to prevent crises from happening. Within this transformation, to which the Director- General of the IMF is making an important contribution, and also in order better to stabilize the international economic and monetary situation and to support world growth, Europe will play an increasingly important role 18 since it is finalizing the introduction of its single currency, the euro, and we are anticipating the benefits. From this period we are living through, which is so full of contrasts, consisting of unprecedented progress and of crises threatening to wipe out our efforts, in particular those made under the aegis of the United Nations, additional progress must be forthcoming in building a more just and more peaceful world, because this is what we all want. Today’s world needs rules. The United Nations must remain the unifying framework, and the Charter must remain the reference point. Preserving what has proved its worth, adapting when necessary, inventing new forms of regulation — these are three main areas for our work.  I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as President of this body. I have no doubt that your diplomatic experience and proven leadership will guide us successfully in our work. Allow me also to thank your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for the determined leadership with which he steered the work of the fifty- second session. The United Nations, being the primary vehicle for the pursuit of world peace, has striven throughout its existence to make the world a better place to live in. Despite adversities of all kinds, caused particularly by opposing national interests, violent conflicts, natural disasters and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the United Nations has pursued consistently the noble goals enshrined in its Charter, first and foremost the elimination of the scourge of war and the achievement of economic development. To be realistic, however, the hopes of mankind for a new and genuinely just international legal and political order, generated by the demise of the bipolar world, are yet to be realized. Cyprus reaffirms its commitment to work closely with the other members of the Organization for the attainment of our common goals. We support, therefore, the reform efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi 3 Annan, to streamline the operations of the Organization in a way that assures its ability to pursue its goals, meet new challenges and safeguard its financial position. We stress once more the importance of restructuring the Security Council to make it more representative and transparent. Cyprus welcomes the adoption of the Statute of a permanent International Criminal Court, empowering it to bring to justice the perpetrators of most serious crimes and violations of humanitarian law. In this respect, we consider the first-ever judgement by the international criminal court for Rwanda on the crime of genocide a very important step. Of special concern is the rising number of refugees and internally displaced persons. Their plight calls not only for international cooperation in providing protection and humanitarian assistance, but also for addressing the root causes of displacement. We continue to believe that the best solution is the return of refugees to their homes in conditions of safety, with full protection of their human rights. Cyprus condemns terrorism, which it considers a menace to humanity, requiring effective international action and solutions on the basis of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. The situation in the Middle East continues to be characterized by lack of progress and obstacles to the implementation of the peace accords. The current stalemate poses a threat to the stability of the region. Cyprus, a neighbouring State with close relations to the parties involved, reiterates its support for the achievement of a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement based on the relevant United Nations resolutions. I would like to reiterate my country?s support for the documents adopted at the General Assembly special session on the world drug problem and for the relevant efforts of the United Nations. Cyprus welcomes the recent report of the Secretary- General on the situation in Africa. His recommendations merit serious consideration and support by the international community. We believe that the international community should redouble its efforts towards assisting African countries, with special attention given to debt relief, so that they can avoid further instability and the danger of marginalization. Cyprus joined in the worldwide rejoicing over the agreement of last April concerning Northern Ireland. It is important for the sides to honour their responsibilities and meet their commitments. We condemn acts of violence, which should not be allowed to block the road to peace, reconciliation and prosperity. Cyprus supports strongly the efforts in the area of arms control and disarmament. Since my last appearance before this body, we have ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention; we have also signed, and will soon ratify, the Convention on anti-personnel mines. I should emphasize in this respect that, in spite of the difficult situation we face because of the presence of an occupation army force of 36,000 troops, Cyprus has decided to sign the Convention as an expression of our determination to join the forces struggling to eliminate this utterly cruel method of war. We are grateful to Canada for promising to finance the undertaking to clear the minefields along the ceasefire line in our country. The United Nations has a special role to play in the promotion of the well-being of small States. Small States are often exposed to a much greater degree than larger States to threats because of increased vulnerability of their environment and security. In this connection, Cyprus has suffered for more than 24 years the grave consequences of the Turkish invasion and the continuing occupation of more than one third of its territory. Despite the pronounced will of the international community through numerous resolutions and the willingness of the Greek Cypriot side to negotiate in good faith, no solution of the Cyprus problem has resulted. It is, therefore, reasonable to ask why. The answer is: It is because of the non-implementation and flagrant violation of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions by Turkey. I feel that it is necessary to give some examples of these flagrant violations which prevented solution of the Cyprus problem. Security Council and General Assembly resolutions calling for respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and non- recognition of the Turkish Cypriot breakaway entity were violated by Turkey, which is the only State which recognized the Turkish Cypriot secessionist entity, and which sustains it financially and militarily. As regards Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, calling for the speedy withdrawal of all foreign armed forces and personnel from the Republic of Cyprus, not only have the Turkish armed forces and personnel not been withdrawn, but they have been 4 increased and upgraded, to such an extent that the previous Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, described in his report to the Security Council the occupied area of Cyprus as one of the most militarized areas in the world. United Nations resolutions for the return of the refugees to their homes under conditions of safety were not implemented, not only because Turkish forces prevented the refugees from returning, but also because Turkey, violating other provisions of United Nations resolutions calling on all parties concerned to avoid any action to change the demographic composition of the population of Cyprus, imported to Cyprus thousands of illegal settlers from Turkey, usurped the properties of the refugees and installed settlers in them. I could go on giving examples of gross violations of United Nations resolutions by Turkey, but in order to confine myself to the time limits allowed, I will refer only to the latest violation. The recent demand of the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mr. Denktas, in the presence of the Turkish Foreign Minister, violates all United Nations resolutions, which call for a bizonal-bicommunal federation, with a single sovereignty, international personality and citizenship, and is aimed at derailing the negotiating process from the base of the United Nations resolutions on Cyprus, and also at extinguishing the independence of the Republic of Cyprus and creating, under the guise of a Turkish Cypriot Republic, a Turkish colony in Cyprus or, to say the least, a Turkish protectorate. The non-implementation of United Nations resolutions on Cyprus tarnishes the image of the United Nations and its main bodies. The former Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in one of his reports to the Security Council, identified as a cause of the absence of progress in Cyprus the lack of political will on the part of the Turkish side. With that report the diagnosis of the causes of the failure to make progress towards a solution is completed. Is it too much for the people of Cyprus to ask what the next step will be? Will the United Nations finally take the necessary action to apply the required remedy in order to put an end to the tragedy that has befallen our small State and that has continued for 24 years? The international community should not allow one State to violate for so long its expressed will. The Security Council, the main organ for international peace and security, should proceed to examine how to implement its resolutions as soon as possible. I now want to address the problem of Cyprus, not by looking at the past, but by outlining my goals for the future. The Cyprus problem has been with us for over 40 years. Today, the two communities of Cyprus are led by the generation that was involved in the earliest stages of the Cyprus problem. This generation knows both the joys of friendships that crossed communal lines and the tragedies and suffering that also crossed communal lines. Rauf Denktas¸ and I are both members of this generation, which has seen the best and the worst of the recent history of Cyprus. Our communities have entrusted us with their respective leaderships. The people of Cyprus, both Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, look to us, their leaders, to help shape a future that is better than the present and that will not allow for a repetition of the past. Let me offer my vision for the future. I want all Cypriots to have security in their homes and their communities; I want all Cypriots to pursue their livelihoods free of economic restrictions and the fear of instability; I want all Cypriot children to know their distinct cultural and religious heritage and to be able to carry their identity and political rights into the future without fear of domination from any quarter. The solution to any constitutional problem on the basis of communal or ethnic criteria and federalism contains elements of partnership and political equality of the constituent parts. The solution to the Cyprus problem on the basis of a bicommunal-bizonal federation requires such a partnership of the two communities as would constitutionally provide for a maximum degree of internal self-administration for the two constituent cantons, provinces or States, and, adhering to the principle of the equal political status of the constituent parts, it must provide them with the same rights, powers and functions regarding their respective separate, internal self- administration. The constitution must also provide for effective participation of the constituent parts in the federal government. It must also secure all fundamental human rights and freedoms for all the citizens of the federation. Above all, it must safeguard the single sovereignty, the indivisibility and the unity of the bicommunal-bizonal federation. Such a federation, becoming a member of the European Union, will thrive at home and abroad. 5 One of the questions we should ask when looking at various ideas for a solution is: Do they reasonably meet the needs of the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots, and will they promote stability and encourage cooperation and partnership among the people of Cyprus? It is obvious that a bicommunal solution must be negotiated, not only because all United Nations resolutions so demand, but also because only in negotiations can we work out the practical steps needed to realize a functioning solution. Security for both communities is a fundamental part of any settlement; this will require arrangements special to Cyprus. To be effective, an agreement to this end must produce a settlement that can meet the real life challenges inherent to a small island State. I believe that the gap between what ordinary Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots want and need in a settlement is not so great as it might appear. Both want the same things: peace, prosperity, stability and physical, political, economic and cultural security, including respect for and enjoyment of their homes and properties. I am confident that, working together under the umbrella of the United Nations and with the help of the international community, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots can construct a settlement that meets these needs and removes the fears and insecurities that have plagued Cyprus since the middle part of this century. To do this, we must begin serious negotiations. I believe that we, the current generation of leadership, must negotiate a settlement to our decades-old problem that will give all the people of Cyprus a future that will ensure that the bitter experiences of the past cannot and shall not be repeated. We, the older generation of both communities, must close this sad chapter of Cyprus?s history with an agreement between us which will allow generations to come to build and realize the fruits of true partnership, based on mutual respect and political understanding. While we cannot reconcile ourselves with the Turkish invasion and occupation, we are genuinely determined to renew and invigorate bicommunal confidence and trust, cooperation and interaction with our Turkish Cypriot compatriots. In my investiture speech last February, I extended a hand of friendship and urged the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mr. Denktas, to join me in working together towards finding a solution to the tragic problem of Cyprus for the benefit of all the citizens of the island. Similarly, I invited the Turkish Cypriots to participate as full members in the Cypriot delegation negotiating the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, thus shaping together our positions and common destiny. Today, before the representatives of the international community and from the podium of this Assembly, adhering to the will of the international community for an agreed solution to the Cyprus problem within the parameters set forth in United Nations resolutions, as leader of the Greek Cypriot community, I renew my invitation to the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community, Mr. Rauf Denktas, to work together for the solution of the Cyprus problem in order to build a happy and prosperous island for our children and future generations. The interests of Cyprus lie in the unity and interaction of the two communities. The continuing tension prevents Cyprus and its people from assuming their rightful role and making their contribution to regional stability and the improvement of Greco-Turkish relations. The Government of Cyprus is committed to a peaceful solution, on the basis of the United Nations resolutions, which will safeguard the interests and the human rights of all its citizens. We have consistently put forward proposals for the reduction of tension on the island. Tension in Cyprus escalates because of the massive presence of the Turkish occupation forces in the north, their continuous strengthening and upgrading, and the corresponding need the Government of the Republic feels to strengthen its defences. The Security Council, recognizing that the increase in tension is due to the build-up of military forces, has called in a number of its resolutions for the reduction of forces and armaments. While the Government of the Republic of Cyprus will continue to exercise its sovereign right to strengthen its defences with whatever means it considers necessary for as long as Turkish occupation forces remain in Cyprus, I have not failed, in response to Security Council resolutions, to suggest concrete ways and measures to work for a specific programme of reduction of foreign and local forces and equipment as a necessary preparatory step for the programmed and final withdrawal of all foreign forces and other elements and for the demilitarization of Cyprus. These proposals and suggestions, on our part, are still valid and timely, and as 6 such they remain on the negotiating table. We remain committed to a solution to the problem by peaceful means, and for this a lessening of tension is a necessary ingredient. In the face of continuous threats against Cyprus by the vastly superior military might of Turkey, whose ultimate aim is to keep the island a perpetual hostage, to destroy its sovereignty and to reduce it to a Turkish protectorate, the strong, principled support of United Nations Members is of paramount importance. At this point, I wish to thank the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the Security Council and the Secretary-General for discussing the Cyprus problem on 24 September 1998 and for issuing a statement calling for an early resumption of a sustained process of direct negotiations between the two communities, reminding them at the same time of the need to achieve a comprehensive political settlement in accordance with Security Council resolutions and to avoid any actions which might increase tension. I reply “Yes” to the resumption of a sustained process of direct negotiations on the basis of Security Council resolutions; I reply “Yes” to avoiding any action that might increase tension and thus jeopardize progress in the negotiating process. We trust that we can rely once again on the active solidarity of Members at this crucial juncture, as the most sacred principles of the United Nations Charter and the credibility of the world public order itself come into focus in this respect. As we approach the new millennium, the leaders of the world must decide what kind of world we want our children and grandchildren to live in. Is it a world of sheer interests and lack of principles, where cold calculations of economic and strategic interests are pre-eminent, or a world governed by justice and respect for human rights, which is the only solution for permanent peace and stability in the world?I take pleasure in congratulating Mr. Opertti on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session, and I pledge my delegation’s full cooperation. I commend his predecessor, Mr. Udovenko, for bringing the fifty-second session of the General Assembly to a successful conclusion. I take great pleasure in expressing my pride in our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan. His leadership and many achievements during the short period of his tenure are highly commendable. Just as this session of the General Assembly coincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it also coincides, providentially, with the fiftieth anniversary of the commencement of peacekeeping operations by the United Nations. These coincidences are striking because, while one was envisaged in the Charter of our Organization and was the subject of painstaking negotiations, the other was a chance development, not having been envisaged in the Charter. Yet both have had a profound effect on the influence of the United Nations in global affairs and on the perception of the Organization by those whom it was established to serve and who were identified in the opening words of the Charter as “We the peoples of the United Nations”. The double celebration this year should also enable us to appreciate better the interrelationship between human rights and peacekeeping. There can be no question of human rights being enjoyed in a situation of conflict. Put another way, conflicts create conditions for the most outrageous violations of human rights, since, contrary to all international law and rationality, the most vulnerable in society — children, women and the aged — are often targeted and deprived of the most basic of human rights, the right to life. As we define and refine our Organization’s responsibilities in peacekeeping, which, by common consent, is now taken in its broadest sense to mean the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts, let us always be conscious that the universal enjoyment of human rights, one of the major aspirations of humanity, cannot and will not be achieved unless we devote as much effort to the elimination of the conditions that provoke the violation of those rights. I believe that it is with this fact in mind that international organizations, whether global, regional or subregional, have been devoting considerable time to devising effective means of preventing, managing and resolving conflicts in their various area of competence. Of course, the United Nations, with its unique role as the only global Organization invested with authority for the maintenance of international peace and security, is, appropriately, taking the lead in these efforts. Following “An Agenda for Peace” (A/47/277) and its supplement (A/50/60), and at the request of the Security Council, the 4 Secretary-General presented to us at this session his report entitled “The causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa”, document A/52/871. The report represents a very comprehensive and incisive study of the causes of conflict in Africa. The recommendations therein, if implemented by African countries as well as by the United Nations, could reverse the pestilence of conflicts which are ravaging the continent. In this connection, my delegation would like to underscore the role of the Security Council in dealing with African conflicts. While the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has demonstrated a commitment to taking the lead in the resolution of conflicts on the continent, the fact is that its Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution will take time and will require resources not immediately available to Africa if it is to evolve to its maximum capacity. In the meantime, the efforts of the subregional organizations, which are increasingly taking the initiative in their various regions, need to be adequately supported by the international community. My country, the Central African Republic, has been the beneficiary of such an initiative, which was taken by a group of African countries, to deal with the internal conflicts that erupted with three successive army mutinies in 1996. The Inter-African Mission to Monitor the Implementation of the Bangui Agreements (MISAB), which was composed of troops from Gabon, Chad, Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal and Togo, was given strong logistic support by France. It operated in Bangui from January 1997 to April 1998 as both a force of interposition and a guarantor to ensure the observance of the peace accord which was brokered by four African heads of State. My delegation would like to pay very high tribute to the Presidents of Gabon, Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Senegal and Togo for the great sacrifice they made in the interests of our continent. I should also like to pay great tribute to France for its invaluable support of the African initiative. At the request of my head of State, and with the agreement of the inter- African group, the Security Council graciously consented to send a United Nations peacekeeping operation to replace the inter African force. The United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA), which commenced operations in Bangui on 15 April 1998, is the first proactive mission established by the United Nations in Africa. It has been making a major contribution to the restoration of lasting peace and security in our country and has assisted the peace-building efforts of the Government and the people of the Central African Republic. It is a practical demonstration of the incisive observation of our Secretary-General, in his report entitled “The causes of conflicts and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa”, to the effect that “the deployment of a multidisciplinary peacekeeping operation may well represent the best chance to establish peace and build a foundation for lasting development, based on respect for human rights and the rehabilitation of civic institutions.” (A/52/871, para. 37) A major step in the restoration of the institutions of State in our country is the organization of a free, fair and transparent legislative election. In his letter to the Secretary-General requesting the assistance of the international community in re-establishing peace and security, my President, Mr. Ange-Félix Patassé, invited the United Nations, inter alia, to supervise the legislative and presidential elections in the country. That request was a measure of both the confidence which we have in the United Nations and our commitment to a transparent democracy built on the freely expressed will of our people. I wish therefore to express my Government’s satisfaction for the assistance of MINURCA in the preparations for the legislative elections. We are looking forward to the decision of the Security Council which will enable MINURCA to provide further assistance for the electoral process, thus giving all Central Africans the assurance of the freedom, fairness and transparency of this most important aspect of the democratic process. Needless to say, United Nations assistance in the process is a worthwhile investment in good governance, which itself is the sure foundation for peace, security and development. No effort should therefore be spared by our Organization in rallying to the support of those Member States that are making genuine efforts to instal a system that in itself constitutes a conflict-prevention mechanism. The cost of such support, which also constitutes an investment in peace-building, is in the end much less, and the results more satisfying, than those of a fire-fighting response after the outbreak of a conflict. Bearing these factors in mind, I wish to appeal, on behalf of my Government, to the Security Council to take a comprehensive approach that avoids a premature exit of MINURCA, thus compromising the objective for which the Mission was installed in Bangui. My Government has 5 exerted itself to fulfil the commitments made by President Patassé to transparency and accountability in his letter to the Secretary-General requesting the presence of the United Nations in our country. One major result of those efforts was the positive judgment of the Bretton Woods institutions which permitted the conclusion last July of a long-sought accord on enhanced structural adjustment facility. Needless to say, this would not have been possible without the assurance of security given by the presence and the activities of MINURCA. However, much remains to be done, and the presence and cooperation of MINURCA will be indispensable for success. Most important is the restructuring and retraining of our security services, both civil and military. The commencement by MINURCA of the retraining of the various categories of our police and gendarmerie services have already yielded some positive results, and the continuation of the programme, as is being done in other United Nations operations in other parts of the world, will prove an invaluable legacy of United Nations peace- building efforts in our country. Africa should not be denied this benefit which emanates from the reappraisal of the components of comprehensive United Nations peacekeeping operations. Civilian police training programmes have become an essential element of these operations, but they have not been known to commence and end in a period of nine months. An African situation cannot be presumed to be different, particularly when it is in the region now considered to be most prone to the phenomenon of conflicts. Besides, the restructuring of our armed forces is being commenced with the involvement of MINURCA, which was given a role to play by Security Council resolution 1182 (1998) of 14 July 1998. The joint committee consisting of representatives of the Government and of MINURCA is to elaborate the legal instrument which should form the basis for our defence policy and armed forces, as well as a comprehensive programme for a widely representative, national, and well-trained force that will also be a useful instrument for development. The hope of my Government is that the Security Council will allow MINURCA sufficient time to assist us in these indispensable peace-building endeavours. A withdrawal, as is being contemplated at this time, will not be in the interest of my country or of the Central African subregion, which is already in great turmoil. I cannot but recall once again the very pertinent observation of the Secretary- General in the report which he painstakingly compiled at the request of the Security Council: “the deployment of a multidisciplinary peacekeeping operation may well represent the best chance to establish peace and build a foundation for lasting development, based on respect for human rights and the rehabilitation of civic institutions.” (ibid.)  May I begin, Sir, by congratulating you on your election as President of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. I am confident that the skills and vast experience you have acquired throughout your distinguished diplomatic career will provide the guidance we need to guarantee the successful outcome of the session. I must also recall the valuable contribution of your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, to the work of the last session of the General Assembly. This year, 1998, has been a year of warning signals and signs of hope. We have witnessed both setbacks and strides forward in the quest for peace and international security. In particular, we have witnessed great progress towards the settlement of one of the longest and most intractable conflicts — that of Northern Ireland. The Irish peace agreement has proved to the world that it is never too late to find answers to seemingly impossible problems. Unfortunately, wars, armed conflicts, acts of terrorism and other forms of violence have shaken the world during this last year and have had a negative impact on international stability and security. A party to all international treaties in the sphere of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, Armenia is deeply concerned about the possible consequences of nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan this year. We believe that as the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) comes into force, it will contribute substantially to the strengthening of international security. Also, within the framework of the Conference on Disarmament, Armenia supports drafting agreements on the prohibition of the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices. The United Nations plays a great role in different aspects of international life, ranging from tackling global environmental problems to combating organized crime and illicit drug trafficking. In support of United Nations activities in these spheres, Armenia actively participated in the twentieth special session of the General Assembly. We strongly believe that the illicit traffic in drugs and psychotropic substances seriously jeopardizes the economic prosperity and political stability of many countries and regions of the world. Armenia also actively participated in activities leading to the establishment of the International Criminal Court, since we attach great importance to the battle against international crime, including the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Believing that the United Nations should play the leading role in the formation of an international anti-criminal strategy, Armenia supports the idea of holding, in Vienna, in the year 2000, the tenth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Treatment of Offenders. Armenia unequivocally condemns all acts of terrorism as acts that have no justification on political, ideological, ethnic, religious or any other grounds. The recent terrorist attacks in Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania once again show us the necessity for cooperation among all countries to combat that evil. We call for the accession of the maximum number of countries to universal conventions against terrorism, and support the Russian proposal on a United Nations convention for combating acts of nuclear terrorism. Armenia likewise supports including on the agenda of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly issues dealing with the declaration by the United Nations of a decade of international law, as well as events to be organized in 1999 devoted to the hundredth anniversary of the first International Peace Conference. For the international community, this year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The semi-centennial anniversary of the Declaration enables the States Members of the United Nations to conduct a review of human rights conditions in their own countries and to identify ways further to develop the foundations of democracy and to promote human and national rights. This year also marks the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. It is well known that the international community did not, at the time, duly condemn the genocide of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire in 1915, and that failure encouraged certain regimes to commit new crimes of genocide. After the Holocaust, the United Nations addressed the problem of genocide, defining it as a crime against humanity, and adopted, on 9 December 1948, the aforementioned Convention. Despite that fact, over the past five decades, crimes of genocide have been committed in various parts of the world on more than one occasion. The recent recognition and condemnation by several parliaments of the genocide of Armenians committed early in this century is evidence of an increased understanding of the necessity to combat that evil. The General Assembly, upon the submission of Armenia and five other Member States, included on the agenda of this session an item on the fiftieth anniversary of the genocide Convention. We hope that, by combining its efforts in the struggle against the crime of genocide, humanity will take a decisive step towards the elimination of that crime in the next century. Equality and mutually beneficial cooperation among countries in the political and commercial-economic spheres, based on free market principles, should become an important factor for political stability in the third millennium. We have no other choice. Armenia adheres to this policy in all its dealings, from its approach to cooperation with international organizations to the process of becoming a member of the World Trade Organization. We attach special significance to regional cooperation, be it in the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Black Sea Economic Cooperation organization or the TRASECA project. Armenia is sincerely open to such cooperation, although we have to state with regret that the blockade imposed on Armenia by Turkey and Azerbaijan is a serious obstacle to such cooperation. It is obvious that the region?s vast potential cannot be fully exploited if attempts are made to isolate one of its constituents. Such attempts are doomed to failure. Another factor of concern for political-military stability in the region is the gross violation by Azerbaijan of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. In three categories of ground equipment identified in the Treaty, our neighbour significantly surpasses the national limits set by the Treaty. Despite the potential threat to our security, since the earliest days of our independence we have clearly and unambiguously forsworn the development of weapons of mass destruction and adhere to the principles of non- proliferation of such weapons and of control over the destabilizing accumulation of conventional arms. The peaceful settlement of regional conflicts is one of the most important safeguards of stability and peace in our region, the Transcaucasus. Armenia is committed to 2 the ceasefire established in the Karabakh zone of conflict in May 1994 and will assist in its rigorous maintenance. We emphasize the contribution of the Minsk Group and of its individual member States, both to the maintenance of the ceasefire and to mediation. Unfortunately, at present, the negotiation process is at an impasse. We believe that the main reasons for this impasse are the unclear definition of Nagorny Karabakh?s status as a party to the negotiations; Azerbaijan?s refusal to negotiate directly with the leaders of Nagorny Karabakh; and its insistence on preconditions regarding the future status of Nagorny Karabakh, which we believe must be negotiated. The international community must make every effort to overcome these obstacles. In our opinion, given the intensity and specifics of the Nagorny Karabakh conflict, its resolution demands unconventional approaches based on the principle of equal legal rights for the parties to the conflict, an end to the enclave status of Nagorny Karabakh and the provision of international security guarantees for its population. Armenia is ready to move forward and calls on Azerbaijan to resume negotiations without preconditions in order to reach a comprehensive settlement for the Nagorny Karabakh conflict. The challenges that the international community faces today are diverse and complicated. We are convinced that only a reformed United Nations can cope successfully and effectively with the increasing number of problems. This holds true especially for the reform of the Security Council, since the maintenance of peace and security throughout the world depends on a Security Council that functions effectively. We also call for deeper institutional reform of the United Nations, including in the administrative- budgetary sphere. We believe that the fulfilment by all Member States of their financial obligations under the United Nations Charter is indispensable if the Organization?s acute financial crisis is to be overcome. Despite serious economic hardships, Armenia will fulfil its duties in this sphere. We need only recognize that a stronger and reformed United Nations serves our common interests. I wish to congratulate Mr. Opertti on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its current session. I believe that his wisdom and experience will enable him to accomplish his important mission with distinction. I would also like to express my appreciation for the contribution made by Mr. Udovenko as President of the General Assembly during the previous session. At present, the international situation is undergoing profound changes. The accelerated trend towards multipolarity has injected new vitality into international relations. Economic globalization is developing very quickly, and countries are becoming increasingly interdependent. The development of multipolarity and globalization has provided a stimulus to the readjustment of international relations. Bilateral partnerships, mainly characterized by non- confrontation, non-alignment and non-targeting against third countries, have been established one after another. Various regional and intercontinental organizations of cooperation have become more active than ever before. Such endeavours to seek the establishment of stable, pragmatic and balanced international relations contribute to peace and development as well as to the establishment of a fair and equitable new international political and economic order. 10 However, we cannot lose sight of the many uncertainties still existing in the world. The nuclear arms race is a product of the cold war. In the post-cold-war period of today, the people of all countries call fervently for the prevention of nuclear proliferation and endeavours for nuclear disarmament. It is to be regretted that last May India conducted nuclear tests, going against the tide of the times, thus adversely affecting peace and stability in South Asia. Soon afterwards, Pakistan, too, conducted nuclear tests. Their nuclear tests not only led to an escalation of the tension between the two countries, but also dealt a heavy blow to international nuclear disarmament and the mechanism for the prevention of nuclear proliferation. This has aroused the great concern of the international community. We hope that India and Pakistan will fully implement the Joint Communiqué of the five permanent members of the Security Council, as well as the provisions of Security Council resolution 1172 (1998), give up their plans to develop nuclear weapons and immediately and unconditionally accede to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We appeal to India and Pakistan to resolve the dispute over the issue of Kashmir through peaceful means. In our view, following the nuclear tests in South Asia, the international community faces the pressing task of consolidating and strengthening the international non- proliferation mechanism to prevent further proliferation of nuclear weapons and enhance the universality and authority of the NPT. China has all along stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. Back in 1994, the Chinese Government proposed to the General Assembly that a treaty on the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons should be concluded through negotiations. Furthermore, the Chinese Government has on many occasions called on all the other nuclear States to undertake not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States and nuclear-free zones, has proposed the conclusion of a convention on no first use of nuclear weapons through negotiations and has called for the early negotiation of a fissile material cut-off treaty. China was active in the negotiations on the CTBT and was among the first to sign the Treaty. Today, I would like to reiterate on behalf of the Chinese Government that China will abide by the provisions of the Treaty and has no intention of resuming nuclear testing. China will continue to pursue the policies of unconditional no first use of nuclear weapons and unconditional no use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States and nuclear-free zones and will continue to support the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to negotiate and conclude a non-discriminatory and verifiable fissile material cut-off treaty on the basis of the agreed mandate. China urges the countries with the largest nuclear arsenals to accelerate their nuclear disarmament process. As to the question of the ultimate complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, China, as a nuclear State, will never shirk its responsibility. The East Asian financial crisis that broke out in July 1997 has caused a sharp decline in the economies of many countries of the region. Its negative impact is still spreading. The drastic devaluation of the Japanese yen since last June has added to the difficulty of economic recovery in the region. The crisis occurred in the overall context of economic globalization, and its impact is being felt across the world. Stepping up international cooperation and putting an early end to this crisis is not only in the immediate interests of the East Asian countries, but also in the interests of the international community as a whole, and especially of the developed countries. We hope that those developed countries with important influence on the region’s economy will shoulder their responsibilities and take active, resolute and effective measures to make their due contributions to safeguarding the stability of the financial order and promoting the recovery and development of the region’s economy. Following the eruption of the East Asian financial crisis, the Chinese Government has taken a highly responsible attitude. China has rendered assistance to the countries concerned within the framework arranged by International Monetary Fund and, at the same time, through bilateral channels. Proceeding from the overall interests of maintaining the stability and development of the region, China has made the decision not to devalue the yuan renminbi, for which we have endured great pressure and paid a heavy price. Now, despite the growing pressure and risk facing us, our decision to maintain the stability of the yuan renminbi will remain unchanged. Fighting with one heart and one mind, we won the battle against the disastrous floods. We have taken a series of measures to deepen our reform and expand 11 domestic demand so as to ensure the sustained growth of our economy and achieve the objective of an 8 per cent rise in this year’s gross domestic product. We firmly believe that with the common efforts of the countries in the region and of the rest of the international community, the East Asian economy will be able to gradually get out of its predicament and return to the road of sound development. The Middle East peace process has been in a stalemate for some time, which has aroused widespread concern in the international community. We are of the view that the Arab nations and Israel should hold earnest and pragmatic negotiations so as to achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting peace, which will be not only in the fundamental interests of the Arab and Israeli peoples, but also conducive to world peace and stability. We hope that all the parties concerned in the Arab-Israeli disputes will take a flexible and pragmatic position to promote steady progress in the peace negotiations under the principle of land for peace and on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions and the agreements already reached. The Chinese Government will, as always, support the Middle East peace process and the efforts made by the United Nations and the relevant parties to this end. We are following the developments in the Kosovo region of Yugoslavia with concern. It is our hope that the parties involved will solve the problem through political dialogue. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia should be respected. Peace and stability in the Balkans have been hard won and should be cherished all the more by the relevant parties and by the international community. The border conflicts between Ethiopia and Eritrea and the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are another source of concern for us. It is hoped that they will be appropriately resolved by the parties involved through peaceful means. The twenty-first century is greeting us. On the threshold of the new century, the United Nations bears heavy responsibilities with regard to maintaining world peace, promoting human progress and establishing a just and rational new international political and economic order. It has an irreplaceable role to play. Above all, after the end of the cold war, the United Nations, with fewer constraints and more vitality, is confronted with unprecedented opportunities. In this context, the United Nations should and can use its own advantages to play a unique and constructive role in building a peaceful, secure and stable world, in establishing a new type of international relationship based on friendship and cooperation and in taking up the common challenges facing mankind. China has consistently held that it is necessary to carry out appropriate reform in the United Nations so that the Organization can better keep abreast of the changing situation and serve its numerous Member States. We have taken note of the initial progress of United Nations reform in a number of fields promoted by all Member States. Some reform measures and recommendations proposed by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, have been approved by the General Assembly and are now being put into practice. Intense discussions on reform of the Security Council are also in orderly progress. At present, there are still differences among Member States on quite a few issues involved in the reform of the Security Council. We hope that all parties will adopt a constructive approach and play an active part in the relevant consultations with a view to reaching a proper settlement of relevant issues. Here, I wish to reiterate the basic position of the Chinese Government on these issues. First, the reform of the Security Council bears on the interests of all countries and so requires a democratic style of work and extensive and full consultations. All Member States should have an equal right to speak on the question of the reform, and their reasonable proposals should be fully reflected. Secondly, the Security Council is not a club of rich countries. The purpose of its reform is not just to meet the concerns of a few big countries. Rather, more attention should be given to the interests and aspirations of the vast number of developing countries. Representation should be balanced between the developed and the developing countries. Thirdly, the reform measures are of major significance, as they bear on enhancing the role of the Security Council in maintaining international peace and security. They should be worked out on the basis of the realities and in the light of history. It is a matter of course that the objective of the reform of the Security Council is to solve problems rather than to create new sources of discord. In order to ensure that the reformed Security Council gains extensive support from Member States, it is essential to adhere to the principle of consensus. This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In the past 50 years, the Declaration has vigorously promoted the advancement and development of the cause 12 of human rights in the world. Vast numbers of people in Asia, Africa and Latin America freed themselves from colonial rule. The South African people rooted out the dark system of apartheid, won basic political rights and became an equal member of the international community. The United Nations, for its part, adopted a series of international instruments on human rights such as the Declaration on the Right to Development, further enriching the content of human rights. The right to development has been universally recognized in the international community as an inseparable part of basic human rights. In the meantime, earth-shaking changes have taken place in China. Especially in the past two decades, since the introduction of reform and opening up, China has witnessed an ever-improved practice of democracy, an ever-improved legal system and ever-enhanced legal protection of the rights of its people. It is perfectly obvious that the Chinese people now enjoy a higher degree of freedom and equality than ever before and a much fuller and more settled life than in the past. The Chinese Government will continue to make unremitting efforts to advance democracy and to strengthen the legal system, while developing the economy so as to better ensure that its people enjoy human rights to the full. The Chinese Government is active in supporting and participating in the activities of the United Nations in the field of human rights. China has all along stood for international cooperation in the field of human rights on the basis of equality and mutual respect, so as to enhance understanding, narrow differences, expand common ground and strengthen cooperation through dialogue. The Chinese Government is ready to engage in dialogue, exchanges and cooperation, on the basis of equality and mutual respect, with human rights organizations at the national and international levels. Last October, the Chinese Government signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. As to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, I earnestly declare here that the Chinese Government has decided to sign it early next month. This once again testifies to the resolve of the Chinese Government with respect to promoting and protecting human rights. China is ready to continue to work with other countries to maintain and increase the current positive momentum of dialogue and cooperation so as to promote the furtherance of the world cause of human rights. This year is the twentieth anniversary of the introduction of the policy of reform and opening up in China. In these two decades, China has scored tremendous achievements in its reform, opening up and modernization drive. Particularly in recent years, our national economy has gained a favourable momentum of high growth and low inflation, thanks to deepened reforms and strengthened macroeconomic regulation. Last September, the Communist Party of China, at its fifteenth National Congress, formulated a blueprint for China’s cross-century development based on the new developments both on the domestic and international scene. In March this year, our new State institutions and new Government were formed through elections at the first session of the ninth National People’s Congress of China. We will build energetically on our political and economic restructuring and carry forward the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics into the twenty-first century in a comprehensive way. China’s modernization drive requires a stable international environment of peace. China will continue to pursue its independent foreign policy of peace. This policy is sustained by three pillars: to persist in independence and maintain the initiative, to safeguard world peace, and to seek common development. To persist in independence and maintain the initiative, we always put our State sovereignty and national security first and never develop relations with other countries at the expense of our own sovereignty. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s sacred territory. The successful return of Hong Kong and the upcoming return of Macao will undoubtedly provide useful inspiration and create favourable conditions for the settlement of the Taiwan question. We will, as always, adhere to the basic policy of peaceful reunification and one country/two systems; adhere to President Jiang Zemin’s eight-point proposal on developing cross-Strait relations and promoting the process of peaceful reunification of the motherland; expand cross-Strait exchanges and cooperation in various fields; and resolutely oppose the creation of the “independence of Taiwan”, “two Chinas” and “one China/one, Taiwan” and Taiwan’s attempt to re-enter the United Nations. We respect the sovereignty of other countries and vigorously support the efforts of all countries in the world, and of developing countries in particular, to defend their State sovereignty, while firmly safeguarding our own. In handling international relations, we adhere to non-alignment, non-confrontation and the non-targeting of Third States. We do not go in for military blocs and the 13 arms race, nor do we engage in military expansion. China’s development will not pose a threat to any other country. The so-called “China threat” is entirely unfounded and fabricated with ulterior motives. To safeguard world peace, China is a staunch force for the maintenance of world peace and regional stability. It is our consistent view that State-to-State relations should be handled in a spirit of mutual respect and peaceful coexistence, transcending differences in social systems and ideologies. Countries should safeguard their own interests and, at the same time, respect those of others and continuously expand mutually beneficial cooperation by seeking the convergent points of common interests. With regard to existing differences and disputes, it is necessary to persist in dialogue, not engage in confrontation, and strive to settle them by peaceful means rather than by resorting to force or the threat of force. It is essential to completely reject the mentality of the cold war, advocate a new security concept and resolve international and regional security issues through consensus and participation on an equal footing. We in China stand for the equality of all countries, big or small, and for accelerated democratization of international relations. World affairs should be handled through consultation by all countries, and no country should impose its own will on others. To seek common development, peace is the prerequisite of development and development is the basis of peace. In today’s world, where the economy is increasingly globalized, countries must pursue an open policy in order to achieve economic growth. Opening up to the outside world is China’s long-standing basic State policy. As a huge emerging market, China will strive to keep abreast of the trend of economic globalization and be even more active in opening up to the world. It is ready to develop trade and expand scientific and technological exchanges with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit and in the interest of common progress. It attaches importance to and actively participates in the activities of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC) and the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) and sets store by the establishment and development of friendly exchanges and cooperation with other global and intercontinental or regional organizations for economic cooperation. China continues to take a positive attitude towards joining the World Trade Organization (WTO). Thanks to unremitting efforts over a decade, China is already qualified for entry. Regrettably, however, the relevant negotiations have dragged on and on with no decision having been made. China is a developing country, and we can negotiate China’s entry into the WTO only on this basis, in accordance with the principle of balancing rights and obligations. It is our hope that the countries concerned will take a practical, fair and flexible attitude, give up excessive demands and work for an early conclusion of the relevant negotiations. China’s joining the WTO will benefit all its members and make the multilateral trade mechanism complete and more balanced. Before I conclude my speech, please allow me to use the forum of the United Nations to brief you on China’s flood-fighting and disaster-relief efforts. Owing to such factors as abnormal climate changes this year, catastrophic floods swept along the Yangtze, Nenjiang, Songhua and other rivers of China. The sheer size of the submerged regions, the duration of the floods and the seriousness of the disaster they caused were something rarely seen before. Giving top priority to the protection of people’s lives and their safety, the Chinese Government mobilized forces from all sectors across the country and organized millions of soldiers and civilians for an all-out battle against the floods and for disaster relief. Thus, the assaults of flood crests were repelled again and again; the safety of the main dykes, the main transport arteries and major cities along the rivers was ensured; and the loss of life and property was kept to a minimum. At present, the Chinese Government is sparing no effort to resettle the people affected by the flood and has started reconstruction projects in the disaster areas. We are taking every measure possible, with full confidence, to ensure that there will be no famine and no widespread epidemic diseases in the wake of the natural disaster and that none of the pupils or students in the flood-hit areas will drop out from school or be deprived of education. In the course of reconstruction, we will carry forward the great flood-fighting spirit in an all-round endeavour to push forward our reform and opening up and the socialist modernization drive. Since China was hit by the disastrous floods, a number of countries and international organizations and communities have sent messages to express sympathy and solicitude, and rendered support and assistance to China. I wish to take this opportunity to extend, on behalf of the Chinese Government and people, our most sincere gratitude to them. The world of today is a world of interdependence. The promotion of peace, cooperation and development has 14 become the main trend of the times. Let us join hands and work together to bring into the twenty-first century a world of peace, security and stability in the interest of development.  Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session and to assure you of the full support of the delegation of Kazakhstan in your work. Kazakhstan, in welcoming the efforts of the Secretary-General to reform the United Nations, supports the decisions adopted by the General Assembly at its last session. The steps taken in that direction will undoubtedly facilitate the renewal of the Organization in the changing historical conditions. On the threshold of the twenty-first century, the world is becoming an integrated and interrelated system in which there is no room for autarchy and self-isolation. Globalization, which embraces the main spheres of human activity, has radically altered the accustomed assumptions about the realities of modern life. Globalization also compels us to reassess the nature of international cooperation from the standpoint of strengthening multilateral mechanisms for taking decisions on the urgent problems that are of concern to the entire world 17 community. Despite all the diversity of national interests, such decisions need to be taken through joint efforts on the basis of goodwill and consensus, and here the role of the United Nations cannot be underestimated. On the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we again note the permanent significance of that instrument in affirming democratic values and the rule of law. Kazakhstan, seven years after making its choice of democracy and an open society, is today taking tangible steps to intensify its political reforms. Our country is embarking on a comprehensive programme of democratization that covers such important spheres as elections, political parties, Parliament, civil society, the judicial system, the advancement of women and the mass media. The President of Kazakhstan, Mr. Nursultan Nazarbaev, will be taking decisive steps to solve acute social problems, combat corruption and optimize the State administration. All these measures are aimed at further protecting and guaranteeing the rights and freedoms of every citizen of our multi-ethnic society. We shall do everything within our power to preserve such values as inter-ethnic harmony and the diversity of the cultures and customs of each of the nationalities that make up the people of Kazakhstan. We shall strengthen pluralism in society in order reliably to guarantee the freedoms of conscience, speech and the press and further to strengthen the foundations of a secular democratic society. Kazakhstan does not believe that it is possible to build its own statehood without successful integration into the world economy and world politics. In this context, we are developing and strengthening our national financial institutions, which has enabled us to cope, at lower cost, with the consequences of the crisis affecting Asia and the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). As a proponent of a policy of integration, our head of State is a constant advocate of creating the appropriate economic conditions for this to take place and has proposed, as Chairman of the Customs Union, the conclusion of a treaty on the creation of a unified economic space within the CIS. Kazakhstan, which pursues a policy of constructive cooperation, has created a zone of security and goodneighbourliness around its borders. We are not in confrontation with any State in the world. As a Eurasian State, Kazakhstan sees the development of friendly, equitable and mutually beneficial relations with the countries of the East and the West as a priority of its foreign policy. We believe that Kazakhstan’s voluntary renunciation of its nuclear heritage and its firm adherence to the nonproliferation regime constitute important prerequisites for the attainment of this strategic objective. A few days ago, the second International Conference on the problems of non-proliferation was held in the town of Kurchatov, which is within the territory of the former nuclear testingground at Semipalatinsk. During the conference, the last strategic missile launch silo was shut down. Kazakhstan consistently advocates the creation of security structures on the Asian continent. We note with satisfaction that the initiative of our country’s President to convene a conference on interaction and confidencebuilding measures in Asia is taking solid shape and becoming a tangible factor in present-day international life. This is attested to by the meeting which took place in Almaty in July of the leaders of Kazakhstan, China, the Russian Federation, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan on issues of cooperation and confidence-building measures in the region. We believe that the agreements signed with China on the delimitation of the Kazakh-Chinese border will make a major contribution to strengthening regional security and stability. The Kazakh-Russian Declaration on eternal friendship and alliance for the twenty-first century and the Treaty of eternal friendship between Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan are also of great importance. Kazakhstan, as a firm proponent of strengthening regional and global security, strongly condemns any undermining of the non-proliferation regime and calls on India and Pakistan to heed the views of the vast majority of the world community and accede without delay to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We support the call of the Secretary-General of the United Nations for those countries to join in the negotiations on prohibitions of the production of fissionable materials for nuclear weapons and to refrain from deploying such weapons in their territory. In the context of strengthening regional security and the non-proliferation regime, Kazakhstan will continue to work for the creation of a nuclear-weaponfree zone in Central Asia. The demonstrations of our country’s involvement in the peacekeeping activities of the United Nations include 18 the formation of a peacekeeping battalion in Central Asia and Kazakhstan’s participation in the United Nations standby arrangements system. From this high podium, we cannot fail to pay attention to the current situation in Afghanistan. The events taking place there, which are accompanied by mass violations of human rights and the fundamental norms of international law, have become a subject of profound concern to us. Kazakhstan has made and will continue to make its contribution to the achievement of peace in that country. The task of the world community is to convince all the parties to the conflict to cease military action right away and sit down at the negotiating table with a view to establishing a Government of national reconciliation. We are convinced that no military solution to the Afghan problem exists. A peace process in Afghanistan is possible only if interference from outside is halted and full support is given to the efforts of the Secretary-General. Not only immediate neighbours, but all interested countries, must take an active part in the search for ways of solving the Afghan problem. One of the most difficult present-day problems is international terrorism and organized crime. Kazakhstan rejects terrorism in all its manifestations and is ready to participate in international efforts to combat this evil. On the threshold of the next century, a handful of madmen cannot be allowed to blackmail and endanger the lives and well-being of people who uphold the ideas of creation and peace. This is doubly dangerous in the case of nuclear terrorism. International organized crime is associated in one way or another with illegal drug-trafficking. Most unfortunately, the scale of the drug business is constantly growing. Drug addiction, moving freely across borders, is undermining statehood and the moral foundations of society. Increasingly, more young people are becoming addicted to drugs. We are witnessing a new phenomenon of drug production becoming a leading component of national economies. Drugs from Afghanistan are to be found in virtually all countries of the world. Accordingly, we support the decisions of the twentieth special session of the General Assembly on international drug control and will participate actively in their implementation. In speaking of the main problems that ail mankind, we cannot forget separatism. Kazakhstan has more than once stated its position that it does not accept ethnic separatism. Given the calamities it is inflicting on many States, now is the time to declare unambiguously that separatism must be proclaimed outside the law. The right of nations to selfdetermination cannot under present historical circumstances play the role that it played at the beginning of this century. Yet another global problem which casts a cloud over the future of mankind is the ever deteriorating environmental situation. Kazakhstan has in all truth experienced the consequences of environmental disasters. From this high podium, the President of Kazakhstan has more than once called on the world community to unify and coordinate efforts to protect the environment. We are grateful to the General Assembly for the support that has been extended to our country, as reflected in the resolution on assistance in overcoming the consequences of the nuclear tests in the Semipalatinsk region. The Aral Sea disaster has become genuinely global in nature. Deposits of salt from the exposed bed of the Aral Sea have been found in the Arctic Ocean and in Western Europe. While noting with gratitude the assistance from the United Nations, we nevertheless call on the States Members of our Organization to pay greater attention to this serious problem and to take more active and specific steps to solve it. The peculiarity of the geographical situation of Kazakhstan, and of Central Asia as a whole, confronts us with an acute problem of access to world markets, including the transport of hydrocarbons. Kazakhstan therefore attaches great importance to cooperation with the United Nations and its specialized agencies to develop transit transport systems in the landlocked Central Asian States. Reviving the traditions of the Great Silk Road, Kazakhstan is interested in expanding and developing transportation networks in Central Asia and beyond. Our country, with its vast territory, is an important link between Asia and Europe. Our participation in the Transport Corridor: Europe-Caucasus-Asia (TRACECA) project will undoubtedly facilitate an increase in the effectiveness of the transport system in the vast area of the Eurasian continent. We place great hopes in the United Nations Special Programme for the Economies of Central Asia (SPECA), recently adopted by the Economic Commission for Europe and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. 19 Kazakhstan, as the Chairman of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), intends to make a real contribution to stepping up the activity of this important regional forum. The Declaration and other documents adopted at the ECO summit in Almaty creates good prerequisites for the creation of a favourable trade climate in relations between the ECO member countries and their potential partners in Europe and Asia. We believe that ECO is a promising organization and has great potential for expanding economic ties in the territories of 10 States with a total population of more than 300 million people. Kazakhstan will work for the further strengthening of cooperation between the ECO and the United Nations. Another issue that must be included among today’s urgent problems is the legal status of the Caspian Sea. We note with satisfaction the progress made in reaching consensus on this complex and delicate subject, which affects the interrelations among the five littoral States. The agreement signed between Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation in July this year on the delimitation of the northern part of the Caspian Sea lays the foundations for a complete settlement of the Caspian problem. It is now important to take concrete steps for the implementation of this instrument, which is in conformity with the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. A solution of the Caspian problem is of strategic importance for Kazakhstan. We are interested in reliably ensuring the export of our mineral resources through multiple-option oil-gas pipelines. We expect early implementation of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium project, and we believe that the construction of an oil pipeline from western Kazakhstan to China offers promising prospects. We support the trans-Caspian project for an oil and gas pipeline, Baku-Ceyhan, and we view the project for an oil pipeline through the territory of Iran as very promising. It must be noted with regret that mankind will be entering the next century burdened by many serious problems. But, at the same time, there are no grounds for unrelieved pessimism, since the passing century, which witnessed two world wars, the development and testing of lethal types of weapons and a multiplicity of regional and ethnic conflicts, has developed reliable mechanisms — our Organization first among them — for preventing and settling international problems. The cause of peace, security and development is of concern to all States. We must, therefore, all act as a united whole. Kazakhstan is ready to take part in this work for peace and cooperation.   May I start, Sir, by congratulating Mr. Opertti on his election as President of this great Assembly, and wishing him well as he guides its deliberations. I was privileged to visit his country, Uruguay, earlier this year, and appreciated the warmth and hospitality on that occasion. I would also like to express our thanks to his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, who, with considerable commitment, presided over the introduction of many important reform measures during the past session. Each year this debate provides an opportunity to take a longer perspective on the United Nations — to look back and, of course, to look ahead. We have achievements to acknowledge and challenges for the future to consider. In doing so, our view is informed by present-day conditions. We are living in very difficult times. The economic events that have unfolded over the last year, initially in Asia, now show signs of having a global impact. They will affect developed and developing countries alike across most regions of the world. The problems that face us demand a calm and steady response if financial troubles are not to spill over into wider instability. This presents a direct challenge to us all, and a test of the component parts of the multilateral system. This year we mark 50-year milestones in two major areas of United Nations work, two areas that distinguish this half-century from earlier times: international peacekeeping and the development of international human rights law. Both have a part to play in responding to the challenges of the present day. Both typify the unique contribution of the United Nations system. It is in this global setting that universal international norms can be established. The international rule of law gives us a framework with which to deal confidently with the 7 problems that confront us. And it is through collective security that the countries of the world can work together to promote and reinforce peace and stability. New Zealand, as a small country, has from the outset valued the opportunities for global debate and collective action provided by the United Nations. We are committed to the strengthening of that system. We believe its effective operation is essential to the well-being of our world. We are, of course, as many are, conscious of the criticisms that have been levelled at the United Nations in recent years. Ten years ago the United Nations stock was very high. The end of the cold war was seen as heralding a new age. In 1988 the United Nations peacekeeping forces were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. At the turn of the decade there was talk of a new world order. But the world community?s expectations of what could be achieved sometimes exceeded Member States? own political will to deliver. And the United Nations machinery, which had grown and expanded to meet world expectations, proved too cumbersome — and often very costly — to respond effectively. Euphoria about the United Nations began to give way to cynicism. One editorial writer this year referred to the United Nations as “a busted flush”. But when we take a longer view it is clear that neither euphoria nor cynicism is the appropriate reaction. Since the end of the cold war the United Nations peacekeeping machinery has been used as never before. There have been some marked successes and, regrettably, some failures. Much has been learned. Future peacekeeping mandates must reflect the lessons learned. The need for the United Nations to be able to carry out its peacekeeping role remains. Its successes point to what it can achieve. But today fewer troops are wearing the blue beret, and troop-contributing countries do not receive timely reimbursement. The largest contributor?s arrears in peacekeeping and the regular budget cast a long shadow over the Organization. Dues outstanding at present have reached alarming proportions. This affects all — large nations and small nations. We cannot afford to have the capacity of the United Nations restricted by this constant budget uncertainty. In my own area of the South Pacific we developed a regional response to a regional problem. I am referring to the island of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea, an island which was ravaged by civil war for nine years but has enjoyed peace for the last 12 months. It was the Governments of the region that set out to help the Government of Papua New Guinea and representatives of the Bougainville people to bring this horror to an end. The contributions of Australia, Fiji, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and my own country have played a valuable and significant role, and there is now growing hope and confidence on Bougainville — rare commodities for almost a decade. The Lincoln Agreement, signed in Christchurch, New Zealand, in January, while formalizing the ceasefire, paved the way also for United Nations participation. We welcomed the United Nations decision to set up a small political office on the island. This commitment by the United Nations will help strengthen the peace process there. Today the world faces uncertainty caused by the financial turmoil which began in Asia. It is affecting the Russian Federation, is putting many countries in Latin America under pressure and is now touching just about everybody. The sudden plunge in investor confidence and the reversal of developing markets? short capital flows has dramatically changed economic and social prospects. World economic growth this year will be significantly reduced. This most serious economic situation in many years has the potential to intrude upon all of our lives. We must cooperate to turn this crisis around. And at the national level we must take the actions required, not just for our own sakes but in the interests of the broader international community. This includes refraining from protectionist reactions, which could only exacerbate it, and pushing ahead with liberalization of markets wherever possible. A serious challenge is to ensure that economic insecurity does not threaten political and social stability. We must resist pressures to take political actions that we would normally avoid. The best way to achieve this is through a collective approach to the problems that confront us; to strengthen our multilateral institutions in the United Nations system and elsewhere and build confidence in our joint ability to work through difficult times. I was particularly struck by the comments of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on these matters in his statement on Monday. His characterization of the 8 crisis — that it is not just financial or economic or social or political, but all of these things at once — is exactly right. I thoroughly endorse the Secretary-General?s conclusion that we must address the crisis on all these fronts. As a forum for debate, and as a body capable of taking global action, the United Nations, together with its specialized agencies, has an important role to play in building capacity and providing social support where it is needed. Much of what the United Nations has achieved provides the norms and mechanisms to help us through difficult times of the sort we are facing right now. The challenge for the Organization is to act decisively to tackle the problems that have the potential to undermine our security, problems that have their greatest impact on ordinary people in developing countries. Now is not the time to go backwards. Recent tragic events in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam have underlined that the fight against terrorism is far from over. The response to terrorism must be decisive and unequivocal. The international community has a duty to ensure that there are no safe havens for terrorist groups. Universal commitment to the network of anti-terrorist instruments must be a fundamental objective of all Members of this Organization. War crimes and crimes against humanity have seen a resurgence in this last part of the twentieth century. New Zealand supports the work of the ad hoc war crimes Tribunals in bringing criminals to justice. But this is not enough. New Zealand has long called for an international criminal court that would have jurisdiction over such crimes. We commend the effort of those who, through much hard work, dedication and compromise, enabled the Statute for the International Criminal Court to be adopted. It is our expectation that, with the support of the international community, the Court will prove an effective tool in the fight against those who carry out appalling atrocities. Nowhere is the need for multilateral action more clearly obvious than in our efforts to halt environmental degradation and promote sustainable development. New Zealand is honoured to have our own Environment Minister, the Honourable Simon Upton, chair the Commission on Sustainable Development for its seventh session. It is our strong hope that this session will see us advance Agenda 21, and take further steps towards achieving the goals set at the Rio Earth Summit six years ago. It is appropriate that in the United Nations Year of the Ocean the session?s themes will include oceans and seas and the review of the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States in preparation for next year?s special session of the General Assembly. The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted last December was a positive first step in dealing with this quintessentially global problem. There remain some important implementation issues to be resolved. The Fourth Congress of the parties in Buenos Aires will provide an opportunity to make further progress. Thanks to the commitment of the Secretary-General, we now have an Organization that is efficient and effective. There is more to be done if this great Organization is to meet the challenges of the present day: changes that make it possible to redirect efforts from the administration of the Organization to its front-line work in development and confronting global problems. New Zealand looks forward to continuing the dialogue on financing for development. Through our current membership of the Economic and Social Council we have followed closely the evolving debate on this very important issue. We very much welcome the initiatives taken by the Organization towards closer linkages with the Bretton Woods Institutions. Those institutions are themselves at the forefront of the effort to tackle the present economic crisis, probably the greatest challenge they have ever had. However, we must decide whether in their present form they are appropriate for the twenty-first century. This Organization, too, like any other, needs to respond to changing circumstances, and be flexible enough to meet new challenges. It must reflect the world of today, not stay fixed in the patterns of earlier times. The East-West conflict is well behind us. We now need to address anew the divide between North and South. The United Nations development role is crucial. Once again I believe the Secretary-General hit the nail on the head when he described in his statement on Monday the need to restore development to its proper place in global economic strategy. Also essential are measures to free up trade and investment flows, and promote access to information and technology. All of these are tools with which to fight the economic downturn which is confronting us. 9 The United Nations clearly has the leading role to play in development. Other international institutions play a complementary part. I am personally conscious of the particular contribution made by the Commonwealth through the recent Commonwealth Small States Mission. That Mission highlighted the special vulnerability of small States, which has led to the establishment of the Commonwealth/World Bank task force on the issue which will have relevance to the work of the Economic and Social Council and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) on the question of vulnerability. Within the United Nations we need to correct the North-South imbalance to which I referred through reform of the Security Council. More equitable representation on the Council would better reflect the world as it is and today?s United Nations. Expansion is proving a complex issue, but there has been some good progress this year in the equally important area of reforming the Council?s working methods. Altogether, these are matters which require careful consideration and negotiation. Setting artificial deadlines ahead of general agreement on a reform package would not be helpful and could in fact prove damaging to the Organization. Any reforms must enjoy the support of the greatest possible number of Member States. I should add that regional groups in the United Nations still reflect an earlier era. New Zealand is certainly open to new ideas on how groupings can be reorganized to create a more equitable distribution of electoral opportunities and to recognize modern-day political and economic linkages. In the field of disarmament and arms control, it is timely to consider how far we have come and what we have achieved. The adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996 certainly promised the end of nuclear testing. But the global non-proliferation norm was shattered by the nuclear testing in South Asia, raising grave fears of a potential arms race. New Zealand has taken some encouragement from statements made in this Hall in recent days, and hopes that 1999 will be the year in which all countries that have not yet done so will sign up unconditionally to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The Conference on Disarmament has now agreed to proceed with negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty. New Zealand wants to see those negotiations concluded as soon as possible. There must be no stepping back from the objective of complete disarmament, including the elimination of nuclear weapons. New Zealand?s commitment to this objective was reiterated in the declaration which I, together with the Foreign Ministers of seven other countries, issued on 9 June. New Zealand is now working with those countries on a draft resolution based on the concerns outlined in the declaration. One achievement which I personally see as a top priority for 1999 is the conclusion of a verification protocol to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction. Following a very successful initiative from Australia, I was pleased to chair a group of ministers who this week issued a statement urging Governments to commit themselves to completing this task. New Zealand supports the actions of the United Nations to ensure the elimination of Iraq?s stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction and the threat they pose to the security of the region. We urge the Government of Iraq to resume cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission so that the elimination of these dreadful weapons can be confirmed. Then the Security Council can once more address the question of lifting sanctions. In the 50 years since Member States adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the significance of the Declaration has been demonstrated time and time again. Yet there remains much to be done before the vision in the Charter and in the Declaration can be realized for all. We are confident that, under the leadership of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, we will continue to make good progress towards the realization of that vision. The United Nations can add value in promoting and protecting fundamental human rights standards, emphasizing practical capacity-building efforts. We have been supporting the High Commissioner?s efforts in this area, and we will continue to do so. We see countries in all regions of the world seeking the international community?s support as they build structures to provide good governance and deliver hope and greater well-being to their people. In particular, I am encouraged by developments in Nigeria and in Sierra Leone in this regard. As the last 50 years have demonstrated, this Organization has added a whole new dimension to 10 cooperation among nations. No lesser body could have achieved so much. In the longer perspective of history it will be the dramatic development of the international rule of law and the evolution of collective approaches to security, both political and economic, which will characterize our era. In other words, that really is the work of the United Nations. Now, with the challenge of the economic problems that face us, we nations of the world are more dependent than ever on solving our shared problems together. New Zealand therefore rededicates itself to the United Nations and to the ideals that this Organization stands for.  I should like first of all to carry out the noble duty of adding my voice to those who have spoken before me from this rostrum in congratulating Mr. Didier Opertti on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third regular session. I am convinced that with the effective cooperation of the elected members of his Bureau, he will spare no effort to ensure the success of our work. I should also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for the skill with which he so honourably discharged his weighty responsibilities as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session. The fifty-third session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when my country, the Democratic 24 Republic of the Congo, is the victim of armed aggression by its neighbours, Rwanda and Uganda, that has been taking place since 2 August. The seriousness of the actions of these two invading countries, which are States parties to the noble ideals of the charters of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity (OUA), obliges me to dwell at length on this dispute in the hope of helping the Assembly understand better the drama that is currently taking place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, my dear homeland. In order to enable the Assembly better to understand this war and all of its consequences, a brief reminder of the facts is necessary. On 27 July 1998, the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mzee Laurent-Désiré Kabila, after consultations with his Rwandan and Ugandan counterparts took the sovereign decision to terminate Rwanda’s military and technical cooperation and to put an end to the presence of foreign troops throughout the national territory. When Rwanda’s troops left Congolese territory, it was noticed that certain Tutsis of Rwandan origin, called Banyamulenge, followed suit. A week later, Congolese towns bordering on Rwanda — Goma, Bukavu and Uvira — were seized by armed elements that came from that neighbouring country. On 6 August, aircraft started shuttling between Goma and Kitona, in the west of the country, via Kigali, over a distance of more than 2000 kilometres. After one of the civilian pilots was killed for refusing to carry out orders, these aircraft were diverted from Goma airport to transport troops and matériel the west, under the direction of Mr. James Kabarehe, the ex-Chief of Staff of the Congo. At the same time, columns of armoured vehicles and other military equipment crossed the border from Uganda under the pretext of defending Ugandan interests in the Congo. Despite the protests of the Congolese Government, which demanded their immediate withdrawal, Ugandan troops surrounded the town of Bunia in the eastern part of the country on 13 August 1998. On the same day, the Inga hydroelectric dam was occupied by the Rwandan-Ugandan coalition forces. They sabotaged the installations in order to deprive the capital, Kinshasa, of electricity and drinking water. On 23 August 1998, Ugandan troops attacked Kisangani, in the north-eastern part of the country, and later occupied it. These facts, and these acts of violence — confirmed by independent sources — provide ample proof of the aggressive involvement of Kigali and Kampala in the huge plot to Balkanize the Democratic Republic of the Congo, all in defiance of international law and the principle of the inviolability of borders inherited from the colonial period, pursuant to the Charter of the Organization of African Unity. Indeed, one of the two aggressor countries, Uganda, made no bones about admitting publicly that its troops occupied certain positions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. As can be seen, what some media sources wrongly described as a rebellion from the east was simply a shameful plot to destabilize my country politically and economically, and the covetous intentions of Rwanda and Uganda regarding my country’s many natural resources were barely concealed. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is once again paying a high price for this war imposed on it from the outside. Among the countless examples are the massacres of thousands of innocent Congolese, including members of religious orders, women, children and elderly people in the east and in the west. These sordid crimes remind us of the killing of Hutu refugees by elements of the same Rwandan Patriotic Army. Further examples include the massive deportations from Kivu towards Rwanda of people whose fate remains unknown; the summary executions of prisoners of war; the dismantling, sabotage and destruction of the industrial, shipping and economic infrastructure of the country, damage which, to date, has been estimated at about $3 billion for Matadi alone; the more than three-week cut in the provision of electric power and water to the capital, Kinshasa, a city of more than 6 million people, which was a real humanitarian tragedy, as is illustrated by the fact that large stocks of fresh foodstuffs were declared unfit for consumption; reports of countless deaths in the hospitals because doctors were unable to work in the conditions required by their noble profession; and the postponement, sine die, of the polio vaccination campaign mandated by the World Health Organization, with untold consequences on the lives of our children, which gravely compromises the future of our country. 25 Despite the situation of aggression, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is a peace-loving nation that respects international conventions reaffirms its commitment to the principles of the Charter and its unshakeable faith in the promotion of a culture of peace in the Great Lakes region. The first manifestation of this ideal was demonstrated by the Government when it appealed to the Security Council and the Secretary-General to obtain the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces. Unfortunately, the reaction of the international community did not match the gravity of the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Even one of the most important bodies in the United Nations system — the Security Council — after much procrastination, merely issued a few ambiguous statements calling for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of foreign troops without, unfortunately, specifying them by name. On the other hand, in similar cases — in Kosovo, in Bosnia and in Kuwait — the Security Council dealt with the situation promptly and practically to restore peace. Why was there this silence from the international community, particularly from Security Council? The Council’s policy of double standards on this issue could set an unfortunate precedent that could seriously undermine the credibility of the United Nations and wipe out the reform efforts under way. Given this situation that does no credit to our community, the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, mindful of its heavy responsibilities to guarantee the territorial integrity of the country, was obliged to resort to an armed response to put an end to the invasion. Pursuant to Article 51 of the Charter, the Democratic Republic of the Congo appealed to its allies to deal with Ugandan-Rwandan aggression. I would like to take this opportunity to thank member countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), in particular, Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe, which responded to our appeal. I would also like to pay tribute to the valiant Congolese people, who undertook to defend their homeland when it was under attack. I am also grateful to Belgium, which had the courage to publicly condemn a country in the Great Lakes region that was involved in this act of aggression, and to Ms. Colette Braeckman, who had the courage to denounce the plot against my country, as well as Chad, Gabon and many other African countries that publicly demonstrated their support and denounced this aggression. The Assembly will agree with me that no honourable nation can allow its sovereignty and territorial integrity to be called into question. The Congolese people will never accept subjugation, oppression or the imposition of perverse values such as a cultural genocide, which is so blithely tolerated by certain States. The International Criminal Court whose Statute was signed recently in Rome should get down to work and immediately prosecute those who seek the destruction of human beings but who cover up their actions by making innocent people take the blame. The failure of the various appeals for a ceasefire cannot be blamed on the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is rather the result of the obstinacy, bad faith and cynicism of Rwanda and Uganda during the negotiations held in Victoria Falls and in Addis Ababa. Since the first summit, held at Victoria Falls last August, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has indicated that implementation of the ceasefire was contingent on the immediate, unconditional withdrawal from our national territory of foreign troops not invited by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I believe that the General Assembly and the Security Council are obligated properly to implement the relevant provisions of the Charter, in particular those of Chapter VII, which envision action by the world Organization with respect to threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and acts of aggression. Despite the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, our Government continues to abide by the timetable leading to the democratization of our political life. In that connection, I wish to inform the Assembly that on 22 September 1998 our head of State signed Law 122, relating to the organization and exercise of power in my country. The new law grants the Constitutional Commission prerogatives allocated to the Constituent Assembly, finalizing the draft constitution to be the subject of a referendum that will be organized early in 1999. I reassure the international community that my country has noble aspirations and to date has granted no material or military support whatsoever to the former Rwandese Armed Forces, to the Interahamwe extremists, or much less to the Front pour la défense de la démocratie, contrary to the campaign of slander and incitement waged by aggressors wishing to absolve 26 themselves of the massacre of more than a thousand people in and around Kasika. I cannot conclude without speaking of the rebuilding of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in particular and of the need for socio-economic development in Africa in general; the continent continues to face crises of all kinds and is trying in vain to meet the challenge of recovery. In this context, the role of the United Nations should not be limited to accompanying Africa in implementing measures that have been or will be adopted. Through capacity- building, the United Nations system must translate into fact the organic partnership between itself and the Organization of African Unity. In the case of my country, the war imposed upon it by its neighbours has destroyed what remained of its economic fabric, which had long suffered from the economic mismanagement of the former dictatorship. That is why I appeal urgently to the United Nations and more specifically to the “Friends of the Congo” — which at the Brussels conference decided to provide the assistance needed to rebuild the Democratic Republic of the Congo — to contribute to the trust fund established for that purpose, with a view to helping in the economic recovery and the rebuilding of my country. I wish in conclusion to say that my country would appreciate enormously any action that the United Nations might consider to prevail upon the Rwandese Republic to sign the non-aggression pact among the members of the Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa, and to establish democracy in Rwanda and Uganda. For all my country’s problems are repercussions of the policy of non-democratization in Rwanda and in Uganda. The international community would thus be performing a useful task.Allow me, Sir, to join preceding speakers in congratulating Mr. Opertti and the members of the Bureau on their well-deserved election, and to wish them every success in discharging their duties. May I also take this opportunity to express my delegation?s deep appreciation to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine for his outstanding stewardship of the work of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly. One of the pressing issues that mankind is facing today is globalization and the growing interdependence of States and their effects on international relations. These objective processes will to a great extent determine the nature of international relations at the outset of the coming millennium. They open up enormous opportunities and at the same time are fraught with grave challenges. So far, the future does not seem to be bright for some, especially for the least developed, the weak and the vulnerable, which could result in an even wider gap between the rich and the poor, between nations and within them. The increasing interdependence of States and its effects are clearly demonstrated by the Asian financial crisis, which spilled over to some other parts of the world, adversely affecting the world economy, exacting high economic and social costs and raising serious concerns about the operations of financial markets. We believe that the present financial crisis calls for the international community to create a crisis early warning system. Therefore, naturally, these issues are on the minds of peoples and on the agenda of this Assembly. We believe that the high-level meetings held last week in this Assembly will provide a good basis for serious, constructive and fruitful debate and decisions on these issues. After decades of virtual isolation from world development, Mongolia is taking active measures to integrate itself into the global economy on the basis of whatever comparative advantage it has. Though concrete steps have been taken in the past few years, including opening up its economy to the outside world and joining the World Trade Organization, the negative consequences of globalization, which are felt especially by the weak and vulnerable, including by the landlocked developing countries, risk marginalizing it economically, if not politically. We therefore believe that the world community, when searching for adequate responses to globalization, should take into account the challenges that these vulnerable States and those in transition are facing and take measures to facilitate their adaptation to the changing realities. 21 We believe that the international community should pay increasing attention to the situation of landlocked developing States. They are handicapped by their geographical location and remoteness from world markets, which, as experts point out, curtails their annual growth by 1 to 3 per cent at the very least. It is no wonder that of the 30 landlocked developing countries, 16 are among the least developed, with per capita gross domestic product of less than $400. The progressive marginalization of those countries is evident from the fact that the 300 million people who live in those countries share only 0.5 per cent of world trade, with the trend moving towards further decrease. Like other landlocked developing countries, Mongolia is taking measures to overcome the difficulties inherent to landlocked countries by closely cooperating with itstransit neighbours. In this regard, Mongolia is looking forward to concluding a subregional agreement with Russia and China that would facilitate transit transportation for all three countries and the subregion in general. Bearing in mind the state of the world?s economy and the role that the United Nations could play, Mongolia supports the efforts to increase the role of the United Nations in economic and social development, especially of weak and vulnerable States, and in creating an effective mechanism of international cooperation for development. Likewise, it is in favour of convening international conferences on development financing and on partnership for development. Mongolia believes that the notion of development should not be limited only to economic growth. In this regard, we fully agree with the wider notion that is reflected in the human development reports. Economic development, like other human activities, is directly connected to the state of the world?s environment — in fact, with the future of mankind. In many countries, especially those that are environmentally vulnerable, the question of protecting the environment is directly linked to their security and even ultimate survival. The changes in the world climate, its caprices that we see and feel, lead us to believe that greater attention and efforts are needed to cope with this ever growing and creeping danger, the effects of which are incalculable. Therefore, we believe that the first International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction should be followed by a second decade with greater focus on reaching the targets set forth, as well as strengthening existing mechanisms and creating, where necessary, new international mechanisms. Mongolia, following its centuries-old tradition of living in harmony with nature and the environment, declared 15 per cent of its territory — an area larger than Central Europe — a protected natural reserve. In the near future that area will comprise one third of its vast territory. Political stability is essential for economic development and fruitful cooperation. The end of the cold war was an important milestone in international relations that raises hopes for further strengthening peace and developing cooperation among nations. However, the post-cold-war years have vividly demonstrated that peace and stability need constant efforts by States to deepen mutual trust and to settle disputes by political means. Though some political flashpoints have been eliminated and problems solved, new ones are still arising. As reflected in the general debate the situations in the Middle East, in the Balkans and in southern Africa are causing concern on the part of the international community. Mongolia supports solving those problems on the basis of negotiation, in the spirit of cooperation, without the use or threat of force. In this connection, we would like to reiterate that the Korean peninsula should be turned into a zone of peace, stability and prosperity in the interests of the Korean people, as well as the peace and security of North-East Asia. In another part of the Asian continent, in South Asia, the international community was shocked by nuclear tests that could exacerbate tensions and undermine the existing nuclear non-proliferation regime and the test ban. Mongolia, situated between two nuclear Powers, stands strongly against any nuclear tests and, like other countries, expressed its deep concern and regret over the recent tests. Therefore, we welcome the declaration of the People?s Republic of China not to resume nuclear tests and express the hope that the latest encouraging signals from Pakistan and India will lead to strengthening the non-proliferation regime and moving closer to the objectives of nuclear disarmament. In this respect, Mongolia supports the eight-Power Declaration entitled “Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: the need for a new agenda”. Likewise, we express the hope that the negotiations on banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices will soon lead to the conclusion of a verifiable international treaty. Mongolia believes that non-nuclear-weapon States can, in their own way, contribute to strengthening nuclear security and enhance stability. In this context, it welcomes 22 and supports the efforts of the Central Asian States to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in their region. For its part, Mongolia is working to institutionalize its nuclear- weapon-free status, which would turn its territory into an area of peace, stability and predictability. All nuclear- weapon States, as well as the entire Non-Aligned Movement, fully support Mongolia?s efforts to institutionalize its nuclear-weapon-free status. Mongolia is in favour of strengthening the arms control and verification regimes set up by the Conventions on chemical and biological weapons. They will, in our view, given a genuine will to enforce them, strengthen international security. Likewise, Mongolia supports international efforts to curb the spread of conventional weapons, especially of small arms and light weapons. International peace and security will be strengthened when and if international law is strictly observed. We believe that international law should be strengthened as the core of security relations. In this connection, Mongolia welcomes the recent adoption by the Rome Conference of the Statute of the International Criminal Court. We are in favour of a truly independent court and look forward to its early establishment and coming into operation. This would constitute an important milestone in strengthening international law and justice. Mongolia condemns all acts of international terrorism. Therefore, it resolutely condemns the recent terrorist bombings in Kenya, Tanzania and Northern Ireland and believes that international terrorism should be fought by joint efforts and in full accordance with the norms and principles of international law. It believes that acts of terrorism should be condemned wherever, by whomever and against whomever they are carried out. The fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is an event of special significance. It is connected with the tremendous changes that have taken place over the last half-century in the concept of human rights and the practice of ensuring them. Thanks to the Declaration, unprecedented high standards have been set for protecting human dignity. Since the adoption of the Declaration in 1948, those standards have been strengthened and further developed by numerous international treaties and conventions and have become truly universal. The legal foundations reflecting the world standard of protection and promotion of human rights were laid down in Mongolia?s 1992 Constitution. Since then it has been further developed and concretized by relevant legislation and the establishment of the necessary administrative and legal machinery based on United Nations human rights treaties and conventions to which Mongolia has acceded. At present preparations are under way for the establishment of a national human rights commission. A draft law to that effect has been submitted to the Parliament for its consideration and adoption. As it confronts the many global problems before it and approaches the new millennium, the world community places great hopes in the activities of a strong and well-equipped United Nations. In that connection, Mongolia firmly supports the Secretary-General?s reform package. In implementation of decisions and recommendations of United Nations summit conferences on major global social and economic problems, and in support of the so- called silent revolution, my Government has adopted a national action programme for the twenty-first century and, in close partnership with bodies of the United Nations family and non-governmental organizations operating in Mongolia, is launching an ambitious project: the One-World Conference Series, which is aimed at ensuring an integrated follow-up to the world conferences and summits held in the early 1990s. Reform of the United Nations cannot be complete without the reform and expansion of the Security Council. In that connection, I would like to reiterate my Government?s conviction that the Council should reflect political realities, and, besides becoming more effective, its membership should be enlarged to reflect more equitable representation. It is our hope that the General Assembly debates on this important issue will soon result in concrete decisions. We believe that energetic efforts should be undertaken to make the Millennium Assembly an occasion for reforming and revitalizing the Security Council. On the proposal of Mongolia, the General Assembly is drafting a set of guiding principles for conducting international negotiations. We believe that the development and adoption of such a set of principles would contribute to enhancing the effectiveness of negotiations as the most universal instrument for international cooperation. 23 My Government continues to pursue its political and economic reforms. Mongolia?s commitment to the irrevocable realization of the principles of democracy, liberalism and market economy is irreversible, despite the great difficulties of the transition period. The future major policy priorities will continue to include, inter alia, strengthening of democratic institutions, enhancement of the basis of political stability, acceleration of privatization in the economic field, and social protection of the population, especially of its vulnerable groups. On behalf of the Mongolian people and its Government, I take this opportunity to express our deep gratitude to the international community, especially donor countries and international financial institutions, for their assistance to Mongolia since it joined the community of open societies and democratic nations. A century that has been full of dramatic and consequential events is drawing to a close. It has been a century of great social upheaval and experimentation as well as of unprecedented social progress and technological advances. We believe that a more promising millennium is in store for all humankind and that the world community will be able to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century. Mongolia stands poised at this historic juncture to make its contribution to the efforts of the United Nations to bring about a brighter and more secure future.   Let me first extend my sincere congratulations to the new President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session, His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay. I am confident that his diplomatic experience will play an important role in the work of the Assembly. At the same time, I would like to thank Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko of Ukraine for the skilful manner in which he presided over the work of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly. I welcome the opportunity to address the General Assembly on behalf of a nation that has emerged more vital than ever before from one of the worst regional crises since the Second World War. The free and sovereign Croatia of today harbours a vibrant market place of ideas, innovative economic and rich social and cultural practices. We are learning that democracy means the right to both rational and what at times might appear irrational choices. We are learning that the free-market economy is both a prospect for success and a risk of failure. Positive results are already visible. Croatia of today, although still burdened by the multiple tasks of transition, reconstruction, the return of refugees and displaced persons and reconciliation, stands firmly rooted in the maturing Central European polity and economy. Croatia looks with ambition and sharpened senses towards reclaiming its place in the old Europe and contributing to the new Europe and the global community. Since ancient times Croatia has been a European country. Integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions remains our strategic goal. Therefore, Croatia will continue to march towards it, being devoted to its high standards and committed to its principles. This year Croatia is presiding over the Central European initiative with a great sense of responsibility. Furthermore, Croatia hopes to join the World Trade Organization soon. As a Central European and Mediterranean country, Croatia will further endeavour to remain a key agent of stability and peace in this part of the world. Through its responsible policy towards the crisis which has marked the recent history of this part of Europe, Croatia has affirmed its indispensable role in the most important political developments in this region. Even though the war is behind us, Croatia is still grappling with the legacies of aggression, such as the problems of devastated economic infrastructure, missing persons, ongoing assistance to war victims and invalids and the return of displaced persons and refugees. This means that my country is undergoing a double transition at the same time. The transition from war to peace is equally complex and demanding. In June this year, the national Programme for the Return and Accommodation of Displaced Persons, Refugees and Exiled Persons was adopted, and, as everybody agrees, it is being successfully implemented. So far, more than 45,000 Croatian Serbs have returned. Croatian authorities are also taking numerous steps and measures to encourage the process of reconciliation. A successful donors’ conference on reconstruction, to be held later this fall, should further contribute to the ongoing process of return and normalization of daily life, especially in the war-affected areas. Croatia is increasingly focusing on post-war reconstruction, economic growth and development, as well as on the overall normalization of relations with its neighbours to the east and south. But it must be stressed that full normalization of relations with neighbouring 34 countries has always been a cornerstone of our policies from the very outset. Croatia was not only the first country to recognize Bosnia and Herzegovina as an independent and sovereign country, but it has also helped Bosnia and Herzegovina more than any other party in its struggle to survive within its internationally recognized borders. Hence, let me repeat that for the Republic of Croatia as a guarantor of the Dayton Peace Agreement, the following basic principles remain paramount: first, Bosnia and Herzegovina as a single, internationally recognized State; second, the decentralization of State apparatus; and third, full equality of the three constituent peoples. Croatia cannot support any solution for Bosnia and Herzegovina that does not fully incorporate these founding principles or that in any way amounts to a revision of the Dayton principles. Deviations from or tacit abrogation of these principles can be both damaging and destabilizing not only to Bosnia and Herzegovina itself, but also to the other countries in the region. Croatia firmly believes that the recent elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina will further contribute to lasting stability and security. The agreement on free transit through the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina at Neum and use of the Croatian port of Ploce, which will be formally signed shortly, is yet another example of good-neighbourly relations between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia has signed an agreement on the State to State Council on Cooperation with Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia supports the efforts by the Office of the High Representative, United Nations representatives and the peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina and shall spare no effort in doing what is in its power to help them fulfil their mandate. We have come a long way in our bilateral relations with our eastern neighbour, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Since the end of hostilities, 10 bilateral agreements have been signed. We hope that the last outstanding issue, concerning the security arrangement for the Prevlaka area, will be negotiated promptly. Negotiations formally began on 15 September 1998. Croatia stands ready not only to open the border crossings with the Republic of Montenegro, but also to continue with demilitarization on our side of the border and with the present security regime currently administered by United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP). Whether it is through successful bilateral negotiations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, through the Security Council or even through unilateral action consistent with the rights and duties of Croatia under international law, the UNMOP mandate should terminate by 15 January 1999, because in the present circumstances another prolongation of the mandate can be misused to stall negotiations indefinitely. The other United Nations mission in the Republic of Croatia, the United Nations Civilian Police (UNCIVPOL), with a mandate in the Croatian Danubian region, is approaching its final stage, after having successfully completed its task in that part of Croatia and, together with recently adopted measures by the Croatian Government, having helped create conditions for reconciliation and a comprehensive return process. Termination of both United Nations missions will be a new landmark in the life of our country and will confirm once again its sovereignty and integrity over its entire territory. While it has lent its full support and cooperation to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Croatia is not satisfied with its results thus far. Indictments issued so far do not adequately reflect the scope of war crimes committed by different sides in the conflict nor the level of involvement. The Republic of Croatia helped to persuade 11 Bosnian Croats to voluntarily surrender to The Hague Tribunal. Three of them have been acquitted while the rest have been awaiting trial for over 12 months, much longer than usual in any individual State. On top of that, not a single person — despite promises made as far back as the Dayton negotiations — has been charged for crimes committed against Bosnian Croats. Furthermore, only one Serb was brought to The Hague for crimes committed during the aggression against Croatia, but he died in prison and was never sentenced. The most notorious perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity — Karadzic, Mladic and Martic — still remain at large, and in many cases in full view of the international community. The Republic of Croatia shares the concern of the international community on the rapidly worsening situation in Kosovo and the impending threat to international peace and security. As a neighbouring country of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Croatia is vitally interested in a speedy resolution of the crisis. We join the international community in condemning violations of human rights in Kosovo, and we denounce all forms of terrorism, regardless of whether they are committed by a State, a group or an individual, bearing in mind that State 35 terrorism represents the most dangerous form of terrorism, due to the resources available to States. Croatia supports a peaceful and negotiated solution that would respect both the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the rights of Kosovo Albanians to autonomy. Croatia is alarmed at the imminent humanitarian catastrophe, which needs urgent and determined international action. The twentieth century can boast of tremendous achievements in various fields on the individual as well as the collective level, while awareness of global interdependence in every respect is growing. However, we must face the fact that we are also witnesses to the negative legacies of the twentieth century: the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; terrorism; narcotics production, trafficking and consumption; lagging development; disregard for the environment; the rise of transnational crime; and continued grave breaches of fundamental human rights and humanitarian law. On the fiftieth anniversary of United Nations peacekeeping and the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, let us ask ourselves: what is the United Nations, what does it really do? I agree with those who strongly believe that the United Nations is not only a global Organization in which Governments exchange views, muster support for their policies and views or trade in votes and influence. The United Nations is much more than an Organization; it is a living idea for a better world. Values do matter. Like all organizations, the United Nations has aged, and its structure and mechanisms have become anywhere from slightly to grossly obsolete. To meet the challenges and needs of the emerging global society at the turn of the century, the United Nations must evolve just as quickly or risk being overtaken by other institutions or initiatives that may or may not be universal in scope, and may or may not more faithfully reflect the credo of a better world for all of us. It is high time that we again acted as “We the peoples”. It is Croatia’s view that the reform of the United Nations should take many forms and focus not only on the needs of the Organization — that is, on the fulfilment of its legislative mandates — but also on increasing its effectiveness on the global stage. The Secretary-General has done his part, and it is now up to each and every one of us — as nations, as peoples, as individuals — to partake in reforming the United Nations for the next millennium. The reform of the Security Council remains imperative. While the founding principle of the sovereign equality of States must be strictly maintained, both the structure and operation of the Security Council must be harmonized with the new realities in international affairs. Interdependence, liberalization of polities and markets and the profoundly widened access to instantaneous communication all demand that the function and use of the veto power be readjusted, and that this pivotal world body operate in a more transparent, representative and otherwise democratic structure. Croatia thus supports the enlargement of the Security Council in both categories, permanent and non-permanent, fully in line with its repeatedly declared positions. Several important world conferences have been held under United Nations auspices in the past decade; the time has come to implement the findings and evaluate the results of those conferences. We firmly believe that the role of the Economic and Social Council remains important to the well-being of this Organization and its Members. Although Croatia has increased its presence in United Nations expert bodies, including two commissions of the Economic and Social Council, we can do and wish to do more. Hence, Croatia attaches paramount importance to its candidature for the Economic and Social Council for the years 2000-2002. The need for further improvement of international security structures and mechanisms deserves our special attention. If it has been identified with anything, the United Nations has been widely identified with its peacekeeping role. Nowadays, as we approach the end of the active and, by general estimation, highly successful United Nations peacekeeping presence in Croatia, the Croatian Government and people feel very strongly that the time has come for Croatia to pay back in kind some of the good deeds bestowed on us by the United Nations community. It was with a sense of pride and responsibility that I submitted a letter to the SecretaryGeneral earlier today, formally notifying him of Croatia’s readiness to join the ranks of peacekeeping contributor countries. Disarmament and international security issues are critically important in our efforts to preserve peace and enhance stability in the increasingly volatile world. Croatia is particularly concerned about the problem of landmines. We still suffer from the consequences of more than 2 million mines scattered all over our country during the imposed war. A lot of work has been done to 36 alleviate the problem, but many areas have not yet been cleared. This situation adversely affects the process of return of displaced people and refugees and slows down economic reconstruction and development. The sheer magnitude of this problem requires a more forceful and resourceful global response, be it financial or technical. Croatia ratified the Ottawa Convention in May 1998 and strongly supports the efforts in the Conference on Disarmament to start negotiations on a global ban by building on the achievements of the Ottawa process. The developments in disarmament, non-proliferation and international security since our last session can be a cause of great concern. International terrorism is another threat to security and peace in the world. Croatia joins others in unequivocally condemning all forms of terrorism, regardless of their motives or origin. Croatia also supports the strengthening of international cooperation in order to bring those responsible to justice and prevent further abhorrent acts of violence. My Government has ratified all major anti-terrorist treaties and actively participates in the current work on a nuclear terrorism convention. Croatia joins the rest of the world in commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In the past 50 years it has become obvious that we should all work hard to establish efficient mechanisms for the protection of human rights. More objective criteria must be developed for their evaluation in order to avoid politicization and establish a universal standard in human rights. In November 1997, Croatia ratified the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and accepted the competence of the European Court of Human Rights and the European Commission of Human Rights to deal with individual cases. Croatia has also ratified the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Croatia welcomes the results of the Rome Conference on the establishment of an International Criminal Court, and thanks the host country, Italy, for its generous hospitality. Although not all aspirations could be fully accommodated in Rome, the establishment of an efficient, permanent International Criminal Court will be a milestone in the march towards the universal protection of human rights and the rule of law. Croatia intends to sign and ratify the Statute of the court in the near future and calls on other States to do the same. The role of the United Nations remains of vital importance for the world today. Under its auspices, many praiseworthy achievements have been made in various fields. The United Nations has played an important role in Croatia, in time of war as well as now, when its two missions are about to complete their mandates. The United Nations presence in Croatia will continue at a level of partnership in addressing social and, especially, development questions. Only a strong and reformed Organization will be able to adequately meet the increasing and changing needs of its Member States. In conclusion, therefore,I would like to say again that values do matter. We the peoples are capable of truly reforming the United Nations. We both need and deserve a United Nations that is able and equipped to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.Permit me to offer, on behalf of President Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and the Government and the people of Sierra Leone, our warm felicitations to Mr. Didier Opertti on his unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session, and to express our delegation?s confidence that under his able guidance our session will be a successful one. We are in no doubt that his distinguished public record adequately equips him for the position he has been called upon to assume, and we have already seen evidence of this in the last two weeks. We must also express gratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Udovenko of Ukraine, for a job well done. Our gratitude also goes to Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary- General, and to the entire staff of the United Nations common system for their relentless efforts in helping the people of Sierra Leone in the mammoth task of reconstruction, rehabilitation and resettlement of hundreds of thousands of our compatriots who were the unfortunate victims of nine months of junta misrule. Mr. Annan has put the international ship of state on the right course, and my delegation wishes him continued success. This time last year, my President addressed the Assembly on the subject of the situation in Sierra Leone. I am sure most members will remember the picture he painted of the tragic events and the turmoil that followed when a democratically elected Government was overthrown by a bunch of military adventurists, aided and abetted by some civilian opportunists who became their active collaborators. Thanks to the resilience of the whole of civil society, encouraged and backed by the international community, I am here today representing the legitimate, reinstated Government of Sierra Leone. Against all odds, our people defied the violent and misguided gun-toting anarchists who appeared to have one objective, and one only: the total destruction of the civil society of Sierra Leone. Mercifully, that nightmare is now behind us. In February this year, the forces of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), under the then ECOWAS Chairman, the late General Sani Abacha of Nigeria, led by Nigeria and with the support of our Civil Defence Unit, removed the junta. This was preceded by several attempts to arrive at a negotiated settlement. The international community was to learn that the junta and their allies, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), always negotiated in bad faith and were not to be trusted. The atrocities committed by the junta during their nine-month reign, especially after they retreated to the eastern and northern parts of the country, had to be seen to be believed. Rape, murder, mutilation, vandalism and the burning down of whole villages were the order of the day. Unarmed civilians, particularly women and children, were their unfortunate victims. Because of the wanton destruction perpetrated by the junta and, much earlier, by the RUF, there is a great need to revamp the economy and for reconstruction. In a report to the General Assembly, the Secretary-General referred to the Special Conference on Sierra Leone, which he convened here at United Nations Headquarters on 30 July this year. The international community was invited to focus on the situation in Sierra Leone. 21 We were very much encouraged, not only by the deliberations and results of that conference, but also by the deliberations of the second ministerial-level Security Council meeting on Africa, held last week, in which Sierra Leone featured prominently. The humanitarian crisis is immense: there are many refugees and displaced persons. The disarmament and demobilization exercise and the resettlement, rehabilitation and reconstruction processes require many resources. Some of the pledges that were made are now being fulfilled, but much remains to be done. Allow me to echo the appeal of the Secretary-General to those who have yet to pledge, and to others who have yet to deliver, to do all they can to help us. In the meantime, I would like to express profound gratitude to all members, and especially to the members of the contact group to be coordinated by the United Kingdom, for what has been achieved so far. As soon as the legitimate Government was overthrown, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), at its meeting in Harare in June 1997, unanimously condemned the takeover and called on the junta to return power and constitutionality to the elected Government and to the country respectively. The prompt action of ECOWAS, the resultant peace in Liberia and now the return of democracy to Sierra Leone, clearly demonstrate what a regional organization can achieve if the determination and the leadership are there. ECOMOG has the capacity to deliver, but it needs the tools, which only the international community can provide. My country is fully aware that even though the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC)/RUF junta has been ousted, the peace and security that were achieved with enormous sacrifice by the people of Sierra Leone have yet to be consolidated. It is therefore in the interests of the people that the international community in general and the forces of the subregion in particular, maintain their presence in Sierra Leone until we can create a new national army. In this regard, the Federal Republic of Nigeria has agreed to the secondment of Brigadier-General Maxwell Khobe, Commander of the ECOMOG Force in Sierra Leone, as our Chief of Defence Staff. He is already working on the modalities for forming a well-trained and dedicated army which will be alive to its responsibility as defender of our Constitution. I have every reason to believe that that assignment will be carried out with the same professionalism that has been the hallmark of ECOMOG operations in both Liberia and Sierra Leone. At this juncture, I would like to state that the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone is committed to the demobilization, disarmament and integration of all ex-combatants, as provided for in both the Abidjan Peace Accord and the Conakry peace plan, despite the lack of good faith that has been demonstrated by both the RUF and the junta. This programme is at the top of our post- conflict agenda, and the Disarmament Committee itself is under the chairmanship of no less a person than our President. Because of its overwhelming desire to uphold the principles of democracy and good governance, the Government lays much emphasis on the rule of law, human rights and freedom of expression. There are over 48 newspaper publications in a country with 80 per cent illiteracy. Despite propaganda to the contrary, no journalists have been prosecuted, let alone convicted, for practising their profession — not even when the headlines of a few have sometimes bordered on libel. Of the 16 people recently convicted of treason, after a trial that was declared transparent and fair, five were journalists; but they were not charged for the practice of journalism. President Kabbah and the ECOMOG Force Commander informed the Special Conference on Sierra Leone that more than 90 per cent of the country was secure and safe. Remnants of the junta and the RUF are, however, perched in small areas in the east and north-east and operate only because they continue to have a safe haven in a neighbouring country, while one other country renders its support to them from outside Sierra Leone. That notwithstanding, every effort is now being made by both ECOMOG and the Civil Defence Unit to flush them out and to finally put this whole tragic affair behind us. The treason trials of both civilians and former junta members are still in progress, under laws which have been in existence since independence. Soon after sentence was passed on the first group, some misguided organizations began unfairly pressurizing the President to intervene; they even mounted a vicious propaganda campaign in the name of human rights. My country is governed by the rule of law. Under our constitution there is separation of powers between the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. While the due process of law is in progress, the President cannot and will not interfere with it. At the end of the exercise those who lose their final appeals to the Supreme Court can apply to the Prerogative of Mercy Committee. Then, and 22 only then, will the President step in, and he has already given that assurance. Our President has not only gone the extra mile, but is seen to be bending over backwards to bring together all the main political groups into the mainstream of the post- conflict nation-building exercise, so as to secure permanent peace and security. There have been no instances of human rights violations since President Kabbah assumed office. With regard to the armed rebellion in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the rebel wars in Angola, Sudan and elsewhere, we appeal to the parties in those conflicts to lay down their arms, to refrain from further provocative activities that ignite tempers and to give peace a chance. Our Government welcomes the successful outcome of the United Nations Diplomatic Conference on the establishment of the International Criminal Court, which took place in Rome, Italy, in June 1998. Sierra Leone is firmly committed to the early establishment of a permanent international court, and my Government has already signed the Statute of the International Criminal Court. We urge every nation to sign and ratify the Statute. It will be not only testimony to the common desire to overcome long neglected failures of national legal systems, but a unique chance to contribute to international stability deterrence and, hopefully, the prevention of atrocious crimes. Security Council reform is one of the most difficult issues which have to be tackled during this session. While progress has been made in some areas, and new ideas and proposals have emerged, the Working Group has not presented recommendations to the General Assembly. Sierra Leone agrees with the position of the Non-Aligned Movement on the curtailment, limitation and subsequent elimination of the veto. Sierra Leone fully endorses the decision of the Assembly of the Heads of State or Government of the Organization of African Unity for two permanent seats to be allocated to our continent. As for the expansion of the Security Council, Sierra Leone supports the position taken by the Non-Aligned Movement, that, in order to enhance its credibility, the new Council should reflect the universal character of the world and correct existing imbalances in its composition. My country cannot talk of conflicts and peace without referring to nuclear arms. When negotiations were being conducted in Geneva on a comprehensive test-ban treaty, a few years ago, the Republic of Sierra Leone was one of those countries which prayed silently for its success. We are relieved and thankful that the Treaty has been signed by a large number of countries. We continue to call on all nations to sign the test-ban treaty and refrain from further tests, with their attendant danger to the future of mankind. In the same way as we oppose all future nuclear tests, we must with all the emphasis at our disposal condemn all forms of terrorism, both domestic and international. We refer particularly to the recent bombings which claimed the lives of hundreds of innocent people, not to mention the loss of property worth millions of dollars in Nairobi, Dar-es-Salaam, Cape Town and Northern Ireland. We call on the international community to coordinate its efforts to fight this menace. Those who insist on using this method to achieve their aims should be tracked down and brought to justice. In this regard, my country wholeheartedly supports the signing and ratification of all the Conventions on terrorism and appeals to the entire international community to adhere to the Conventions in order to make the world a safer place for our children?s children. My Government noted with great delight the conference convened last year in South Africa to focus the world?s attention on the dangers posed to human life by landmines. We revive the memory of the late Princess Diana, who did so much to focus the attention of the international community on the horrors of landmines. In our own country, too, landmines were strewn around with carefree abandon by the AFRC/RUF junta, resulting in the maiming and death of innocent civilians, especially children. Many African and other third world countries, including my own, are today still grappling with severe economic problems. The effects of the debt burden, the unfavourable balances of trade and payment, and the unpredictability of the prices of their products on the world market have all contributed to the deteriorating economic conditions they are facing. In addition to these external factors, misguided policies and political instability caused by various kinds of civil strife have caused their economies to sink further. Globalization and trade liberalization have become inevitable phases in world trade. It has, however, become obvious that our countries have fared badly and will continue to be at a disadvantage unless there is a change of attitude and even procedure on the part of developed, industrialized countries. The resultant imbalances can be overcome if every effort is made to create a level playing field by removing the debt burden of our countries and opening up markets to African and third world products. Some 23 countries have already done so; we hope that others will follow soon. I have already mentioned the refugee situation in my own country. It is grim, and yet the situation is the same in other parts of the world, especially Africa, which has the largest refugee populations. This situation has continued to exert tremendous pressure on the already weak economies of the host countries, which are forced to spend part of their meagre resources on the welfare of refugees. Having gone through this experience both as recipient and exporter of refugees, we must commend the donor community and especially the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Much is being done for us, but even the Office acknowledges that the situation of our refugees in neighbouring countries is desperate. I would like to appeal to the donor community to shed its donor fatigue syndrome and continue to respond positively to the needs of a people who are the innocent victims of events not of their own making. A very urgent need now is for the repatriation of our people from neighbouring countries, where life in camps is now a nightmare. Sierra Leone is one of the countries in our subregion that still have the remnants of what were once the Upper Guinea rain forest, which stretches from Sierra Leone down to the Cameroons. The reserve supports the largest number of animal species in Sierra Leone: a total of 46 mammal species, including Western chimpanzees, red colobus monkeys, Diana monkeys, duickers, leopards and forest elephants. Two hundred and seventy four species of birds are to be found in the Gola rain forest. These include 10 globally threatened species — 8 restricted to the Upper Guinea forest block — and 169 forest-dependent species. There is a very rich diversity of interesting invertebrates, including two species of dragonfly, endemic only to parts of the Upper Guinea forest, as well as the rare African swallow-tailed butterfly, which has Sierra Leone as the westernmost limit of its range in Africa. Unfortunately, the Gola rain forest, like most other forest areas on the continent, is under considerable pressure. Much of the forest cover is lost annually from logging and from brush burning as well as shifting cultivation carried out by an ever-increasing population. Conservation of these forests in Sierra Leone, as in other parts of Africa, is linked with poverty. The Forestry Division of our Ministry of Agriculture and the Environment has a Gola Rain Forest Conservation Programme. The programme is being operated in collaboration with a local non-governmental organization, the Conservation Society of Sierra Leone, the Sierra Leone partner of Birdlife International, which sponsors the programme. Notwithstanding this valuable work, pressure on forests in the third world will not be reduced unless we enhance food production from the same piece of land year after year, as happens in the industrialized countries. This can only be achieved by a transfer of food production technology to our own countries. I have made frequent references to the role of the international community in the restoration of democracy to my country and to the reinstatement of President Kabbah. I have mentioned the United Nations, the OAU, ECOWAS and the Commonwealth. I would like to make special reference to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The restoration of constitutional order and the various efforts of the Government to effect durable peace and to rebuild the country provide us with an opportunity to regain donor confidence and ensure the completion of various initiatives and programmes interrupted by the events of the coup of 25 May 1997. As lead agency in the partnership between the Government and the donor community, the UNDP, prior to the coup, had spearheaded the following: preparation of a national poverty-eradication programme; facilitating the establishment of a coordination mechanism for relief assistance by the humanitarian community; and facilitating the peace process through the provision of diplomatic, logistic, technical and administrative support to the peace negotiations and the preparation of the demobilization programme. Since the return of the elected Government in March 1998, the UNDP has spent considerable amounts of money in the development of various other programmes as well. I urge the international community to continue its support for these programmes and to help us in our task of rehabilitation. Let me close by referring again to the report of the Secretary-General, whom I have already thanked. I shall refer once more to the special conference he convened, for which I thank the Secretary-General. May I first congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the fifty- third session of the General Assembly and wish him every success in this important position. I would also like to thank his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, and praise him for the tireless energy he devoted to pushing through reform steps in the Organization. The Assembly is meeting at a time when the world is troubled by many major problems. Let me mention seven which I regard as crucial. The collapse of stock markets around the world, triggered by the Asian and Russian crises, shows how vulnerable national economies are in our increasingly globalized economy. Recent nuclear tests conducted by States not parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) have jeopardized the progress made in arms control and non-proliferation since the end of the cold war, progress which is vital if global peace is to be achieved. We have not yet been able to end wars in sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the world — including Europe, and most notably in the former Yugoslavia, where the conflict in Kosovo remains unresolved. Terrorism continues to threaten individuals and Governments. The attacks in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam are recent examples of the death and destruction terrorists continue to inflict on innocent people. Fundamental human rights and freedoms are still being violated and the human dignity of individuals is still being humiliated in many countries on all continents. The environment continues to be devastated by many aspects of humankind?s activity, global warming being one of the particularly ominous effects. And the gap between the rich and the poor is still widening despite many efforts to challenge hunger and poverty in the developing world. To address and solve these and other problems, international cooperation is essential. The traditional platform, the United Nations, remains the most suitable for organizing the global efforts and resources needed for this task. These issues are a tremendous challenge to the United Nations, and so it is essential that the capabilities of the United Nations be fully exploited. The Organization must respond to them with flexibility. It must provide realistic plans and procedures for dealing with problems as they arise. And it must exploit the political will necessary to implement programmes once they are put in place. A country?s international reputation is largely dependent on its domestic health. In my country, this year?s parliamentary elections resulted in a change of Government. I wish to stress that the top foreign policy priorities of the Czech Republic — joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union — stem from our desire to actively contribute to the implementation of the vision of a united, democratic, peaceful, socially just and prosperous Europe; a Europe without tensions or conflicts; a Europe of free citizens and cooperating regions based on mutual solidarity, human rights and cooperative security. The Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary are expected to join the Alliance in 1999. The integration of these countries, we believe, will justify the enlargement of NATO and its contribution to European security. We are keenly aware of our shared responsibility in this matter. We expect NATO?s door to remain open for other countries to join when they are ready. The Alliance?s present role is not limited to safeguarding the vital interests of its members by means of collective defence. Over time it has made a contribution to global and pan- European security. We are sure that, in close collaboration with other European security institutions — such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Western European Union and the Council of Europe — NATO will be able to lay foundations for a future all-European security. Preparing for the next round of enlargement of the European Union, an integration which is unique in the world, is a task for all Europeans. By opening up membership to Central and East European countries last year in Luxembourg, the Union has finally overcome the heritage of a divided continent. We hope the enlargement process will maintain the present momentum and that it will not be hampered by criteria other than the readiness of each candidate country. 29 Europe has been a contributor to global security. However, it still has to put its own house in order. One of the most complicated European security problems is managing the consequences of the division of the former Yugoslavia and, in particular, the restoration of a self- sustained peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and a settlement of the situation in Kosovo in the former Republic of Yugoslavia. We fully endorse the implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement and believe no better solution is available. The military objectives of the Peace Agreement have practically been met — that is undeniably one of the great successes of the implementation of Dayton. Further progress on the civilian side, however, continues to depend on a substantial international presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has to be maintained until the desirable end-state is achieved. That is why the Czech Republic continues to participate in the international Stabilization Force (SFOR) spending national resources both on its military contingent in SFOR and on the reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The worsening humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo due to the ongoing conflict has to be addressed as a matter of urgency. Belgrade must be strongly reminded that it has crossed the limits of what is tolerable and legitimate. We welcome the adoption of Security Council resolution 1199 (1998), adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter just a few hours ago. In our view, this resolution usefully foreshadows the necessary steps for the international community. The Czech Republic has traditionally paid great attention to the Middle East peace process, and we are concerned to see that little progress has been made. In our view, a positive future for this region can only be secured by successfully completing the peace process, and we believe the process can soon be revitalized. The Czech Republic also supports the endeavour of the international community to solve the problem of Cyprus. The current status quo is unacceptable. We hope that Cyprus will be united as a federation in accordance with the appropriate United Nations resolutions. We are deeply concerned to see the deterioration of security and the humanitarian situation in a number of African countries, including in the region of the Great Lakes, in Sudan and elsewhere. We fully support the efforts of the United Nations and its work with the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to settle conflicts and stop the human suffering in Africa. Positive developments we can now observe include an improving situation in Sierra Leone, which is a source of our optimism on the issue of Africa. We are ready to assist the various processes at work in Africa, including the dispatching of observers to respective United Nations peacekeeping operations, and in the development of cooperation. Recent problems in Asia have already been mentioned. Here we are concerned not only with the continuing regional economic and financial crisis and the nuclear tests, but also with enormous natural disasters taking thousands of lives and causing enormous material and environmental damage. The scourge of international terrorism must be countered vigorously, and in cooperation among all of us, as President Clinton eloquently appealed for at this forum two days ago. This task is high on the agenda of many, and we believe the United Nations, as the global platform, should assert its responsibilities. We endorse all initiatives aimed at cutting terrorists off from any support and resources, isolating them and strictly punishing them. Being a small country, the Czech Republic is naturally interested in all international efforts aimed at prevention and resolution of armed conflicts. We support United Nations peacekeeping operations and all efforts to make them more effective. I would like to reiterate that my country is committed to contributing further to United Nations peacekeeping operations, refining its own forces to meet the new requirements. Let me point out the increasing number of attacks against the personnel participating in peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, and join the call for strict punishment of the perpetrators of these shameful acts. We support nuclear disarmament and we look forward to the complete elimination of nuclear arsenals. This is why we regard the nuclear tests carried out in May 1998 by countries considered non-nuclear-weapon States as clearly negative steps. Universal compliance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is a logical step on the way towards nuclear disarmament, as is speedy enactment of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). On the other hand, the progress made in the Geneva Conference on Disarmament towards a fissile material cut-off treaty is encouraging. The Czech Republic appreciates the work of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in the area of chemical disarmament. We are prepared to continue contributing to the work of the Organization and to strictly implement all its commitments arising out of 30 the respective Convention. At the same time, we support all efforts meant to speed up the negotiation of the verification protocol text, which is to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC); we regard the protocol as an important mechanism controlling implementation of the Convention. The signing of the Ottawa Convention on the complete ban on anti-personnel landmines by about 100 Member States, including the Czech Republic, has been a great success. Now early entry into force has been ensured. Implementation, however, will be an even bigger task for all. While preparing for the ratification of the Ottawa Convention, we have a clear view of its domestic implementation. It is the Security Council that continues to have the decisive word in questions of peace and security. The Czech Republic considers itself among the reform-minded countries, supporting the Council?s enlargement, in both categories of membership, which guarantees equitable geographic representation. To be more specific, we continue supporting the aspirations of the Federal Republic of Germany and Japan in this respect. It is rather disappointing that after five years of the Working Group?s dealing with this issue concrete results have not been achieved. On the contrary, it seems that Member States are even further apart on the issue. Unfortunately, the same applies to the question of improving and simplifying the methods of the Council?s work, on which consensus seemed to be near a year ago. It is our view that the Working Group should continue its work with the aim of achieving general agreement, to the extent possible, until the end of the millennium. We hope that talks will eventually produce concrete results that could be put on the agenda of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly within the Millennium Assembly concept. The new Government of the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the issue of human rights. This December we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a document substantially influencing the international community and international relations. The record of these 50 years is no doubt impressive, but there is still a long way to go to achieve the desired universal acceptance and indivisibility of human rights. This sad situation can be illustrated by the fact that there are still countries governed by totalitarian regimes where people are punished for such absurd “crimes” as distributing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or for refusing to explain where they obtained such a “subversive document”. However, it has to be admitted that economic sanctions or embargoes do not seem to be effective means of persuading a country to promote human rights. The successful conclusion of the Diplomatic Conference in Rome last July, which resulted in the shaping of the International Criminal Court, fills us with hope. The adoption of the Court?s Statute is a clear breakthrough in the area of humanitarian law and human rights protection. We are aware that this is only an initial stage of the long process leading to a functioning Court, but the step taken in Rome was crucial. I would like to express our gratitude to the Government of Italy for its substantial contribution to the success of the Conference. Cooperation in the social, economic and humanitarian areas should undoubtedly be, in addition to building peace and security, major preoccupations of the United Nations. Over the last few years there have been strong discussions on the Economic and Social Council and its function. The Czech Republic was actively involved during its Council presidency in 1997. The challenge for the Council, stemming from globalization of economic and other links, was enormous. On the other hand, the actual possibilities of this body to tackle substantial issues were rather limited. But now we are pleased to see it undergoing some promising changes. The Czech Republic appreciates the attention paid by the United Nations to the critical issue of globalization and its impact on economic and social development in the different countries of the world. For many, like my country, whose economies are undergoing a fundamental transformation, the consequences of globalization are doubly difficult to handle. That is why we would like the United Nations to have a clear agenda on globalization, and we are encouraged by the lead provided by the Secretary-General. The new Government of the Czech Republic has promised in its Programme Statement wide support for the strengthening of United Nations authority. We have welcomed the results so far achieved in implementing the Secretary-General?s plan for United Nations reform. Much of the reform package, however, remains unresolved, and a number of proposals have not left the negotiating table. The Czech Republic supports speedy approval and implementation of the remaining reform proposals. 31 However, even the best blueprints do not count for much without money to implement them. Like others, I want to stress that the financial situation of the Organization is alarming, and I would like to underline that discipline with regard to contributing is a must for all. We look with expectations to the proposed Millennium Assembly to be held in the year 2000, inspired, among others, by Czech President Václav Havel. The Millennium Summit held within its framework could then focus on the challenges the United Nations will be facing in the next millennium and identify major trends and objectives of future United Nations activities. In addition, an important role could be played by a related non-governmental “Millennium Forum”. The Czech Republic?s special contribution to such a debate can be “FORUM 2000”, a conference taking place in Prague next month aimed at highlighting global problems that humankind faces at the threshold of the twenty-first century. In conclusion, allow me to express my sincere belief in the eventual success of the United Nations reform process. I think we can all agree that from this process the United Nations, a truly remarkable Organization, will emerge consolidated, strengthened and more capable than ever of solving the problems of the contemporary world — an Organization open to all who are willing to contribute to the fulfilment of this important task.  His illustrious election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session gives me the pleasant opportunity to express to Mr. Opertti, on behalf of the people and Government of the Niger, our warmest congratulations. His unanimous election is assuredly a legitimate confirmation both of his personal merits and of the firm commitment of his country, Uruguay, to the triumph of our Organization?s noble ideals. These congratulations I extend to the other members of the Bureau who help the President in his task, in the achievement of whose success I can guarantee the full cooperation of the delegation of Niger. I would also like to express my sincere compliments to the President?s predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his invaluable work as President. To Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of our Organization, I am happy to repeat here the full support of the Government of Niger for his remarkable activities in the service of world peace and the courageous reform work he is doing in order to allow the United Nations to better respond to the challenges of the coming new millennium. I cannot fail to pay tribute to his outstanding success in finding, through determination and courage, a diplomatic way out of the Iraq crisis at the beginning of this year, thus greatly contributing to the safeguarding of peace and security in the region and thus to enhancing the credibility and the prestige of our Organization, as well as to the strengthening of his personal commitment and his authority. For more than a half century the United Nations has carried out one of its main missions by saving us from a third world conflict, which certainly would have been fatal to humankind. The end of the cold war brought hope of the emergence of a new international order based on total respect for the principles laid down in the United Nations Charter and international law, even if that hope needs further strengthening, in particular because of the persistence of violent and murderous conflicts, the increase of tensions of all kinds and the accumulation of increasingly destructive weapons by a growing number of nations. Africa remains the region of the globe most affected by conflicts — repeated, disturbing conflicts, genuine sources of instability, of intolerable suffering and of apocalyptic movements of populations and impoverishment. That is why the Government of Niger welcomed the Security Council initiative to invite the Secretary-General to submit a report to it on the causes of conflict in Africa and their possible remedies. I would like once again to congratulate the Secretary-General on the important report (S/1998/318) he submitted, a report remarkable for its frankness and its realistic recommendations for assuring durable peace and sustainable development in Africa. It is our earnest hope that this report will contribute to awakening the human conscience and bringing the international community to a point where it will further help the efforts of the African countries in their unremitting search for peace and prosperity. 6 Within the framework of the efforts made in Africa to redress the situation, the people and Government of Niger welcome the success this year in defusing numerous conflicts, particularly those in the Central African Republic and Sierra Leone. By personally participating in the festivities which marked the return to power of Mr. Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, the democratically elected President of Sierra Leone, I was able to show my Government and people?s deep commitment to democratic processes and the establishment of the rule of law in Africa. This is a good opportunity to pay tribute to the decisive, beneficial role played by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) in the restoration of constitutional legality and the return of calm to Sierra Leone, thereby implementing the political will and determination of the ECOWAS heads of State. The exemplary intervention of ECOWAS to resolve conflicts in the West Africa subregion testifies to the opportuneness of giving more responsibility to subregional and regional organizations in the prevention and management of conflicts. Their unparalleled local knowledge could, when necessary, be given the logistic support and expertise of the United Nations to deal with local conflicts, in keeping with the prescriptions of the Agenda for Peace of the Secretary-General and with the provisions of the Charter. Despite major progress achieved in this respect, the hostilities which are troubling several subregions show that the goal of peace is far from being achieved on the continent. Somalia remains deep in torment, despite laudable efforts by neighbouring countries and the international community to promote national reconciliation and the restoration of a normal political and social life. Confrontations and strife are continuing in the Great Lakes region, where instability and insecurity, as well as the poverty which accompanies massive movements of populations, daily trouble our consciences. Faced with the unremitting recurrence of differences and disputes which degenerate here and there into armed conflicts, we urge the countries concerned to show restraint and to accede, with the help of the international community, to offers of mediation to resolve their differences, in keeping with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU), to which they have freely subscribed. Certain claims relating to identity, as well as the exacerbation of social, cultural or political characteristics, often generate violent upheavals, which may rapidly take the form of terrorism, at times blind and bloody. Faced with these phenomena, the international community must unite in efforts to pursue and deepen its thinking and the collective action initiated a few years ago at the Sharm el- Sheikh summit in Egypt, in order to deal appropriately with these problems. In this regard, Niger would like, through me, from this lofty rostrum, to reaffirm once again its firm condemnation of terrorism and any use of violence in relations between nations, peoples and States. Just as we explicitly and firmly condemned the cowardly attacks carried out last August against American diplomatic representatives in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, and in Nairobi, Kenya, so do we disapprove of the unilateral resort to military force against sovereign States. In this regard, the Government of Niger deplores the attack against the Al Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum, an attack which took the lives of many innocent people and undermined the provision of pharmaceutical products in several countries of the region. Therefore, it seems necessary to us to consider quickly sending to Khartoum an international mission of inquiry, as requested by the Sudanese authorities. We in Niger believe the request to be sincere, having had the privilege of visiting on 6 May the sites and the pharmaceutical factory in question. The Middle East peace process has been at a stalemate for more than a year now despite the invaluable efforts of its sponsors to revive it. Therefore it is necessary to deploy every effort to bring the Government of Prime Minister Netanyahu to a point where it will respect the commitments Israel has solemnly made. The Government and people of Niger would like to reiterate their unswerving support for the cause of the Palestinian people and to reaffirm once again their conviction that no peace in the Middle East can be just and lasting until the Palestinian people regain their inalienable rights, including their right to establish an independent state on their national territory. Of course, peace in the region also means the withdrawal by Israel from the Syrian Golan and from southern Lebanon. That is why my Government welcomes the recent General Assembly resolution giving more prerogatives to the Palestinian representation within the 7 Assembly. It is our wish that this significant progress lead to the recognition of Palestine as a fully fledged member of the community of States. Turning to the question of Jammu and Kashmir, Niger, which supports the just struggle of the people of Kashmir to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination, deeply wishes that the international community continue to give full attention to this issue. The arms race and the escalation that we have seen in that area recently strengthens our conviction that we should urgently convene a new and fourth special session of the General Assembly on disarmament. Additional progress appears indispensable in the area of the control of weapons of mass destruction and the establishment of more effective standards concerning conventional weapons. The success achieved in banning anti-personnel mines should encourage us to go farther in order to bring about a better regulation of small arms and small-calibre weapons. In this case my country welcomes the measures taken to strengthen the Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Lomé. For several decades our Organization has been seeking to adopt a coherent approach to effectively meet the major challenges of poverty and development, in particular by working to establish a strengthened world partnership to finance development. It is time, therefore, to reverse the trend of reduced official development assistance and to join our efforts together to increase the scope of that assistance by revising its modalities. In this respect my country expects a great deal from the second Tokyo International Conference on African Development, set for October 1998. We expect that Conference to explore new strategies for mobilizing official development assistance and to reaffirm the international community?s commitment to make the development of Africa one of its priorities. It is indispensable, moreover, resolutely to implement bold policies to relieve and even to forgive the external debt of the poorer countries as part of a general agreement to resolve this problem, whose solution is overdue. That external debt represents an insuperable hindrance to any effort to bring about economic growth and human development in a large number of developing countries, and in particular in the most deprived among them. The marginalization of the African continent is continuing, which, in this era of globalization, calls for the establishment of an international mechanism that is capable of ensuring a more extensive integration of the developing countries into the world economy. As is well known, my country, Niger, is facing various factors that limit its efforts at development: increasingly harsh climatic conditions; food shortages; strong demographic pressure; being landlocked; a drop in the price of its main export product, uranium; too heavy an external debt; and low investment. All of these things have contributed to making us for some time now a country at the bottom of the ladder in terms of the human development index. But we have never given up, and my Government has drafted a national programme framework to combat poverty, proposing as a participatory measure a package of strategies in the medium term intended to control this scourge and to stimulate economic growth. This programme, moreover, is an essential component of our Economic Recovery Programme, which was adopted by our National Assembly in July 1997 and which last March in Geneva was the subject of a particularly successful round table. I take this opportunity, since these organizations are part of the United Nations system, to say here how deeply we thank not only the Bretton Woods institutions — the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund — but also the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Children?s Fund and the United Nations Population Fund. These agencies, which often have been among the first to perceive the key role that the right political and social environment plays in creative reform at the national level, have given us the benefit of their expertise and their advice and thus contributed to the success of that round table. We are certain that the promises of contributions they made at that meeting will very rapidly materialize. At this stage I wish to reaffirm solemnly here in the Assembly and before the entire international community that the democratic process is making headway in Niger and will remain irreversible under my guidance. The vitality of our democracy is reflected in, inter alia, a multi-party system, with an unhindered opposition, that is tirelessly attempting to establish a culture of dialogue and peace on a permanent basis. But our democracy is also reflected in the existence of a totally free private press, a civil society that plays a front-ranking role and an independent judicial system that is determined to protect the rights and freedoms that the Constitution guarantees to citizens. 8 As part of strengthening the democratic process and consolidating peace, particular attention is being given to strengthen intermediate bodies, which are important partners of civil society — the non-governmental organizations, associations and labour unions — so as to allow them effectively to contribute to the process of creating a more dynamic and conscious political life. My Government is resolutely committed to consolidating these democratic achievements, as evidenced by the holding on 22 November of this year of local elections that will establish a policy of decentralization which we have chosen to promote the participation of the people in development and also to bring about good governance in Niger. Similarly, on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, I wish to reaffirm solemnly that my Government will work tirelessly to do everything in its power to bring about respect for, and to respect, human rights, based on its conviction that this respect is a precondition for the progress of human society. In conclusion, I should like to express the full confidence that we have in the United Nations. In our view, this irreplaceable institution remains the only forum that can ensure the advent of a new world order based on justice, fairness, liberty and peace.  It is with great pleasure that I speak today, before this esteemed forum for international dialogue, on behalf of my country, the Republic of Paraguay. First of all, I would like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly and to extend to him my best wishes for success in the important task of guiding the work of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly of this Organization. I also have the pleasure to greet the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and to extend to him, on behalf of the people of Paraguay, our congratulations on his excellent fulfilment of his important mission. As the century comes to an end, so does a decade that has been for the world, and particularly for nations such as mine, a period of far-reaching and vertiginous transformation. In 1989, after almost four decades of authoritarian rule, Paraguay regained its democracy. Since that time, a great number of profound and dramatic changes have taken place in the process of reaffirming our democracy, a process that today, I am pleased to announce, may now be considered definitively consolidated, since for the first time in 50 years a civilian President has transferred the presidency of the Republic to another democratically elected civilian. This is an essential milestone in the recent history of our freedom and a striking testimony to the Paraguayan peopleâs firm and irreversible commitment to this system of government. We took over the administration of a country with major economic, social and moral problems, but, faithful to the peopleâs mandate, we will make the decisions that we deem appropriate and fitting to reactivate our economy, restore international confidence in Paraguay and, finally, ensure the sustainable and equitable development of its people. This, today, is my commitment, and I will dedicate all my devotion and labour to it, though I am aware that this effort would be in vain without the understanding, solidarity and support of my people, as well as the involvement and cooperation of friendly countries. In this regard, my Government has pledged to carry out a State agenda that is pragmatic and realistic. Its priorities will include restoration of the peopleâs faith in their leaders through transparent, coordinated actions whose immediate effects will, in the short term, result in greater well-being for the population. We will also carry out an all-out war against poverty by doing away with the privileges that engender injustices and intolerable inequalities. Another priority will be a rapid economic recovery through the implementation of social programmes and the construction of an infrastructure of all-weather roads, which will expedite and reduce the cost of the rapid transport of goods produced in rural areas to trade centres. We will also initiate programmes to provide inexpensive housing for a large sector of the population. We will give priority to the fight against crime in all its forms, focusing on the elimination of the scourges of drug-trafficking and the piracy and illegal appropriation of intellectual property. The concrete actions we have taken during our first month in office have clearly shown our firmness, determination and commitment in this regard. Another priority will be combating impunity, one of the ills that eats away at our society. We will be assiduous in the rigorous application of the law, which is the inevitable framework for ensuring confidence and development, particularly against those who profit from State resources, depriving the rest of the community of their legitimate chance to aspire to a better standard of 7 living. Exemplary measures will be adopted to address premeditated crimes in the economic and financial sphere. We trust that these measures, along with those for the protection of private property and an adequate framework of incentives and security for foreign investment, will assist us in recovering Paraguayâs international credibility and will bring in the flow of cooperation and investment necessary for our desired development. The reform of the principal organs of the United Nations â€” the General Assembly and the Security Council â€” is of the greatest importance to us. We have participated in the work of the Working Group on Security Council reform, and once again I wish to emphasize the importance we attach to the expansion of the Council in both of its categories; if the number of permanent members is increased, the number of non- permanent members must be increased as well. This increase must include Latin America and the Caribbean and the other regional groups, without any discrimination. We believe that the effort undertaken by the United Nations with regard to item 155 on the Assemblyâs agenda â€” â€œMeasures to eliminate international terrorismâ€ â€” is of the greatest relevance. Paraguay vehemently condemns and rejects such acts of international terrorism as the attacks on the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. In this respect, we wish to express our conviction that any international action to prevent and subdue terrorism must be carried out in full and complete compliance with international law. Another scourge, generally related to terrorism, is that of drug-trafficking, to which I have already referred. In this context, I must add that we are convinced that this is a problem of shared responsibilities among all countries involved, producing, transit and consuming countries. Our position on this point was clearly stated in the Declaration of the Twelfth Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Rio Group, held in Panama City. We welcome initiatives such as resolution 49/96, on horizontal economic cooperation and other modalities for cooperation among developing countries. We must also mention last yearâs Declaration and Plan of Action of San JosÃ©, Costa Rica, which defines specific modalities for dealing with sectoral problems relating to cooperation in the spheres of trade, investment, finance and business. However, we feel that the United Nations system should identify mechanisms, such as economic and technical cooperation, that will enable it to strengthen integration more effectively, and adopt decisions aimed at providing increased assistance. In this regard, my country will support such measures as will, in a more effective and coordinated manner, interest all participants â€” particularly private-sector participants â€” in the development process. We also endorse strengthening the United Nations to increase efficiency within the institutions of the Organization. If our Government programmes focus on supporting development with social justice we can give our peoples democracy, freedom and respect for human rights. However, we cannot ask our peoples to fight for development, to make greater sacrifices, if they do not see similar trends towards change and a unified commitment on the part of the international community. Complying with our commitments made at the Summit for Social Development, Paraguay intends to achieve the goals set there. In this regard, I am pleased to state that the priorities of our Administration include the social development of the country; reduction of the unemployment rate; the eradication of poverty; preservation of the environment â€” a commitment to our future generations; heeding the demands of our youth; and supporting the advancement of women and of integrated societies. Based on the fundamental principle of universality, the Republic of Paraguay feels that the United Nations system must welcome, without exception, all States that meet the requirements of the San Francisco Charter. Given this, and bearing in mind the elements that make up a State as well as other essential considerations, Paraguay feels that the proposed participation of the Republic of China in the United Nations and all its related bodies must be considered. This is what we would do with any other State that met the requirements of the Charter. I would now like to refer to one of the most important strategies for the socio-economic development of my country: its participation in the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), which is a fundamental objective of our foreign policy. The achievements of MERCOSUR, which was created in 1991 through the Treaty of AsunciÃ³n, as part of the process of integration, are a matter of pride for our four countries â€” Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay â€” as well as for Bolivia and Chile. These achievements have encouraged us to renew our efforts, certain that the political will that has guided us so far will lead us to achieve the goals that we have set for ourselves: to strengthen and consolidate the Customs Union and to move towards a greater level of integration. Moreover, it is encouraging to note that the path we chose in 1991 has attracted more and more interest from an increasingly globalized world. In this regard, MERCOSUR has shown its openness to dialogue, in particular with the sister countries of Latin America. We are not a closed community, but, rather, are open to initiatives that will promote economic, political and social cooperation. In this spirit, we are giving particular attention to the negotiations initiated to establish a free-trade zone for the hemisphere and to the negotiations we intend to hold in the near future with the European Union. The recent crisis in financial markets in South-East Asia and Eastern Europe, which have in turn threatened the stability of the financial markets of emerging economies, are a disturbing feature of todayâs international scene. It was mentioned in the Declaration of the Twelfth Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Rio Group, held in Panama City, in which the position of the signatory countries is clearly expressed. A great deal of hope has been placed in the work carried out by this Organization. We are on the threshold of a new millennium; the twenty-first century looms on the horizon, rich with opportunities and challenges. Our societies are suffering from the crisis of the birth of a new era, a new order, because we are not all yet adequately prepared to confront it. Therefore, our societies demand leadership from the United Nations. The conclusions, recommendations and actions that may come from this Assembly could be of fundamental importance for our immediate future. The problems emerging from the increase in globalization and interdependence, as well as the dizzying speed with which changes are taking place in the world, affecting all aspects of the human condition, force us inexorably to confront the challenge of finding the most ideal mechanisms for dialogue, understanding and effective and united international cooperation. We trust that the United Nations will be capable of meeting this challenge.  Allow me, first of all, to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. Secondly, allow me to express the profound regard and warm ties that unite Argentina and Uruguay, an ongoing relationship that was already under way at the beginning of the nineteenth century. We also extend our appreciation to Ambassador Udovenko for the courage, balance and impartiality he exhibited during the course of his mandate. In a globalized world, peace and security, economic stability and growth are more than ever indissolubly linked. The economic and financial crisis that concerns us today should boost our commitment to the economic reform process which we are carrying out in our region. Trade and foreign investment are clearly sources of opportunity and incentives to growth and competitiveness. But it is also clear that in recent decades the free movement of capital flows has been one of the main engines of economic development for many countries. 19 In order to dispel its negative effects, globalization requires educational, social and environmental policies that benefit all of society in a balanced and equitable manner. We feel it is damaging to succumb to the temptation of imposing restrictions on international trade in order to thwart the spread of economic crisis, or to resort to hampering or placing conditions on the flow of financial resources in order to moderate their volatility. In Latin America, countries such as Argentina have made sustained and coherent efforts to consolidate their financial situation, contain the budget deficit and provide assurances to foreign investment by helping to create a solid economic environment for the region, which is increasingly being seen with new eyes. A few days ago, the Presidents of the Rio Group, meeting in Panama, expressed their resolve to continue managing economic policy mechanisms in a responsible manner that guarantees stability and growth. Accordingly, financial institutions and those countries with the capacity to provide assistance should understand the problems that this critical economic situation presents to countries that find themselves in the eye of the storm and act accordingly. The Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) is today a model of economic foundations based on freedom and democracy in which cooperation is the very essence of the system. As an illustration of the excellent relations in the area of security and defense, Argentina pressed for the adoption of the Political Declaration of MERCOSUR, Bolivia and Chile as a Zone of Peace, which was signed at the MERCOSUR summit held in Argentina on 24 July 1998. The recent nuclear tests in South Asia constituted a step backwards with regard to regional and global security. These tests delay the economic development and well-being of the population. Argentina, together with countries that have renounced the military use of nuclear technology, has urged the States of that region to stop conducting tests and to adhere to the international instruments in force. Argentina, for its part, has offered to share fully its experience in peaceful nuclear cooperation. Allow me to recall that Argentina was the first country that, having mastered the nuclear fuel cycle, chose to limit its own use of this technology. We feel proud of the steps our country has taken in the last decade related to non-proliferation issues. In the nuclear field, we ratified the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco) in 1994 and the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1995, and have become a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. In the chemical and bacteriological field, we have promoted the Joint Declaration on the Complete Prohibition of Chemical and Biological Weapons â€” the Mendoza Agreement â€” of 1991, a commitment originally limited to Argentina, Brazil and Chile, which was later extended to most Latin American countries. We have also adjusted our domestic legislation strictly to control exports related to dual-use chemical, bacteriological and missile-related substances and technologies, in accordance with existing international instruments. Last July, as a follow-up to the Mendoza Agreement, we adopted the Ushuaia Declaration, which established the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) as an area free of weapons of mass destruction. Hence, Argentina has taken the decision to assume greater responsibility in this field. In turn, this decision has allowed us to continue exchanges of advanced technology. In relation to conventional weapons, we strongly support the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms, to which we regularly provide information. We also support other important initiatives recently adopted within the framework of the Organization of American States (OAS), such as the Inter-American Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives, and Other Related Materials and Other Appropriate Actions. Small arms constitute another source of international concern. It is worth mentioning that regional and international seminars have recently been held in Buenos Aires on this topic. We are not indifferent to the grave scourge of antipersonnel mines. In 1995, Argentina established a moratorium on the export of mines and more recently, in December 1997 at Ottawa, I had the honour to sign, on my countryâs behalf, the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti- Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. In our hemisphere we work earnestly and in a spirit of compromise to overcome all differences by means of negotiation. As we gradually resolve the few pending bilateral disputes, we will definitively consolidate our region as a zone of peace. We trust that in coming months we shall see important developments in that regard. Friendship among peoples is the best guarantee against conflict. 20 We are convinced that the United Nations presence in Haiti, in keeping with the desire of the Government of that country, will help to consolidate democracy and contribute to the prosperity of the Haitian people. The resurgence of terrorist attacks comes as a harsh reminder that no State is immune to terrorism. My country firmly supports the initiatives under way to supplement with new conventions the network of anti-terrorism norms now in force, leading to enhanced international cooperation and to establishing the obligation of all States to bring to justice and punish those responsible for these acts. The Argentine Government continues to make every effort to clarify the acts of terrorism committed against the Israeli embassy and the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association in Buenos Aires. Let me highlight the fact that on 2 September 1998 the Argentine Republic signed the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. Likewise, next November Argentina will host the second specialized inter- American conference on terrorism. Severe global humanitarian crises, usually accompanied by forced displacement of populations, constitute another issue that affects international peace and security. Argentina has joined in the international communityâs efforts, with bilateral assistance programmes and with such initiatives as the â€œWhite Helmetsâ€ initiative. In that context, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations devoting their energies to the solution of this type of crisis deserve our recognition. To grow and develop, peoples need to live in peace. We are dismayed to see that conflicts which could be overcome, such as those in Cyprus, the Middle East, the Great Lakes region of Africa, Angola and the Balkans, particularly Kosovo, persist in spite of the international communityâs efforts to resolve them. The situation of refugees, especially children, who are victims of these conflicts is a source of particular concern. In 1998 Argentina will mark the fortieth anniversary of its participation in peacekeeping operations. Our contribution has cost the lives of Argentine citizens who helped to make this a more secure and stable world. The vast experience acquired over these 40 years has been embodied in the Argentine joint training centre for peacekeeping operations, and in the Argentine gendarmerie training centre that specializes in civilian police operations abroad. Argentinaâs natural interest in the South Atlantic is reflected in our participation in the Zone of Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic, which brings together 24 African and Latin American countries from both shores of the Atlantic. I am particularly proud to announce that, on 21 and 22 October, Argentina will be the site of the fifth Ministerial Meeting of the countries members of the Zone. Unfortunately, there remains an important unresolved issue in the South Atlantic: the sovereignty dispute between the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland over the Malvinas Islands, a dispute whose existence has been unequivocally recognized in many resolutions of the General Assembly and of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, as well as in various other international forums. I reiterate, with the same conviction as always, the legitimate and well-founded rights of Argentina in that long-standing dispute. And, with the same conviction as always, I urge the United Kingdom to heed the call of the international community and observe United Nations resolutions calling upon both Governments to resume negotiations on all aspects of this question. The end of the cold war showed us that far more complicated problems have been resolved through frank, open dialogue and with a determination to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. I see no reason why the question of the Malvinas Islands should be an exception. Proceeding on firm footing, we have rebuilt our bilateral relationship and, for the benefit of the Argentine and British peoples, have strengthened political, trade and cultural ties. Evidence of this is the visit which President Carlos Menem is to make to the United Kingdom in the near future, for which both parties are engaged in enthusiastic preparations and which has generated high expectations at all levels. Similarly, we have left behind the misgivings and resentments of the past, learning from our mistakes and creating a climate of mutual trust in the South-West Atlantic, which is today enabling us to cooperate in the conservation of fishery resources and in exploration for hydrocarbons. That cooperation renders still more incomprehensible todayâs lack of communication between the islands and the mainland. There are few places in the world with such an unnatural situation. It is beyond doubt that restoring direct ties between the mainland and the 21 islands would contribute to resolving the problem. We have no doubt about this. Once again, I expressly reiterate Argentinaâs sincere desire to pursue a frank dialogue without preconditions. We hope that the British Government understands the full meaning of our offer and that it will respond accordingly. To the islanders I reiterate our unwavering commitment to full and unconditional respect for their way of life, their culture and their institutions. Our national constitution so provides, and that is the desire of the Argentine people. There have been concrete advances on vital questions. The creation of a permanent international criminal court is one such example. Similarly, the recent special session of the General Assembly devoted to the world problem of drugs adopted innovative documents of great importance. This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of the adoption of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. In these 50 years, the international community has become aware of the vital importance of human rights: today it no longer accepts what was once tolerated. The deterioration of the environment, in its various forms, is one of the problems urgently requiring concrete answers and effective commitment by governments and civil society. Argentina will have the honour of hosting the fourth Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, from 2 to 13 November of this year. We are convinced that a substantial part of our efforts to reform the Organization should be geared to designing a mechanism of closer and more effective cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions. With regard to reform of the Security Council, we believe that situations born out of the Second World War cannot prevail indefinitely. It is necessary to find democratic solutions that will allow for periodic renewal within the modalities preferred by each region. The viability of this reform will necessarily depend on the degree of consensus reached. There are several aspects to be borne in mind. The first is that the reform must be legally valid, which means not forcing interpretations of the Charter with regard to the majorities required by Article 108. Further, the reform must be founded on political legitimacy. Any increase in the number of permanent members should allow for a rotation open to all States of the respective regions. The crisis of our Organization is fundamentally one of participation. Many small and medium-sized countries feel excluded. Only by allowing greater participation in the Security Council will we be living up to the democratic ideals of the end of this century. The vitality of democratic ideals in the region was confirmed with the signing on 24 July of the Ushuaia protocol, which reaffirms the democratic clause in the countries of the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), Bolivia and Chile. The visit by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to the countries of our region last July was a very significant event. Argentina had the opportunity to demonstrate its clear commitment to assuming its global responsibilities. The Secretary-General recognized this, especially as regards peacekeeping.  Allow me at the outset to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay, Mr. Didier Opertti, on his election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. This decision, to which Georgia acceded with pleasure, is a fitting recognition of Uruguay’s high international authority and a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Opertti’s personal qualities and profound experience. At the same time, I am honoured to have the opportunity to express my gratitude to the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for his significant contributions to the successful outcome of the previous session. Today, as the second millennium is coming to a close, an inevitable question pops up: What will the next, the third, millennium be like? Indeed, for the first time since the end of the global stand-off, the opportunity has emerged to create a qualitatively new world order based 14 upon the comprehensive development of free and independent States. Allow me to share our observations on some of the important issues that we face. We have repeatedly underscored the threat to global stability posed by the spread of the disease of aggressive separatism and the ineffectiveness of our joint efforts to cope with it. For five years now, the conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia, has been on the agendas of a number of international forums. The need to resolve this conflict within the framework of the territorial integrity of Georgia and to ensure the speedy return of hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons has been reiterated more than once. However, we have to admit that real progress towards the settlement of this conflict has not been accomplished. Moreover, in May 1998, as a result of the punitive operation carried out by the Abkhaz side in the Gali region of Abkhazia, Georgia, more than 60 civilians were killed, about 1,400 houses burned and over 40,000 peaceful civilians expelled once again from their land. The vigorous efforts of the Georgian Government at that point averted full-scale confrontation and bloodshed. The tragedy in the Gali region was preceded by the unfulfilled resolutions of the Security Council and by decisions on the “ethnic cleansing” of the Georgian population in Abkhazia, Georgia, adopted at the Budapest and Lisbon summits of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Thus, we are once again confronted by the acute problem of the implementation of decisions taken by the international community. The Government of Georgia remains committed to a peaceful solution of the conflict and applies only political means, to which there is no reasonable alternative. In order to add new impetus to the peace process, we have welcomed the creation and development of the Geneva process, under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of the Russian Federation as facilitator, the Friends of the Secretary-General and the OSCE. More active work should be conducted in the framework of the Geneva process on the question of the political status of Abkhazia within the Georgian State. In our view, it is urgent to fully resume the functioning of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia and, in accordance with its mandate, to ensure the freedom of its activities. The matter of utmost importance is the safety of UNOMIG personnel in the conflict zone. Their vulnerability was again proved by the recent armed attack against four members of UNOMIG in Sukhumi. In this regard, we wish to emphasize the importance of the proposal of the Secretary-General concerning the deployment of self-protection units. Unfortunately, this question has turned into a subject of endless discussion. Indeed, it is unclear how the deployment of a self- protection unit would contradict the interests of any of the parties to the conflict or any other State, when this step is intended only to facilitate UNOMIG’s intensive monitoring and would contribute to peace in the region. While categorically condemning terrorist acts, regardless of the motives or where these acts might come from, we support the creation of joint investigative teams with clearly defined mandates of action. The turn of events in Abkhazia, Georgia, has shown that some important aspects should be touched upon. First among these is the development of economic programmes of post-conflict peace-building to promote the peace process. We already have an example of the successful implementation of such an approach in the settlement of the Georgian-Ossetian conflict. The implementation of the economic programme in close cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has brought about the realization of a number of important projects for the reconstruction of the social and economic infrastructure in the conflict zone and, most importantly, has activated the mechanism of the return of refugees to their homes. Recently, we have embarked upon the implementation of the subsequent stage of the programme, which has been financed by the European Union. Secondly, for the success of the peace process, we deem it necessary to formulate and effectively implement confidence-building measures between the parties to the conflict. To this end, and for the implementation of the measures formulated and the coordination of work in this direction, we believe it would be reasonable to actively engage the joint United Nations-Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Human Rights Office in Sukhumi. The third aspect is the grave humanitarian situation existing in internal conflicts, such as the one in Abkhazia, Georgia. I refer to the fate of hundreds of thousands of 15 refugees and internally displaced persons. We regret that the rights of the internally displaced persons are not protected by an international act. President Shevardnadze has called upon the world community to mark 1998, the year of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, by elaborating a comprehensive plan for the creation of an effective international mechanism for the protection of the rights of internally displaced persons throughout the world, including their political rights, the right to protect their property and the right to return to their homes. In this regard, we actively support the proposal of the Secretary- General concerning the creation of an organizational structure for the protection of the rights of displaced persons. When discussing the creation of a global model of security for the twenty-first century, we have to admit that the post-confrontational world is not yet secure, and the problem of separatism is not the only threat against which we have to consolidate our efforts. We cannot but express our concern over the expansion of the zone of nuclear proliferation. The nuclear tests in South Asia have clearly made this threat far more ominous. Therefore, we call upon all States to display goodwill and a commitment to peace, and to join the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Efforts to quell the hotbeds of the so-called local conflicts have so far been unsuccessful. Georgia is deeply concerned at the developments in Kosovo, and especially in the north Caucasus region, namely, in Chechnya, Dagestan and across the border of North Ossetia and Ingushetia. Terrorism, with all its bloody manifestations, poses a threat both to the region and to the world as a whole. Unfortunately, Georgia has also had its fair share of terrorism. The assassination attempt against the President of Georgia was aimed at the destabilization of the country and of the entire region. These and the recent terrorist acts against the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania require an intensification in the fight against terrorism. Therefore, we must actively support any efforts to do away with this evil. As we usher in the next millennium, it is impossible not to touch upon the problems of economic development and economic security. The process of economic globalization raises the question of a new role for the United Nations as a universal institution which would effectively contribute to the development of national economies and ensure economic security at both the regional and the global level. All this is especially urgent for the post-Communist countries with economies in transition. Since restoring its statehood in 1991, Georgia has been on a difficult road, having gone from chaos to stability and from total economic collapse to development. This became possible through democratic change and economic reforms. We have come to believe that the successful transition of the newly independent States to the market economy depends entirely on their integration into the international economic system through regional and interregional cooperation. A clear example of the implementation of a large-scale programme of economic cooperation is the revival of historic Silk Road. The Summit of the Transport Corridor: Europe-Caucasia-Asia (TRACECA) member States, held recently at Baku, Azerbaijan, emphasized that the idea of an alternative roadway for the Central Asian region through the south Caucasian corridor has already turned into a significant system stretching across the whole Euro-Asian continent. The economic cooperation of the Black Sea basin countries is also very important. This area was recently transformed into a regional economic organization, having impressive potential and far-reaching plans. In the course of the formation of a new world order, the main responsibility for international peace and security rests with the United Nations. An important step would be the reform of the Security Council in accordance with the new geopolitical realities. In this regard, we reiterate our position concerning the inclusion of Germany and Japan among the permanent members of the Council. We also support the increase in the number of non-permanent seats, providing one for the States of the Eastern European region. We also advocate more transparency in the work of the Security Council, including participation in its closed meetings by those non-member States whose problems happen to be the subject of the Council’s discussions. We are aware of the importance the United Nations attaches to the timely contributions of its Member States. In this regard, despite its economic constraints, Georgia will do everything in its capacity to cover its indebtedness to the Organization. 16 Special attention should be accorded to the further development of United Nations peacekeeping operations. We believe that the time has come to further develop and institutionalize the system of standby arrangements. The creation of the Multinational United Nations Standby Forces High-Readiness Brigade can play an important role in preserving the peace. The same is true of the establishment of a well-equipped headquarters from which to identify potential hotbeds of tension. Georgia has always advocated the establishment of an International Criminal Court and actively participated in the Rome Conference. We believe that the establishment of this permanent jurisdictional body will ensure that gross violations of human rights and crimes against humanity no longer go unpunished. Like many previous speakers, in my statement I have resorted to such expressions as “new challenges” and “new threats” in the post-confrontational world. But at the same time, the new era opens before us new and boundless horizons and creates new opportunities in the formation of a new world order. We believe that only by joint efforts and common political will can we cope with these challenges and realize all these opportunities.  I have the honour to extend to the President the congratulations of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. We are confident that his wise leadership and vast diplomatic experience in international affairs will contribute to strengthening the role of the Organization in the world today. I also wish to pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, for the distinguished manner in which he directed the work of the previous session. We also wish to express our deep appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his endeavours to maintain peace, security and stability in the world. As we stand at the threshold of a new millennium, the international community is witnessing radical changes in international relations, the implications of which are reflected in the lives of peoples. The various aspects of openness and globalization embodied in some of those changes have not been comprehensive in their positive aspects, but have resulted in widely divergent levels of economic and social development among States and have promoted the emergence of new patterns of problems that require radical joint international solutions to contain and deal with them. There is now an increased awareness in the world of the inevitability of renewing and developing the United Nations as the essential international tool for dealing with current world problems and achieving balance, transparency and justice in international relations. Consequently, we support the positions of the Non- Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 regarding these vital issues, particularly the questions within the purview of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, and the reform of the Security Council and enlargement of its membership. We also call for strengthening coordination, cooperation and dialogue between the United Nations and regional organizations in order to mobilize and complement joint international efforts to deal with many issues on the agenda. The world has seen positive efforts in the area of international law, the most important of which were reflected in the conclusion of a number of international conventions. The latest of these efforts was the establishment in Rome of an International Criminal Court, which we regard as an important step that will contribute to supporting the principles of human rights worldwide. We also call for reactivating the role of the International Court of Justice, which is the essential legal instrument for settling disputes between States. Political events in the world, and particularly in the Arab Gulf region, have proved that radical solutions to regional disputes can only be achieved through peaceful means and methods based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. Proceeding from this belief, and true to those principles, the United Arab Emirates has adopted a wise policy in its quest for a peaceful solution to the question of the occupation by the Islamic Republic of Iran of its three islands — Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa — which form an integral part of our national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The continued consolidation by Iran of its illegal occupation of those islands and the imposition of a policy of fait accompli through numerous military and civilian measures designed to change their historical, demographic and legal characteristics are a source of grave tension and concern in the region. This runs counter to good- neighbourly relations, peaceful coexistence and confidence-building, as well as to the Charters of both the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference. Such actions are also incompatible with the approaches taken by the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which call for the settlement of existing disputes by peaceful means in order to achieve permanent security and stability in the region and strengthen relations and common interests between the States members of the Gulf Cooperation Council and Iran. 22 Accordingly, once again from this rostrum we appeal to the Government of friendly Iran to demonstrate a serious political will and accept our genuinely peaceful initiative, supported by all fraternal and friendly States, either to engage with us in dialogue and enter into bilateral negotiations that would address the legal and historical background of this question, not just its formalities, or accept resort to the International Court of Justice with a view to reaching a just and permanent settlement conducive to terminating the Iranian occupation of our three islands. Once again we reaffirm that our call for solving this dispute peacefully emanates from the nature of our historical relations with Iran and proceeds from our commitment to the essential principles governing international relations. This is also in the interest of preserving peace, security and stability in our region and throughout the world. The United Arab Emirates renews its support for all peaceful efforts and endeavours by the Secretary-General of the United Nations towards resumption of the activities of the Special Commission in Iraq. But we consider it necessary, in order to avoid any further escalation or renewed tensions in the region, and in the light of the importance of preserving the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq and non-interference in its international affairs, to continue upgrading the food-for-oil programme and improving its operation in order to meet the humanitarian needs of the fraternal Iraqi people and to alleviate its ceaseless suffering. At the same time, we urge the Iraqi Government to fully implement all the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy particularly those relating to the release of the prisoners of war and detainees, citizens of sisterly Kuwait and other States, and to complete the restitution of Kuwaiti property so as to ensure the lifting of the sanctions imposed on Iraq and to enable it to resume its natural role at the regional and international levels. The Middle East peace process is at a dangerous stalemate on all its tracks as a result of the adoption by the Israeli Government of a policy of gradual recanting on all the obligations and undertakings it has assumed under this process. The most dangerous aspect of that policy is that Government’s resolve to proceed with implementing its plans for building more Jewish settlements in the occupied Palestinian and other Arab territories, particularly in the city of Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan. It daily perpetrates atrocious and inhuman crimes against the Palestinian and other Arab peoples, which constitutes a flagrant violation of the basic principles on which that process and the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 are based. Aware of the danger inherent in the continuation of these illegal Israeli acts, we believe there is a need for effective action by the international community — in particular, the co-sponsors of the peace process and the European Union — to bring additional pressure to bear on Israel to force it to comply with its legal obligations and to demand that it resume the negotiations, without preconditions, on the different tracks of the peace process, on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the principle of land for peace. We also express our unceasing support for the Palestinian people in their quest for self-determination and their legitimate aspiration to establish their independent State on their national soil, with Jerusalem as its capital. Similarly, we support the position of the Government of Lebanon, demanding that Israel implement fully Security Council resolution 425 (1978), which calls on Israel to end unconditionally its military occupation of the south of Lebanon and its western Bekaa valley without condition. The establishment of a zone free of all kinds of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East and Arab Gulf regions is a requirement that complements the peace process and represents an essential factor in the security and stability of those regions. Accordingly, the international community should demand that the Government of Israel accede to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and subject its nuclear installations to the control and safeguards regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency. International measures which so far have been achieved in the area of world disarmament have not been global in their coverage, especially since we are witnessing an arms race and testing of nuclear and other proscribed weapons. Such developments will not lead to the settlement of existing disputes between States, but, rather, to an imbalance in regional security, as is the case between India and Pakistan and in other regions. We therefore urge both friendly countries to exercise self-restraint, renounce the use of force and resume dialogue and negotiations with a view to reducing tensions and solving their current disputes peacefully in a manner that will serve the interests of security and stability in that region. We also call upon the nuclear- weapon States, and those in possession of such dangerous weapons, to reconsider their policies, to refrain from applying double standards and to promote the adoption of equal measures for confidence-building among States. Serious steps must be taken by the United Nations to deal with this shortcoming in a way that contributes to the creation of a peaceful and stable world free from tension 23 and from the threat or use of such prohibited weapons and their damaging effects on humanity. While we appreciate the efforts of the United Nations peacekeeping forces, in cooperation with the regional organizations, to deal with and contain conflicts and civil and regional wars in certain parts of the world, we are still concerned about the failure to contain several crises in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, Somalia, the Great Lakes region, Angola and other hotbeds of tension. Recent examples are the situations between Ethiopia and Eritrea and between Iran and Afghanistan, as well as that in Kosovo, where the human rights of Muslims are being flagrantly violated by the Yugoslav Serb forces, whose actions we strongly condemn as contradicting legally binding international norms and principles. The United Nations, and the Security Council in particular, must assume their responsibilities in putting an end to such conflicts and violations and should promote the participation of regional organizations in finding adequate peaceful solutions to those problems. We also call upon the parties concerned to cooperate in such efforts by demonstrating the political will necessary to settle their disputes by peaceful means. The United Arab Emirates strongly condemns the terrorist acts that were carried out recently in some African States, resulting in heavy losses of lives and property. On the basis of ethical and humanitarian responsibility, the international community should intensify its efforts to protect civilians and their rights and to confront the phenomenon of terrorism, regardless of its origin or form. However, combating this dangerous phenomenon should not be carried out on a unilateral basis or through indiscriminate military revenge, which destroys lives and property, but through joint international action within the framework of the United Nations in order to ensure the elimination of all the root causes and manifestations of terrorism and thereby preserve the security and stability of societies and the territorial integrity of States. The world economic and financial environment continues to undergo numerous challenges which have varying implications for development. Despite the liberalization of trade, the open markets and the globalization of the economy that have characterized international relations, developing countries, representing a majority of the population of this planet, are still facing a multitude of problems especially together with the exacerbation of unemployment, illiteracy and poverty, in addition to debts and the cost of servicing them, declining humanitarian and development assistance which have become a heavy burden on many of those States, particularly the least developed countries. As a result, their development problems have increased, and that in turn has led to the creation of a state of instability and social disintegration. Recent economic and financial crises in South-East Asia and other regions not only pose challenges to sustainable development, but also demonstrate that there are clear imbalances in the world monetary, economic and trade systems. Therefore, we call for the development of global economic and financial strategies to remedy the real causes of this phenomenon in order to achieve stability in the world financial, economic and trade systems. This will also require the reform of international development and financial institutions to enable them to adapt to the changing economic situation in the world and effectively contribute to addressing many of those problems. That in turn will require the initiation of comprehensive and objective North-South dialogue, which should lead to the fulfilment of the goals shared by both the developing and developed countries. In conclusion, I hope that the deliberations of the Assembly at this session will succeed in reaching positive resolutions that address our concerns as they are reflected on the agenda for this session for the benefit, prosperity, security and stability of our States and peoples.  It is my special pleasure to congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti, as the honoured representative of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, on his election to preside over the fifty- third session of the General Assembly, and to extend to him the full cooperation of the Barbados delegation. I wish also to express our deep appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his effective leadership and management of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly — the reform Assembly. This fifty-third session, which is coming to a close at the dawn of the twenty-first century, compels us to focus on the preparedness of the United Nations for the challenges of the new millennium. It could well be a historic session, if it resolves to equip and re-energize the Organization to seize this great moment. The process of global reform is under way. Barbados strongly supports the proposals of the Secretary-General, particularly those aimed at improving the Organization?s efficiency and effectiveness. My delegation is pleased with the encouraging start to this process. We would caution, however, against reforms that are driven unduly by staff reduction targets or predetermined by budgetary constraints. To do so could well jeopardize implementation of the very Programmes of Action of the global conferences — from Rio to Rome — which constitute the global priorities endorsed by Member States. Meaningful reform also obliges us to come to terms with the financial crisis which has constrained the Organization far too long, injuring its integrity and necessitating the use of creative accounting methods to keep it afloat. Prolonged non-payment of arrears by the largest contributor is not a proud legacy to the United Nations of the twenty-first century. Let us put this Organization on a sound financial footing through prompt 29 settlement of arrears, without conditions, consistent with our Charter obligations. Reform of the Security Council is also a key imperative if the United Nations is to remain relevant in the twenty-first century. In particular, the Council must better reflect the Organization?s current membership, and it must conduct its deliberations with greater transparency. The growing threat to global peace and security has put the Organization?s capacity to cope under considerable stress, underscoring the urgent need to streamline and modernize its peacekeeping machinery. We envisaged that the end of the cold war would usher in a new era of peace and stability, but the changed nature of conflict has found the Organization?s traditional machinery ill-equipped and the political will to act severely constrained, even in the face of unthinkable crimes against humanity. That is why my delegation hails the successful outcome of the recent Conference of Plenipotentiaries held in Rome, resulting in the creation of a permanent International Criminal Court. This landmark Statute is a fitting complement to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, whose fiftieth anniversary we celebrate this year. We are pleased to recall that it was the delegation of Trinidad and Tobago that introduced the item on the creation of an international criminal court at the forty-fourth session of the Assembly, in 1989. The post-cold-war world has not become a safer place. New eruptions of strife and the intractability of old conflicts have worsened the fragile political situation in many developing countries. Such instability has diverted energies and resources from the policy priorities of sustainable development and poverty reduction. Ninety percent of today?s conflicts take place within countries, not between countries. And the majority of casualties are civilians, not soldiers; thus the heightened international concern with the loss of life and disability of thousands of innocent victims every year. Barbados therefore joined 121 States in Ottawa last December in signing the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti- Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. Its entry into force by 1 March 1999 will come not a moment too soon. Barbados recognizes the growing danger under which United Nations peacekeepers carry out their duties and laments the recent loss of life at a number of stations. We appeal to all parties to conflicts to respect the neutral role of these brave and dedicated servants of peace, and turn to reconciliation and compromise; only then will they be able to foster the domestic stability that is so critical for sustained economic growth and for improving the living standards of their people. The widening scene of strife and instability threatens global peace and security on a number of fronts. Stalled negotiations between Israel and Palestine have renewed our anxiety about the prospects for peace in a region weary of conflict. The arm of terrorism has now reached countries hitherto spared from this scourge. International trafficking in illegal drugs and arms — in particular, small arms — poses the most serious threat to democracy and society in small States. Nuclear tests have created new fears about the proliferation issue. We will continue to support the goals of non-proliferation, leading to the elimination of all nuclear weapons. Barbados will continue to condemn, in the strongest terms, all acts of terrorism. We will work assiduously with regional partners, the United Nations International Drug Control Programme, and the international community to implement the Barbados Programme of Action to fight the scourge of drug-trafficking. The lesson of this security situation is clear. Remedies are beyond the capacity of individual countries, even the most developed. The reality of global interdependence demands a greater commitment to collective security goals and better coordination of actions against the global security threat. I now turn briefly to another dimension of the global security problem — namely, human security. In this connection, let me acknowledge the debt of gratitude which developing countries owe to the distinguished Pakistani economist, the late Mahbub ul Haq, my friend and colleague. More than any other, he made the human condition central to modern development thinking, especially through his pioneering work in the Human Development Report series of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). His intellectual contribution to the debate on sustainable development and poverty reduction was substantial. It focused policy attention on people, and in particular on the plight of more than one fifth of the world?s population that lives in conditions of poverty and hopelessness. This concern with the right to development for all people should be a central component of the discussion on globalization and liberalization and the impact of these 30 phenomena on developing countries, especially the poorest countries. We believe the United Nations must be the conscience of the international community on behalf of the poor and vulnerable in this global conversation. My delegation therefore welcomed the recent high- level dialogue of the General Assembly on the social and economic impact of globalization and interdependence and their policy implications. We found the discussions instructive. There was broad agreement that the process of globalization has opened new possibilities for faster economic growth and improved living standards through the free flow of capital across borders. However, many developing countries have not yet shared in the fruits of this process. And while the benefits are obvious, the associated risks, though grave, are less evident. Who would have envisaged that the East Asian economies would be engulfed by a financial crisis of such a scale, and to such a degree of volatility and dislocation as to threaten the very fabric of their societies and, indeed, the global economy? While many questions have been raised about the pros and cons of unrestricted capital flows which underlie this crisis, and the role of the Bretton Woods institutions in this global order, reassuring answers are few. Clearly, the crisis points in part to deficiencies in the global architecture and governance of finance. We discern a world economy so radically altered from that of even a decade ago that we are obliged to focus on the deficit in our understanding of how it works, and on how to design a new structure for its orderly governance. Since there is as yet no settled approach to adjustment policy towards globalization — in particular, measures to protect the poor and vulnerable groups — the voice of the United Nations must be raised in debate on these critical areas of enquiry. Small island developing States, given their vulnerability to both environmental and economic shocks, are following with much anxiety these developments in the global economy. We welcome a number of ongoing studies on the vulnerability of small island developing States. In December 1997, an Ad Hoc Expert Group Meeting on Vulnerability Indices for Small Island Developing States, convened by the United Nations Secretariat, concluded that as a group, small island developing countries are more vulnerable than other groups of developing countries. More recently, a high-level committee established by the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, and chaired by The Right Honourable Owen Arthur, Prime Minister of Barbados, held consultations with key international agencies, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization (WTO), on the vulnerability of small island developing States, particularly in the current global situation. As if to reinforce this reality, just a few days ago hurricane Georges dealt us a brutal reminder, wiping out in a matter of hours economic growth which took years to accumulate. We lament the heavy loss of life and the widespread destruction of property in a number of our sister islands of the Caribbean, as well as in the southern United States. We join in the appeal for urgent international assistance. Barbados shares with developing countries the growing concern about the impact of globalization and liberalization, given its limited resource base and technical capacity. We recognize that adaptation to this irreversible process is an imperative, not an option, and that countries will pay a high price for policy of inaction. Barbados is therefore implementing a broad program of social, economic and institutional reform to better manage rapid global change while deepening its integration into the regional economy, especially the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). The recent conference of heads of Government, held in Saint Lucia from 30 June to 4 July, marked the silver jubilee of CARICOM, and gave further impetus to the process towards a single market and economy. In response to the increasing policy demands of globalization, CARICOM States have established technical machinery, under high-level political direction, to underpin regional negotiations under way within the hemisphere. These negotiations will lead to a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) in 2005. This will be the largest and most differentiated of regional trading blocks. We recognize that technical support will be required on an ongoing basis to ensure that small States develop the capacity to negotiate effectively, share equitably in the benefits of trade and secure transition arrangements on entry that will minimize economic dislocation. At the wider international level, Barbados was pleased to host in May 1998 the sixty-seventh session of the Council of Ministers of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP), as well as the meeting of the twenty-third joint ACP-European Union (EU) Council of Ministers. These consultations focused on future ACP-EU relations, in particular, the structure of cooperation following the expiration of the Lomé Convention in the year 2000. Following those gatherings, Barbados assumed the presidency of the ACP Council of Ministers, which will 31 today, 29 September, launch formal negotiations for successor arrangements to the Lomé Convention. Here again, the participation of CARICOM will be bolstered by the technical work and direction of the regional negotiating mechanism. CARICOM States will seek opportunities for fruitful cooperation and information-sharing with other ACP members during the course of these critical negotiations. Even a passing reference to ACP-EU relations triggers our concern about the long-standing and still unresolved issue of banana exports from CARICOM States to the European Union. The WTO decision on this matter, if implemented, will have a devastating impact on affected countries? economies and on the livelihood of large sections of their populations. Moreover, it would create uncertainty about investment and the overall prospects for development in the region. CARICOM States remain deeply seized of this question and hope that a satisfactory solution of this grievance can be reached soon. My delegation looks forward to the special session of the General Assembly in September 1999, at which the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States will be reviewed. Within the framework of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), we will participate actively in the preparatory process, including the planned donors? conference in February 1999. We believe that conference will provide a useful opportunity to foster support for a portfolio of priority projects that will boost implementation of this Programme over the next several years. We attach similar importance to the meeting of the Commission on Sustainable Development scheduled for April 1999, which will help deepen our preparation for the special session. That meeting will focus on sustainable tourism and oceans, the virtual lifeline of small island developing States. It will underline our concern with the preservation and sustainable management of our marine resources and highlight our anxiety over the use of the Caribbean Sea for the trans-shipment of nuclear and other hazardous materials through this fragile marine ecosystem. That is why CARICOM States will seek recognition of the Caribbean Sea as a special area in the context of sustainable development. The special session will be an important landmark in the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action. Barbados is proud of this international Programme that bears its name. It remains a sound blueprint for policies which support the sustainable development of small island developing States, taking into account their special needs and vulnerabilities. We believe that with the continued cooperation and support of our international partners we can strengthen the implementation of the Programme of Action and consolidate its long-term viability. Let me conclude by saying that the fifty-third session of the General Assembly has before it many critical issues for consideration. My delegation believes, however, that none has higher priority than renewed commitment to this indispensable Organization and to the strengthening of its capacity to meet the challenges of the new millennium. Small island developing States believe deeply in the United Nations. It has placed their vulnerability firmly into the consciousness of the international community. But more than that, this is the only institution which embodies the goals of peace and security, sustainable development, democracy and social justice, which define our common humanity. Barbados pledges its full commitment and support to this universal mission.  Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Opertti on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. I am confident that with his vast experience and diplomatic skills in the service of his country, Uruguay, he will be able to steer our deliberations to a fruitful outcome. May I also take this opportunity to express my delegation’s sincere thanks and appreciation to Mr. Udovenko, of Ukraine, for the admirable way in which he presided over the last session of the General Assembly. The global situation continues to be in a state of flux. Six years after the end of the cold war, the world is no more the safe place that we were led to believe it would be. Old conflicts stubbornly persist, while new ones have emerged. The picture is no better on the disarmament front. Although the signing of the Convention on landmines is a laudable achievement in the field of conventional weapons, the situation on the nuclear disarmament front remains bleak. There has been little or no progress in nuclear disarmament. Indeed, the situation has been aggravated by nuclear tests conducted by two non- signatories of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), posing a grave challenge to the disarmament process. The international community must make every effort to check further erosion of nuclear disarmament regimes, while strengthening and promoting universal adherence to them. In this regard, the nuclear Powers have a special responsibility. The situation in the Middle East continues to be a source of grave concern. The dismal lack of progress in efforts to bring the Palestine-Israel peace process back on track is a matter of deep disappointment. It portends adverse implications for international peace and security. Lest the positive achievements of recent years be dissipated, all parties concerned must exert every effort to build on the peace agreements that were painstakingly negotiated. Only their continued active engagement in the peace process can influence developments in the right direction. It should be stressed, however, that peace and stability in the region cannot be attained by delaying and frustrating the realization of the just aspirations of the Palestinian people to an independent and sovereign homeland. We are dismayed by the ongoing unresolved conflict in Afghanistan. The contending parties must realize that a long-term solution to the conflict can be reached not through military means, but through negotiations leading to genuine national reconciliation. We call on them to set aside provincial or sectarian interests, eschew violence and seriously pursue a peaceful resolution of the conflict, in the larger interests of their country and their people. We condemn the violence directed at the personnel of the United Nations, humanitarian organizations and countries concerned. On a slightly more positive note, Malaysia is pleased about the successful conclusion of the national elections 2 in Cambodia, in which the international community once again played a constructive role. We urge all political parties in Cambodia to close ranks and resolve outstanding problems through dialogue, in the larger national interests of Cambodia. The objective should be the early formation of a Government that fully reflects the wish of the Cambodian people for national reconciliation, pluralism and development, and which will enable Cambodia to partake in constructive regional cooperation with its neighbours. Recent events have once again emphasized to the international community the continuing threat to peace and security posed by terrorism. Here I refer in particular to the terrorist attacks in Kenya and Tanzania, which resulted in the tragic deaths and injuries of many innocent people. Malaysia reiterates its condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Malaysia will join in efforts to combat terrorism through the strengthening of international cooperation in various fields on the basis of the supremacy of the rule of law. There should be increased cooperation among police and other security and law enforcement agencies of Member States. At the same time, at the political level, the international community must work towards inculcating the new global culture of peace that the Secretary-General has so eloquently articulated. Malaysia believes that violence begets violence, and the victims will unfortunately be innocent civilians. Indeed, in a world armed with nuclear weapons where the danger of nuclear terrorism is ever present, every effort should be made not only to keep terrorism at bay through enhanced international cooperation but — and this is equally important — to address the root causes. While terrorism may not be entirely eliminated, understanding the reasons for its continued existence will be an important step towards combating it. Continued instability in parts of Africa is of major concern to our Organization. Malaysia welcomes the increased attention given to Africa by the United Nations and its specialized agencies. Malaysia particularly welcomes the initiative taken by the Security Council to highlight the special problems of Africa in the Council earlier this year and in the Council’s ministerial meeting on African issues held last Thursday, 24 September. Furthermore, Malaysia welcomes and will actively participate in a similar discussion on Africa at this session of the General Assembly. We are convinced that these discussions will contribute to a greater understanding of the interrelated problems of peace, security and development faced by many African countries. Hopefully, they will lead to more focused and coordinated programmes of international action to overcome those problems. Given the continuing disadvantaged position of Africa, there is a need for sustained efforts on the part of our Organization and its specialized agencies, as well as traditional and new partners of Africa, to assist African countries in their development needs. I am pleased to say that Malaysia, for its part, has been able to make a modest contribution in these efforts through technical cooperation and trade and investment in a number of African countries. Malaysia will continue to do so, within its limited resources, in the spirit of South-South cooperation and solidarity with Africa. As we grapple with questions of international peace and security, we should be equally concerned by the current state of the global economy. Indeed, we see that the most imminent threat to the well-being of our region today is not political, ideological or military, but economic. It is clearly evident that the financial crisis that descended on East Asian countries over a year ago has brought social misery, political instability and economic turmoil. In certain countries there is now massive unemployment. Economic growth has been severely curtailed, and in fact has contracted. Virtually overnight, the hard-earned gains of decades of hard work, careful planning and prudent management have been wiped out. Millions of people in the region most severely affected by the crisis find that their place is now below the poverty line. Their right to live a life that is free from the scourge of poverty and to have a decent standard of living with some basic necessities has been trampled by the manipulators of the currency markets. Indeed, the super- rich have impoverished the poor. It is ironic that this has happened in the year when we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Though they are pursuing policy responses that are in line with International Monetary Fund requirements, the economies of the affected countries have not recovered. Instead, the contagious effects of the crisis have spread to other regions and are affecting the world economy. We may be sliding towards world recession. We may even be on the verge of a global depression if urgent steps are not taken through international collaboration and cooperation to halt the slide and reverse the trend. While various factors contributed to the crisis, we have no doubt that the financial turmoil was triggered by speculative attacks on the East Asian currencies and the resultant reversal of capital flows. The crisis reveals flaws in the market mechanism and raises questions about the relative benefits of liberalization and globalization. Unless 3 these flaws are effectively addressed, the threat of a global depression as devastating as the one that hit the world in the 1930s could confront us. The international community has to act urgently to reform the international financial system to ensure against massive currency attacks, manipulations and frequently excessive fluctuations. It has been said that the markets would punish those countries which do not possess proper financial structures and disciplines and which lack transparency. But the international financial market itself lacks transparency. In today’s financial system, currency valued at more than $1.2 trillion is bought and sold every 24 hours. This trade is largely carried out without any clear rules, and the very Governments whose currencies are being traded are left to fend for themselves in trying to defend the value of their currencies. There is no system of surveillance, no open reporting of any kind and no regulating authority such as the World Trade Organization for this most lucrative trade in the coveted commodity that is money itself. It is now most urgent that the international financial market be reformed. More than that, significant changes should be made to the international financial architecture. Malaysia has been advocating the need for change over the last year. Initially, this call went unheeded. In September 1997, our Prime Minister said in Hong Kong, “A certain degree of uncertainty is fine, but an absolutely uncertain financial world is no good for anyone except of course for those who deliberately create the uncertainty.” It is clear that the situation is becoming increasingly uncertain globally. Increasingly, the experts now agree. A number of Governments also agree. The situation has clearly got out of hand. There has to be change and improvement in the international financial architecture. There must be rules to encourage greater transparency. Financial operators must abide by certain internationally accepted regulations. They must accept closer supervision so as to distinguish between genuine investors and currency speculators. There has to be an earnest effort among Governments to immediately engage in dialogues to revamp the system. We must undertake an immediate collective effort to find a comprehensive and workable solution to what is clearly now a global problem. A few developed countries cannot resolve this problem on their own. A few developed countries cannot forever remain rich and prosperous if more than two thirds of the world’s countries remain poor and socially and politically unstable. This is the time to enter into a genuine process of North-South dialogue on an issue of great interest to both. Malaysia welcomes the call by President Clinton for a special discussion in Washington on the financial and economic crisis that the world is facing today. Meanwhile, in the absence of reforms or internationally well-tested formulas or guidelines, Malaysia has taken steps to impose currency and capital controls in order to insulate its economy from currency uncertainties while at the same time continuing to be active in international trade and to welcome foreign investment. While countries In East Asia are doing their best to overcome their problems in their respective ways and to ameliorate the plight of their people, it is important that the lessons of East Asia be learned by the rest of the developing world. It is equally important that the international community find consensus to formulate necessary ground rules to keep in check the rapacious nature of financial speculators and manipulators whose only motivation is profit-making and profit-taking. This Assembly, and in particular the Economic and Social Council, can and should also consider this important issue. The United Nations can put its moral weight behind the call for regulating these speculative activities in the interest of protecting or insulating vulnerable developing economies. In an increasingly interdependent and borderless world, the globalization of trade and commerce is moving apace. However, many developing countries can barely cope with this, given their weak domestic, economic, financial and legal structures. Globalization may be desirable and, perhaps, inevitable and unstoppable as a process and trend. Nevertheless, it is important to realize that unless the developing countries are given time to build up their structures and are actively assisted in the process, they will not be able to participate meaningfully in global free trade, still less compete with their partners from the developed world. In such a situation, globalized free trade would be a patently unfair form of world trade, with the odds stacked against developing countries. Indeed, it would be a continuing form of exploitation of the weak and poor nations by those that are powerful and rich. Needless to say, in the wake of the sad experience of the East Asian economies, the faith of many developing countries in globalization has been very much shaken and diminished. Consequently, many developing countries view the prospect of further liberalizing their 4 economies with great caution and trepidation. It is Malaysia’s conviction that as we approach the new millennium, relations among States should be based on a new paradigm predicated not only on equal sovereignty but also on respect for dignity and mutuality of interests and benefits. Only on that basis will we be able to reap the full potential of globalization through genuine international dialogue and cooperation. The enjoyment of human rights is one of the most important principles in the maintenance of justice and peace in the world. The fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights this year affords us an opportunity to reflect on both accomplishments and failures in realizing the commitments enshrined in the Declaration. The promise in the Declaration to end cruelty and injustice still remains largely unfulfilled. Similarly, the promise to provide a decent living to all has been threatened by the negative effects of globalization and the inadequate attention given to economic, social and cultural rights. This fiftieth anniversary coincides with the review of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. The review will provide us with an opportunity to make a thorough and honest assessment of the successes and failures in implementing the commitments made five years ago. It would be timely for discussions to focus not only on rights but also on obligations. It is imperative that the conferment of rights should be linked to the fulfilment of obligations and clearly defined duties and responsibilities. The imbalance in emphasis between political and civil rights on the one hand and economic, social and cultural rights on the other has to be clearly addressed in order for the promotion, protection and enjoyment of all human rights to be fully achieved. The right to development, recognized as universal, inalienable and an integral part of fundamental human rights, has not been fully realized. There is still no effective international cooperation to create a true environment of equitable economic relations which would facilitate the realization of this goal. We may recall that the Secretary-General appropriately designated the last session of this Assembly as the reform Assembly. He tabled his package of reform proposals for our consideration and appropriate action. After much debate, many of these proposals were approved and are now in various stages of implementation. It is hoped that with the implementation of the reform package the Organization will become more action-oriented and more focused on and responsive to the needs of Member States. Certainly, greater rationalization of the plans and actions and more effective management will lead to increased efficiency in programme implementation as well as to better and more effective and efficient utilization of human resources. Let us continue to give our strong support to the Secretary-General in his continuing efforts to fully and effectively implement his reform proposals. Let us also extend our support to his efforts to strengthen the Organization in ways that will benefit all Member States. Certainly, a positive contribution in this regard is to ensure our continued financial support to the Organization, thereby easing its burdens at a time of increasing demands being made upon it. The establishment of the proposed Revolving Credit Fund might help ease the financial crisis of the United Nations temporarily. In the long term, however, the only effective way of resolving the problem is through the timely payment by Member States of their dues. What is most disappointing, however, is the lack of any progress in an important aspect of the reform of our Organization. I refer to the discussions on the reform and restructuring of the Security Council in the high-level Working Group of the General Assembly. Individual Member States, as well as groups of States, have made many important proposals on various aspects of the reform and restructuring of the Council, from its enlargement and composition to its working methods, including the use of the veto. Regrettably, all these proposals aimed at making the Council more representative, democratic, transparent and accountable, have not received the desired consensus. Clearly what is lacking is not ideas and proposals but the necessary political will on the part of Member States, particularly those with strong views on specific aspects of reform of the Council. If the reform and restructuring of the Council continue to elude us in its sixth year of discussion in the Working Group, we have only ourselves to blame for our inability to demonstrate our reasonableness, our goodwill and the necessary compromises required from all of us to break the current impasse. Additional years of continuing with the sterile debate in the Working Group will only increase the creeping sense of cynicism and pessimism among Member States, which would be seriously detrimental to the reform process. As its contribution to the reform debate, Malaysia reiterates its call for a comprehensive reform and 5 restructuring of the Security Council. We continue to advocate enlargement of the Council in both categories of its membership, permanent and non-permanent, circumscribing, if not totally abolishing, the use of the veto and improving the working methods of the Council, which should include increased transparency, accountability and participation by the larger membership of the Organization through more open debates on issues of importance to the international community. As the discussions in the Working Group enter their sixth year, it is the earnest hope of my delegation that there will be increased focus, seriousness and urgency on the part of Member States in arriving at a consensus. Otherwise, we will lose forever the remaining window of opportunity to reform the Council. We should remind ourselves that we do not have the luxury of time and that this opportunity for a comprehensive reform of the Council, if not realized, may not present itself again for many years to come. In conclusion, let me reiterate Malaysia’s belief in the importance of these annual debates in the General Assembly and their relevance to our continuing efforts to enhance international cooperation and collaboration at the multilateral level. The statements by Member States in this Assembly serve to inform us and challenge us to further action in pursuit of our common goals. In the final analysis, the future viability of the United Nations will depend on the perception by Member States of the continued relevance of the United Nations to them and on their continuing support for the Organization. The word “globalization” did not appear in dictionaries of the English language 30 years ago. Globalization is now a reality, but multitudes do not benefit. To assist those peoples suffering its negative consequences, the United Nations requires skilled and innovative leadership. The General Assembly is fortunate that Mr. Opertti has been elected to lead it at its fifty-third session. His service to his country and intergovernmental organizations at the highest levels and his experience as a teacher, scholar and practitioner of international law, with extensive work in economic development and trade, as well as crime prevention and the protection of children, demonstrate the understanding and patience required here. My delegation applauds the achievements of Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, President of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session who time and again demonstrated the dexterity and humour necessary for advancing the delicate process of United Nations reform, which Solomon Islands wholeheartedly supports. In the Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who continues to nurture that process, this Organization has found one of the great men of our time. We are honoured by his presence. Having often spoken strongly in favour of gender equality, my delegation rejoiced in the election of Ms. Louise Frechette as the first Deputy Secretary- General. She and the Secretary-General admirably represent the indispensable Secretariat. On the eve of the new millennium, many developing countries continue to experience difficult economic, environmental and social problems. The lack of capital resources, crushing debt, external economic shocks and the fall in development assistance retard the growth of the economies of many least developed countries. The small island developing States continue to experience growth in drug and other transborder crimes. Moreover, our people face the ever present threat of natural disaster, such as the devastating tsunami that recently struck Papua New Guinea, our nearby neighbour. We are a village people feeling the impact of globalization. The vulnerability of small island developing States to external economic shock is indeed real. Our tiny economy means a narrow human and non-human resources base and a limited domestic market. We are dangerously exposed to external economic developments in trade, capital flows and technology. Limited in our capacity to stabilize our domestic economy, we are especially sensitive to and dependent on the international situation. Our inability to effectively deal with the impacts of the Asian financial crisis demonstrates our vulnerability. The drop in my country’s export revenue further undermines our difficult financial and economic situation. Well-designed and carefully monitored international standards and codes of conduct for capital flows and private financial management are essential. Without such regulatory measures, the prospects that the least developed countries will benefit from globalization and trade liberalization remain bleak. We face even further marginalization. The Alliance for Change Government of Solomon Islands is well aware that whether we and other least developed countries succeed in effectively using the opportunities and mitigating the risks offered by the new world trading system depends largely on our success in making major macroeconomic policy reforms and overcoming deficiencies. To stimulate private sector involvement and the active participation of indigenous Solomon Islanders, the Government has launched a reform programme incorporating sound banking and financial practices conducive to economic growth and stability. The public sector is being restructured to create more efficient, responsive and accountable governmental administration. We cannot succeed, however, without significant bilateral and multilateral assistance. The experience of other economies that have undertaken similar programmes shows that the reforms can be accelerated by assured markets for traditional products as well as access to new markets and capital. Moreover, multilateral agencies such as the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) can assist significantly in enhancing competitiveness and capacity-building. Communications and information technology are, of course, essential for economic revitalization, especially so for Solomon Islands and other small island developing States remote from major markets and financial centres. My Government is committed to the development of efficient and cost-effective telecommunication networks as a catalyst for economic and social progress. We are also supporting long-distance education by radio and campaigns to reduce and eliminate illiteracy. Sustainable development and the scientific management of our forest and marine resources remain high priority matters for my Government. The 922 islands and atolls of the Solomons stretch over 1.35 million square kilometres of ocean. Fisheries are essential for our economy. Last April, Parliament enacted legislation to control the exploitation of our fish resources and to maximize the benefits for our people. Protecting the fragile marine ecosystem from pollution is a major concern. With the assistance of the UNDP, a study will soon be undertaken to assess the potential danger to the marine environment posed by the large quantity of submerged ordnance from the Second World War. Projects to encourage ecotourism as well as the processing of forest products within the Solomon Islands are being considered. The special session of the General Assembly next year to review the overall implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States promises to be an important occasion to assess the progress made in the last five years. Solomon Islands will participate actively in the preparatory work and in the seventh session of the Commission on Sustainable Development and the donors conference on small island developing States. Natural disaster remains the greatest environmental threat to the peoples of many small island nations. We face such calamities as tidal waves and volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, droughts and floods and rise of the sea level from climate warming. During the past year, shortages of water and food caused by El Niño severely affected Solomon Islands and several other countries in the region, especially where cyclones had struck earlier. Intensified international cooperation in early warning systems, disaster mitigation and management strategies are needed. We strongly support the renewal of the 2 United Nations International Decade for Disaster Reduction and related initiatives. Climate change remains an issue demanding urgent and concrete global collective attention. The Kyoto Protocol, which Solomon Islands signed a few days ago, is a positive step within the climate protection process, but it must be understood to be only one of several. Crucial actions, besides the early ratification of the Protocol by all parties, include the strengthening of emission reduction targets and commitment to agreed time frames by industrialized countries and the development and transfer of appropriate, affordable and environmentally sound technologies. International commitments to energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy sources remain key objectives. For small island developing States to meet their obligations, adequate resources must be generated through the mechanisms provided by the Protocol and the Global Environment Facility. These are priority issues for the fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, meeting in Buenos Aires next month. Other potential disasters concern us as well. The proliferation of nuclear weapons is especially troubling to my Government. Solomon Islands is committed to the elimination of these weapons and is proud of the part it took at the International Court of Justice on the issue of nuclear weapons. These instruments of terror are creating insecurity in our region. We are also committed to the elimination of biological and chemical weapons. The coming entry into force next March of the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction is splendid news indeed, and we thank Austria, Canada, Norway and South Africa for their extraordinary efforts. In our peaceful islands, the noise of any conflict resounds loudly and threateningly. We are indeed pleased by the Bougainville peace agreement, which New Zealand skilfully helped to negotiate with the important assistance of Australia, Fiji and Vanuatu. Crucial for the success of this effort was the willingness of the Government of Papua New Guinea and the other parties to work in good faith. We also thank France for agreeing to a timetable for the independence of New Caledonia. The Alliance for Change Government strongly condemns international terrorism in any form or manifestation. We deplore in the strongest terms what happened in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. Solomon Islands supports the call by previous speakers for the international community, in particular the United Nations, to take a leading role in combating terrorism. At the same time, we recognize the need to understand the conditions in which terrorism is rooted and to change them. The desperate acts of men and women have desperate causes. International partnership is also required in fighting the world’s illicit drug trade. The declaration adopted at the twentieth special session of the General Assembly calls for concrete efforts. My Government is taking the necessary steps at the national level, but the enhancement of our interdiction capabilities and the encouragement of alternative economic activities require practical international assistance. The Solomon Islands delegation participated in the preparation of the Statute of the International Criminal Court, and we applaud its adoption in Rome. The challenge before us now is to ensure its effective implementation. Half a century after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the progress achieved, although significant, is far from satisfactory for hundreds of millions of people. Many human rights do not exist, except on paper, for the over one billion persons who live in abject poverty. My Government is committed to upholding our people’s fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the Solomon Islands Constitution. We strive to maintain human dignity. Although resource constraints hinder our ability to fulfil the reporting obligations of the international instruments to which we are a party, we will not fail to meet our human rights obligations. Nor will we be silent when the rights of others are denied. We call once again for the representation and participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the United Nations and its agencies. When the General Assembly refuses to place this matter on its agenda, it denies to the nearly 22 million people of Taiwan their rights under the Charter of this Organization. It rejects the opportunity to foster peace and security in the Taiwan Strait through dialogue here at the United Nations. It turns its back on preventive diplomacy. Surely the General Assembly is better than this. The people of this politically stable, economically strong and technologically advanced democracy have amply demonstrated how much they have to offer their region and the world. With the new millennium nearly upon us, it is time to discard old patterns of thought if the Chinese motherland is to reunite peacefully. My Government will continue to appeal to the 3 United Nations to seriously consider and recognize the legitimate right of the people of the Republic of China on Taiwan to have a voice in this international arena. During the “reform Assembly”, Solomon Islands supported the proposals of the Secretary-General. My delegation actively participated in the Open-ended Working Group on the Security Council. Reform of the Council should move boldly toward greater democracy and transparency. Expansion of its membership must reflect equitable geographical representation, and close thought needs to be given to the composition of the regional groups. If the veto cannot be decently buried, it should be restricted to Chapter VII questions. The Secretary-General’s proposal for a Millennium Assembly in September 2000 to identify priorities for United Nation action is refreshing. Critical for the success of the Assembly will be the two years of international dialogue, involving the widest possible spectrum of participants, leading up to it. The dialogues must truly be dialogues and not long series of monologues in which people talk past one another. A leading candidate for one of the priorities to be adopted by the Millennium Assembly is debt forgiveness for the heavily indebted poor countries. Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom are to be commended for their recent debt-forgiving actions. We also appreciate the Nordic countries who have fulfilled their targets and commitments for official development assistance. Solomon Islands celebrated the twentieth anniversary of its independence last July. The past two decades have been difficult but peaceful. My Government wishes to acknowledge the contribution of the international community, especially our development partners, including the non-governmental organizations. We especially thank our citizens for their patience and support towards our development endeavours. We are committed to strengthening these partnerships. We must work together to meet the challenges of the next millennium successfully.  It gives me great pleasure, Sir, to extend to you my congratulations and those of the Indonesian delegation on your election to the presidency of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. I should like to assure you of our full cooperation in the discharge of your duties. To your distinguished predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, I wish to convey our felicitations for having so ably guided the fifty-second session to a successful conclusion. Let me also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his dedication to the reform and restructuring of the Organization, as well as for his determined efforts to seek a peaceful solution to conflict situations in various parts of the world. One of the great ironies of our time is that at the end of a century in which the amazing advances of science and technology could have been harnessed to effectively address the problem of poverty, scores of millions more people have slipped below the poverty line. At the same time, there has been a massive application of science and technology to increase humankindâs capacity to deal out death and destruction. Even in the best of times, humankindâs use of economic resources has not been marked by any deep sense of responsibility but rather by 22 mindless consumption that has often led to the degradation of our environment. Unfortunately squandering resources is an old habit of the human race. Today, I fear that the awesome force of globalization, itself propelled by science and technology, is also being squandered: instead of serving to unify humankind in a decisive assault against the persistent systemic problems of our time, it is being used to press the advantage of the strong over the weak, thereby widening the gap between the developed and developing world. Herein lies the tragedy of the human race: that our vast capacity to alter the planet on which we live has been matched to a parochial vision. Large and complex actions are motivated by narrow self-interest. And in the narrowness of our perspective we inflict great harm on one another. That is why the imbalances and inequities in international relations persist: we can never get rid of them until we attain that essential balance within ourselves, between the scope of our actions and that of our intentions. Yet I do not despair. Against the backdrop of a century of conflict, one human achievement shines: the founding of the United Nations. It is admittedly a flawed achievement, for after five decades it has not yet brought us the global peace that we envisaged to be its greatest promise. But it has spared us from the horrors of another world war and possibly from a nuclear holocaust. That this flawed jewel of human reason should remain to serve us in a more effective way in the next century is an imperative. Through its instrumentality, it is still possible for us to tame the dogs of war and to exorcise the spectre of poverty. Through its processes of consultation and debate, we can still attain a broadness of mind that matches the global sweep of our actions. Through the habits of cooperation and trust that it engenders among its Members and among the countless individuals and institutions that participate in its dialogues, we might yet realize our shared vision of a global civil society. But first it must be reformed, further democratized and fully empowered. The United Nations, as the central mechanism and catalyst for multilateral cooperation, must be enabled to play its mandated role in the achievement and maintenance of peace, security and development. It is therefore of the greatest importance that it be provided with the resources with which to carry on its work instead of being strapped for funds as it is now. The legal obligation of every Member State in that regard must therefore be strictly met. It is also essential that the ongoing process of reform of the United Nations be intensified, particularly with regard to the Security Council, taking into account the desire of all States from all regions to participate in its work, as well as present political, economic and demographic realities. For indeed, developing countries are grossly under-represented on the Council especially at a time when its work is focused on conflict situations in the developing world. This anomaly has to be redressed by an increase in the representation of the developing world in the permanent as well as in the non-permanent membership of the Council. The legitimacy, credibility and effectiveness of the Councilâs work depend on its representative character. Indonesia views the task of Security Council reform as a matter of urgency, but we must not be rushed into any hasty or ill-advised decisions that would be detrimental to the long-term interests of Member States. In this context, there is a need to continue and accelerate the work of the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters Related to the Security Council. If the cause of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, has not made substantive progress in recent years, it is largely because there are States that believe they have much to gain by their exclusive possession of nuclear arms. The unjustifiable privileges conferred on the nuclear-weapon States have given rise to a regime of discrimination and hypocrisy as well as a situation where non-nuclear countries wishing to enjoy the same privileges seek to become nuclear States themselves. Thus, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) has not fully met its objectives, and the imbalances and discrimination inherent to it have persisted. Regrettably, too, the second Preparatory Committee for the 2000 Review Conference failed to agree on substantive issues. Still, we must persevere and prepare ourselves for the next NPT Review Conference and focus on the inequities and imbalances inherent in the Treaty. At the same time, we urge the nuclear-weapon States to implement faithfully both the letter and spirit of agreements relating to non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. We call on all States to refrain from developing these weapons so that we may the sooner attain our ultimate objective of their total elimination. The slow pace of progress towards non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament compels us to work even harder to achieve global disarmament objectives. The convening of the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament is essential for providing new 23 political momentum that would enable and encourage the Governments and peoples of the world to move towards disarmament, including the elimination of nuclear weapons. It is therefore imperative that we take further concrete steps leading to the convening of the fourth special session. While disarmament marks time, discord is rampant in the form of armed conflicts, disputes and tensions between and within States in many parts of the globe. The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina remains a source of continuing concern for Indonesia. Hence, we reaffirm our steadfast support for the full, impartial and effective implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement. In Afghanistan, we call on the warring factions to cease hostilities and to start constructive dialogue. The protracted civil strife in that country also threatens to spill over beyond its borders. We urge the parties concerned to cooperate with the United Nations in its concerted endeavours to restore peace and stability in the region. The dire situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo calls for continued and concerted efforts in restoring peace and tranquillity. Indonesia is appalled by the terrorist bomb attacks on the American embassies in the capitals of Kenya and Tanzania that caused the death of nearly 200 people and the wounding of thousands. We reiterate our condemnation of all acts and forms of terrorism wherever they may occur and whoever perpetrates them. At the same time, we stress that we will never condone the resort to unilateral acts of aggression and violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States as a means to combat terrorism. We therefore urge all States to enhance international cooperation in the fight against terrorism while strictly observing and implementing the relevant international instruments. My delegation welcomes the recent positive developments concerning the Lockerbie incident that culminated in the adoption of Security Council resolution 1192 (1998). It is our hope that discussions will now take place between the United Kingdom, the United States and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, including on the appropriate trial arrangements. Early implementation of this resolution will hopefully lead to a definitive settlement of this issue and the lifting of sanctions imposed on Libya. In the Middle East, the situation in the occupied territories keeps deteriorating as the peace process remains in the grip of a stalemate. Israeli policies and practices of oppression and provocation have continued unabated. In a blatant attempt to change the demography of the occupied territories, Israel keeps building new settlements and expanding existing ones. More ominously, it has arbitrarily extended the administrative powers of the occupying authorities in Jerusalem beyond the cityâs borders in a bid to consolidate Israelâs hold on East Jerusalem and the West Bank and thereby entrench Jerusalem as its capital. This would pre-empt negotiations on the status of the Holy City and threaten to unravel the peace process, with grave repercussions not only for the Middle East but also beyond. Peace and stability will continue to elude the region until Israel complies with its treaty obligations and unconditionally withdraws from all occupied Arab territories in accordance with all relevant United Nations resolutions, in particular 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978). The peace process must be resumed and agreements reached must be implemented in their entirety and not selectively or conditionally. In South-East Asia, the elections held recently in Cambodia, deemed to have been generally free and fair by international observers, should now lead to the restoration of normalcy in the country. It is time that all the parties in Cambodia resolve their differences in the spirit of national reconciliation and unity in the larger interest of their country, work together toward the formation of a new government and thereby contribute to peace and stability in South-East Asia. The world economy is teetering on the brink of recession, if not already experiencing one. Economic output has slowed for the developed and developing countries alike, and growth in world trade has also decelerated. While official forecasts indicate a slowdown in the growth of world output to 2.5 per cent, any such forecasts may still be too optimistic. Only a little more than a year ago, the world economy was on a significant growth path, and the outlook was generally bright. In Asia, robust growth for decades had transformed much of the region into an economic powerhouse. Today, many of those dynamic economies are crippled. One third of the world is grappling with serious economic slowdown and the frightening possibility of a depression. In the affected countries, including Indonesia, economic turmoil has reached a devastating level, pushing their economies into recession and their people to the very edge of their endurance. Unemployment has soared, and an unacceptable number of people have slipped under the poverty line. Education has been severely affected, and food is in short supply. The experience of South-East Asian countries in this financial turmoil has shown that 24 even the most dynamic economies are vulnerable. In spite of the judicious macroeconomic policies that they adopted and the often painful structural adjustments that they carried out, the development gains they earned over the decades crumbled in the span of a few weeks. The lesson of this debacle is that the market is driven by sentiments as much as fundamentals, by perception rather than facts alone. These adverse aspects of globalization have furthermore greatly eroded multilateral cooperation for development. The concept of development as a special part of a multilateral support system has been largely replaced by the laissez-faire approach to the globalized economy. This has resulted, inter alia, in sharply contracted financial resources for development for the majority of the developing countries, particularly the least developed countries. External indebtedness has escalated, and protectionism in international trade has risen significantly as more and more countries have become inward-looking in this era of globalization. This dire situation will certainly impact on the implementation of the commitments agreed upon at the recent major global conferences, including in the fields of environment and development, social development, population and development, women and development, habitat and food. It is therefore a matter of great concern to all of us that the achievement of sustainable human development will be further removed from reality. I believe that our troubles are less the result of the vagaries of globalization than the consequence of an economic doctrine that has dominated international economic relations for many years now. This doctrine presents unbridled liberalization as a panacea for all economies, developed and developing. In their desire to integrate themselves with the global economy, many developing countries have audaciously opened up their economies, only to realize that the social and political costs of doing so often outstrip the benefits. Moreover, the inordinate emphasis on unfettered markets has led to the neglect of such development issues as international cooperation for development, the need for non-commercial financial flows and the necessity of differential treatment for developing countries. Thus, the international agenda has been governed by the interests of the developed countries in opening up opportunities for foreign investments, private capital flows â€” that often turn out to be merely speculative â€” and the export of their manufactures. In the face of such stark global realities, we must intensify international solidarity and cooperation. The international community should strengthen its management role in the world economy, in particular in the monetary and financial fields, including the establishment of surveillance and regulatory frameworks for short-term capital flows and trade in currencies, without constraining the liberalization of economies. This strengthened international management role is essential if we seek to avert future crises, alleviate the adverse impact of globalization and maximize its benefits. We should therefore seriously consider various initiatives for enhancing global financial and monetary cooperation. The proposed United Nations conference on financing for development would provide an opportunity to explore various options towards financial stability and development. It is also encouraging that the two-day high- level dialogue of the General Assembly last week contributed to increased awareness and understanding of the economic and social impact of globalization and the need for international cooperation in addressing that issue. Another important proposal is the one made by the Non-Aligned Movement for an international conference on money and finance for development in order to pursue comprehensive reform of the existing international monetary and financial system. Because we want the North-South dialogue to proceed in earnest, we should broaden and intensify South-South cooperation. Decades of development efforts have greatly increased the economic complementarities among developing countries. We must tap these complementarities and strengthen partnership in the South. In this effort, our developed-country partners and international institutions can play a valuable role by participating in tripartite arrangements. In this regard, a number of steps to promote South-South cooperation have been initiated, including a high-level meeting on regional and subregional cooperation, which will be held in Bali, Indonesia, this coming December. The commemoration of the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action on South-South cooperation will be held at a special one-day meeting in the General Assembly. Of great importance is the Group of 77 initiative on a South summit to be held prior to the Millennium Assembly, in the year 2000. This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was proclaimed as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations. To us in Indonesia who are now in the midst of formulating and initiating far-reaching 25 economic, social and political reforms, this is a particularly significant occasion. In fact, in line with our commitment to the Vienna Declaration, we have just launched a National Plan of Action on Human Rights aimed at infusing the various segments of society and of the Government, including the national security apparatus, with values conducive to the promotion and protection of human rights. We expect to sign and ratify in the near future several more United Nations conventions on human rights. The reform-development Government that is now in place in Indonesia will carry out vigorous measures to further democratize our national life. For we know very well that our economic recovery will basically have to be driven by confidence, on the part of the international community as well as on the part of our own citizens, in our own system of governance. In the face of the challenges of our time, we in Indonesia will rebuild and refine the institutions that will make the laws of economics work for our society. At the international level, I believe that it is also necessary to build and refine the institutions that will make global economics work for all nations, whether developed or developing. Globalization is not the demon that has been menacing our prospects for the future. But for too long we have accepted doctrines formulated and waved in the name of liberalization. The most perceptive economists of our day have been pointing out that error, and we must now heed them. Globalization and liberalization never required us to merely compete in dancing to the tune of the market place. It never told us to stop cooperating with one another. But many of us were enchanted with the gospel of unfettered laissez-faire until it was seen that the contagion of a financial crisis in one developing country in one corner of the globe could plunge the entire world into depression. Now it is clear â€” if it was not sufficiently clear before â€” that we are stewards of one anotherâs welfare, that we must extend a hand to every brother and sister who falters, or in the course of globalization none of us, developed or developing, will see salvation. Human destiny is indivisible. Let us never forget that again.  Let me take this opportunity to congratulate the President and his country, Uruguay, on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. I am convinced that his experience and skills will help the General Assembly fulfil its important tasks. I would also like to thank Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine for his work as President and to commend him on his decisive guidance during the deliberations of the fifty- second session of the General Assembly. The world order is being rearranged. Our time is marked by continuous change. It is of crucial importance that this process of change take place in a peaceful way and under the rules which the international community has agreed upon. The United Nations has an indispensable role in that regard and must be able to respond to the world?s needs. While it is true that the United Nations is a framework within which the Member States can pursue their own national interests, the United Nations is above all an instrument for making the common goals and aspirations of humankind a realistic programme for a better future. The world and its goals and challenges are changing, and the United Nations has to change as well. It was a wise decision for the Member States to support the Secretary- General?s programme for reform and help him undertake the necessary measures. We are glad to see that some of the steps of this excellent programme have already made the United Nations more responsive and more effective. Only an efficient universal organization can help us cope with the pressing challenges of globalization, economic and social development, environmental changes and the urgent need to protect and respect human rights. We need the United Nations to protect our highest and most basic goal: the maintenance of international peace and security. Therefore, we expect that the remaining proposals of the Secretary-General will be approved by the Members during this session of the General Assembly. This will allow us to move forward in the reform and transformation of our United Nations. Slovenia attaches special importance to the promotion of the noble principles and values upon which the United Nations is built. This is why we were especially proud to be elected a non-permanent member of the Security Council. The implementation of our key foreign-policy objectives, which we pursue in our work and endeavours in the Security Council, is, however, challenged by an increasing number of threats to peace and stability. Judgement, compassion and determination must guide us in our struggle to offer new hope for suffering people. From the Balkans to Central Africa and Central Asia, a particular type of warfare seems to be prevailing in all conflicts. The civilian population is the main — and, very often, also the only — target. Violations of human rights, international humanitarian law and the most horrible atrocities are becoming the usual consequences of these conflicts. These violations and their political root causes must be addressed by the international community from the very start. We must act with unity and determination to ensure that violations of humanitarian law and human rights do not remain unpunished. There are actors in the international community who still believe that the threat or use of force is a legitimate means of change. They consider political solutions and negotiations only after and if military options fail. We can see this in Africa, where new crises are succeeding the old ones. We can see it in the continued arms race, even in the nuclear field. We can also see it in Europe, with Kosovo offering yet another humanitarian tragedy. As if all of this were not enough, we also face the lowest, the most unjustified violence of all — international terrorism, which has harmed hundreds of innocent victims. 6 In Bosnia and Herzegovina the peace process is slowly but definitely extending its roots. However, this process has not yet become irreversible. The international community still has an important role in leading the post-conflict management of the situation. There is a growing need to ensure economic reconstruction and provide adequate economic aid. Slovenia is actively participating in those efforts. Many important issues in Bosnia and Herzegovina remain to be solved. The number of returning refugees, especially among minorities, has been substantially lower than expected. In this regard, we commend the role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, its Multinational Specialized Unit and the international police transition force for their role. Democratization and reconciliation are indispensable elements in consolidating peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Reconciliation, however, does not mean impunity. In fact, there will be no reconciliation until all war criminals are brought to justice. To this end, we expect the cooperation of all countries concerned. The situation in Kosovo has been giving rise to legitimate international concerns for quite some time now. Serious violations of human rights have been reported for years. In recent months the population of Kosovo has been subjected to a campaign of terror and forced to flee their homes and seek refuge in the woods and mountains. The international community should prevent humanitarian catastrophe this winter and force all the parties in the conflict to face their responsibilities. All forms of violence against the civilian population in Kosovo must stop. The Kosovo population needs a ceasefire and needs negotiations to start now. This is a prerequisite for the process of the return of refugees to start. The United Nations has the means to organize an effective international action for the maintenance of peace. The Security Council is addressing most of these problems. At the moment, Slovenia is proud to be a non-permanent member of the Security Council. We are doing our best to contribute to the common effort to ensure that peace is maintained, international obligations respected, justice done and innocent lives saved wherever and whenever possible. Slovenian armed forces already participate in actions to consolidate peace, security and stability. The conduct of peace-support operations is an expression of Slovenia?s political will and a reflection of the readiness of our armed forces. The wealth of experience the United Nations has accumulated is impressive. However, in many ways reform of its 50-year-old structure would greatly enhance its effectiveness. Slovenia shares the view of the majority of Member States that the Security Council also needs to be and should be reformed. It should become more representative and more up to date by expanding the number of its non-permanent as well as permanent members. It should become more effective in its decision- making. Last but not least, it should become more transparent, for its decisions affect all the Member States. This year?s session of the General Assembly will be marked significantly by the commemoration of an important event, which continues to be an important source of inspiration for United Nations activities today. Fifty years have passed since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a historic document that recognized the inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family as the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. This is an appropriate time to reflect on what has already been achieved and what still remains to be done in the field of human rights. This is the time to reconfirm our commitment and show our determination to promote and protect the whole spectrum of human rights — civil and political, as well as economic, social and cultural. We believe strongly that the promotion and protection of human rights is a legitimate concern of the international community and calls for a high level of international attention and cooperation. Slovenia strongly supports the work of the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda and is pleased to see the first ever verdict on the crime of genocide handed down by an international criminal court. We also see this as the most gratifying way to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The successful completion of the United Nations Diplomatic Conference on the establishment of an International Criminal Court on 17 July of this year is a historic step towards making the rule of law and human rights truly universal. We hope that this will help provide justice for victims, limit impunity and deter acts of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in the next century. 7 The signing of the Ottawa Convention was an important step forward towards the total ban of anti- personnel landmines. We all have to start a global process of demining and mine clearance operations in thousands of mined areas all over the world. At the same time, the process of the physical and mental rehabilitation of millions of mine victims throughout the world should start as soon as possible. Slovenia has already joined this process. The Government of the Republic of Slovenia established the International Trust Fund for Demining and Mine Victims Assistance in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The main purpose of the Fund is to raise financial resources and organize demining operations and a programme of rehabilitation for mine victims from Bosnia and Herzegovina. I would like to take this opportunity to invite other countries to join us in this noble effort. At the end of the cold war, many countries anticipated the end of the nuclear era. We were expecting an accelerated process of elimination of nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, and notwithstanding important successes in the reduction of nuclear arms, the proliferation of nuclear weapons has increased in recent years. Slovenia strongly deplores nuclear tests and appeals to all countries to end their military nuclear programmes. Slovenia demonstrated its determination to contribute to nuclear disarmament by joining seven other non-nuclear countries — Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, and Sweden — in launching the joint declaration of eight Ministers for Foreign Affairs entitled “Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: the need for a new agenda” [A/53/138]. The prime goal of our action was to start new efforts for nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. We, the representatives of eight countries, are firm in our efforts to enable forthcoming generations to enjoy a world free of nuclear weapons. This is the time for concrete action and visionary initiatives. The evolution of the international system requires both. Slovenia is aware of this important need. We believe that such basic issues of international security as the issue of nuclear arms need to be addressed in a realistic and comprehensive manner.  I am pleased, on behalf of my delegation, to extend to Mr. Opertti our warmest congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. Just three months ago, the Philippines commemorated the centennial of the birth of Asia’s first Republic. A month before that the Filipino people conducted the most sacred rite of a democracy: the election of national leaders by popular will. The successful electoral process resulted in the second peaceful transfer of power since our “people power” revolution of 1986. President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, with a resounding mandate from the Filipino people, has taken over the task of leading the Philippines into its second century as a free and democratic nation. But he does so at a very trying time; he must steer the ship of state on very turbulent waters, with global forecasts painting a picture of even more stormy weather ahead. And the Asian economic crisis rolls on; it is no longer just Asian nor entirely economic. It will wreak havoc anywhere and spare no one. It has already hit the Philippines hard, though perhaps not as badly as some other countries. Yet, for us, the only tenable direction to go is forward; to go back is to founder. Thus, the Estrada Administration’s economic policy will remain market- friendly, even as it is pro-poor and pro-business. The Philippines will keep the momentum of economic reform and strengthen in particular its financial and banking sectors. Like all other States, the Philippines pursues foreign policy to promote national security and development. But we view national security beyond the traditional concerns of sovereignty and territorial integrity. For in a global regime characterized by evolving multipolarity of political and military power and by growing economic and financial interdependence, with all their attendant opportunities and risks, my nation’s peace and prosperity increasingly depend on stability and growth abroad. As President Estrada has said, our way of life, our fundamental values and our institutions can flourish and find true expression only if we enjoy political stability, economic solidarity, sociocultural cohesion, moral consensus and ecological balance, at home as well as with our partners in the world. Our national security and development demand that we actively advance the internationally shared goals of freedom, openness, peace, prosperity and justice. It is in this context that the Philippines regards the United Nations, which it helped found 53 years ago, as a most important partner in our efforts to promote our own national security and development. Our part of the world, the Asia-Pacific region, is the scene of growing regional cooperation coexisting side by side with regional tensions. The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has not only increased its membership but has also expanded its work from the purely economic and social to the security and political fields. It took the lead in creating the ASEAN Regional Forum — the only regional security dialogue mechanism that brings together all the Powers with a stake in peace and stability in East Asia and the Western Pacific. The Philippines hosted the fifth ASEAN Regional Forum last July and is gratified with the growing trust and confidence among Forum participants and with the 6 progress in the promotion of greater transparency and mutual understanding in the region. Nevertheless, the Asia-Pacific region is not tension- free. Territorial disputes and issues left over from the Second World War fester. The Philippines hopes that as the new millennium dawns meaningful action towards the resolution of such issues will commence in earnest among the countries concerned. Peace in the Korean peninsula is essential. The Philippines supports ongoing efforts, including those of the Four-Party Talks and of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO), to build the foundations of peace in the Korean peninsula. Peace in the South China Sea is crucial to peace and prosperity in East Asia. The Philippines encourages all parties concerned to scrupulously observe the principles contained in the ASEAN Declaration on the South China Sea of 1992. The ratification of the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community augurs well for Africa. The efforts at conflict resolution and prevention by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and subregional organizations such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), deserve to be lauded. Nonetheless, one cannot escape the fact that the more intense of today’s conflicts have occurred in Africa. The tragic events in Rwanda, in Burundi, between Ethiopia and Eritrea, in Sierra Leone and now in the Congo are familiar to us all. Although these States are responsible for their future, the recurring and protracted conflicts in Africa demand a multilateral response to the political, economic and social ills of the region, and the need to address development issues is paramount. We also cannot afford to ignore the humanitarian disasters such as those in the Sudan. Indeed, political stability is required in Africa, but so is aid. Let no one in this Hall forget Africa and our collective duty to alleviate human suffering there. The Philippines firmly hopes that the Middle East peace process will resume in earnest and encompass all relevant parties. We reaffirm the need to achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East. The growing number of signatures to and ratifications of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) raised hopes that nuclear weapons were becoming obsolete. Unfortunately, the nuclear- weapon States have yet to live up to their NPT commitments. Moreover, the recent nuclear tests in South Asia were a destabilizing development. The proliferation of missile technology and capability is just as fraught with danger, if not more dangerous, than the spread of nuclear weapons. These two make for a deadly combination for everyone; both must be stopped. So, too, must the continuing development and stockpiling of other weapons of mass destruction cease. Likewise, we need to put an end to the unregulated transfer and indiscriminate and often illegal circulation of small arms and light weapons. The Philippines is also deeply committed to the banning and destruction of anti-personnel landmines. My Government is deeply gratified that our common intense effort to conclude the Convention on anti-personnel mines succeeded last December. We strongly urge States that have not yet done so to sign the Convention. We urge all to assist in landmine clearance and the rehabilitation of landmine victims. Political instability and the collapse of peace and order in any State produce deleterious effects, including security threats for others. For this reason, the Philippines contributes where it can to the establishment or restoration of political stability in other lands, particularly in support of democracy. Cambodia’s recently held elections have been judged free and fair. But, as recent developments in that country show, democratic elections, while necessary, are not a sufficient condition for democracy or for peace and stability. Cooperation by all Cambodian parties, prompted by a deeper love for the nation’s good, is required. The efforts of the ASEAN troika, the Friends of Cambodia and the United Nations have not been in vain; they have just not been enough. Much could be done by the international community; but so much more needs to be done by the Cambodians themselves to pull their country back from the brink. The Philippines hopes to see a fully stable South- East Asia, where all peoples enjoy peace and national reconciliation. We hope to see all 10 countries in the region working together for a united and outward-looking South-East Asia, bonded in a partnership of dynamic development and in a community of caring societies. Thus, we are committed to assisting Myanmar and Laos 7 in their integration into a peaceful, prosperous, humane and just ASEAN. Peace and order are threatened by the evils of terrorism and transnational crime. Terrorism is a crime against humanity, and we strongly condemn it. Transnational crime in all its guises, including drug- trafficking, trafficking in women and children, and money- laundering, must be stopped. The Philippines joins the rest of the international community in hailing the adoption of the Rome statute of the International Criminal Court. I wish to convey my Government’s serious intention to consider the matter of accession to that treaty in the near future. The world needs economic solidarity. And the Asian crisis, which has spread to other regions, is our immediate global concern. For in its wake, millions of lives have been afflicted, with untold suffering. In its path, nations may fall. The Bretton Woods institutions have played a vital role in the global economy. But it is now clear that their methods and their resources, particularly those of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), are sorely insufficient to contain the crisis and to restore the health of afflicted economies. We need to replenish IMF resources, augment the funds of the World Bank and the regional banks, and develop new remedies for the new problems of a globalized economy. The United Nations can play a significant role in fostering international cooperation and action to solve the global crisis and mitigate its effects. Together, we can fight protectionism. The suffering spawned by the crisis must be addressed. The significant decline in official development assistance from donor countries needs to be reversed. Now more than ever, social amelioration programmes and safety nets must be enhanced. The crisis has forced us, too, to focus attention on the quality of governance. The issues of corruption and cronyism have been catapulted to the top of national debates. The ensuing convergence of ideas and resolve towards greater transparency and a more level playing field, at home and throughout the world, should be boons to our peoples and nations. The financial crisis has also confronted us with the reality that the world is dealing with a new phenomenon. This is the phenomenon of massive amounts of capital flowing across national borders at lightning speed, bloating economies into fragile bubbles as they rush in and shaking economies to their foundations as they are withdrawn. This is one aspect of globalization that carries great peril. It requires much diligent study and delicate handling. We have long recognized the need to recast the global trading regime and make it more responsive to the requirements of our time. Our efforts on this are well advanced. Now we must begin the work on the global financial system. Together, we must plan and build a new architecture that best suits today’s and tomorrow’s needs. The Philippines welcomes President Clinton’s eight- point agenda to lead the world out of the current global economic and financial instability. Real action is what the world, not just Asia, needs urgently. Indeed, threatening clouds are overhead. Lives are needlessly shattered. We need to limit the damage now and start rebuilding as soon as we can. Another lesson the crisis teaches us is about how brittle and fleeting high growth in gross domestic product is. It is not difficult to associate the roots of civil unrest in the wake of economic hardships with the lack of social justice on the ground. The poor, who get hit first and hardest in any economic downturn, will always be restive if development yields dividends only for the rich. The crisis makes us realize that the fruits of prosperity and the pains of sacrifice must be enjoyed or borne equitably. The globalization of information and the media may have reduced cultural barriers to the point of homogenizing certain cultural aspects of life. But the world continues to suffer from cultural intolerance. The plight of children, the rights and advancement of women and human rights in general still need to be addressed vigorously by the international community. The continuing exploitation of children for pornography, prostitution and drug-trafficking, not to mention the suffering of displaced and refugee children, is a global problem. The Convention on the Rights of the Child should guide international action in this area. At the regional level, the Philippines and the United Kingdom, under the aegis of the Asia-Europe Meeting, have launched a joint initiative on child welfare with a view to creating a better international cooperation mechanism on this endeavour. The Philippines attaches great importance to the promotion and protection of the rights of migrant workers and their families, and we continue to call upon all countries to accede to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. All human rights — political, civil, social and economic — are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 8 interrelated. So long as any or all of these rights are not respected globally, we cannot rest, even as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For the Philippines, the best and surest way to promote social justice and human rights is through a sincere commitment to the rule of law. And one law that is self- evident and immutable in all cultures is the sanctity of human life and the dignity of the human person. Many of the international commitments made at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, particularly Agenda 21, remain unfulfilled. And sadly, no new or additional resources needed by developing countries to implement many of the actions agreed at the Summit have materialized. We appeal for early action on these points. Sustainable development continues to be an important focus of Philippine foreign policy. As Chair of the sixth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development, the Philippines emphasized the role of civil society in the implementation of cooperative activities in key areas such as freshwater resources, the role of industry, technology transfer and capacity-building in development. Last April, the Philippines signed the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We join other States parties to the Convention in urging the speedy entry into force of that Protocol. Addressing global challenges and problems requires international action and cooperation. The United Nations remains the principal multilateral forum for the initiation of such action and cooperation. As a founding member, the Philippines recognizes that the United Nations must have the active support of all its Members and adequate resources in order to be effective. We have supported the various reform exercises undertaken in the past years, and we will continue to do so, to ensure the continued relevance of this our reliable partner. Inasmuch as the overwhelming majority of United Nations members are from the developing world, the United Nations reform process must restore development issues to the core of the United Nations agenda. It should also enable the General Assembly to fulfil effectively its Charter- mandated responsibilities. There is a pressing need to modernize and reform the Security Council. The Council is the United Nations organ with the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security, and its decisions must be viewed as serving the collective interest of all United Nations Members. Thus, its membership must be enlarged to include more key global players and developing countries. Its working methods and decision-making processes should become more transparent and democratic. As a democracy, the Philippines is convinced that global efforts and cooperation to achieve peace, prosperity and development can succeed only if democracy thrives within nations and serves as the basis for relations between and among them. At the global level, this requires respect for the principle of sovereign equality among States, the commitment to enrich, not beggar, one another, the need to uphold and defend the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law, the pacific settlement of disputes, the promotion of all human rights, and respect for the one and only world we live in. Without exception, all nations need to cooperate and be part of the solution to all the world’s woes. For we are all in this together, and there are no others to blame. As Shakespeare admonished, “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings“ (Julius Caesar, Act I, scene 2). Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on behalf of the Government of Chile and in my personal capacity, on your election as President of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly, which represents a deserved tribute to your political skills and diplomatic career, as well as a recognition of your country?s commitment to the work of the United Nations. It gives us very special pleasure because you are a national of Uruguay, a Latin American country that is especially close to Chile, and with which, in addition, we are cooperating closely in the Rio Group and the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR). We also congratulate the Secretary-General on the leadership he has demonstrated since he took up his duties. His vision of the necessary reform of this Organization, as well as his dedication to the solution of important international problems, gives us great satisfaction. We encourage him to persevere in pursuit of the goals he has set himself. Globalization, interdependence and regional integration are phenomena that characterize present-day international realities. The experience of many countries, Chile among them, shows that greater participation in the world economy, if appropriately channelled, can constitute a key element in the economic growth and prosperity of countries. Nevertheless, these phenomena, whose logic and dynamics are universal in scope, still offer ambivalent and contradictory lessons and meanings, depending on their magnitude and the effects they are causing in the different parts of the world. It is obvious that this process gives rise to legitimate uncertainties and concern in the context of the financial upheavals that, having started in the Asia/Pacific region, now affect the whole world. The need for more effective and concerted action by the main international economic Powers and the specialized 22 agencies to deal with these situations is becoming increasingly apparent. The need to reshape the global financial architecture is becoming ever more obvious. It seems clear that there is a need for greater coordination regarding the international community?s institutional capabilities to deal with situations like the present one. The world has experienced similar situations before, but they now take place in a context of much greater interdependence. This necessitates an in-depth review of the current structures of the world financial system in order to adapt them to the new challenges of internationalization. Otherwise, we shall always be vulnerable to upheavals like the present ones, and to setbacks in those parts of the world that are affected. Obviously, no agency of the multilateral system, on its own and using only its own methods, is in a position to bring certainty and stability to the current crisis. In the search for solutions, we need to combine different approaches and concerns: financial order, growth of international trade, effective social security networks, promotion of investment and growth, and respect for workers, among others. We have a great opportunity to grasp fully the integrated nature of these problems and define genuinely coordinated policies in order to solve them. This is a task in which the entire international community must participate. The Latin American countries have assumed their responsibilities for building sound economies with increasingly low levels of inflation, progressively decreasing their budget deficits and reducing unemployment and indebtedness. What Chile has done in this respect is recognized, and has been frequently praised in recent years. In little over a decade, Chile has doubled the size of its economy. This year, 1998, will be our twelfth year of uninterrupted growth. For eight years we have been constantly reducing inflation and unemployment, with a financial surplus and high domestic and external savings rates. All of this has taken place in a context of great openness to the outside world and a regional integration process conducted with a view to promoting open regionalism. It has also taken place in the context of an increasing expansion of social investment, whose benefits for the most vulnerable sectors of the population are apparent in the high indicators achieved by Chile in this Organization?s latest Human Development Report. However, despite these significant achievements we have also had to face in recent months problems that we share with many countries in our region, stemming from the global financial crisis and the difficulties created in some of our main export markets. President Frei's Government has adopted stringent adjustment measures in order to reduce public and private expenditure, avoid an upsurge of inflation, and, at the same time, maintain social investment and protect Chileans? jobs. This permits us — as the Heads of State and Government of our region did when they met on 5 September at the Twelfth Rio Group Summit — to call on all to discharge their responsibilities in this respect, as we have discharged our own. Our Presidents are concerned about the possibility that the crisis will become more acute, and accordingly they urge the countries in which it arose to take the necessary measures to correct their imbalances; the countries of the Group of Seven to take action to restore the stability of financial markets and ensure the growth of the world economy; and the international financial institutions to involve themselves more rapidly and effectively in resolving the crisis. There is also a need to prevent a mishandling of the crisis or half-way measures leading to the reproduction or even accentuation of the inequities that characterize the current international system, which not only postpone access to progress and encourage despair, but also pose a serious and constant threat to international peace and security. The emergence of a new worldwide awareness, the enlargement of the international agenda and the need to deal collectively with the problems of interdependence provide an impetus for the adoption of new international regimes. Examples of the progress achieved in cooperative multilateralism include the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Antarctic Treaty, international humanitarian law, the Uruguay Round agreements that led to the creation of the World Trade Organization and the set of regimes relating to arms control and disarmament in general. Human rights have ceased to be an issue reserved exclusively for the sovereignty of countries, and have become a universal concern that no Government can ignore. Protection of the environment has an undoubtedly international dimension, in that issues as vital to our future as climate change, pollution and over-exploitation of the seas, depletion of the ozone layer and the advance of desertification all call for global treatment. The promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms constitute an inescapable 23 responsibility of the United Nations. The fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the fifth anniversary of the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna, constitute opportunities to renew our concern for and commitment to the values and principles embodied in the Declaration and the agreements adopted at the Conference. For Chile, the universality of human rights means assuming the intrinsic dignity of all inhabitants of the planet, regardless of their culture, religion, social status, ethnic origin, gender or traditions. Neither lack of development nor cultural characteristics can be invoked to justify limiting the human rights recognized in a Declaration to which we have all subscribed. In this context, the recently approved International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its Follow-up is an important step forward in strengthening the basic rights of workers throughout the world. This new international regime must be promoted by the entire multilateral system. A few days ago, I had the great honour of signing in Rome, on behalf of my Government, the Statute of the International Criminal Court. Chile has committed itself to participate actively in the launching of the Court. This institution has been a long-standing aspiration, and many recent events have made it essential. It will contribute to the strengthening of the international human rights regime, the progressive development of international humanitarian law, the prevention of mass violations and the fight against impunity in cases of genocide or crimes against humanity. The subject of disarmament also continues to be one of the most vital issues on the international agenda. Recent events in this field, such as the nuclear tests carried out in South Asia, which my Government deeply deplores, highlight the urgent need to enhance the validity and universal application of instruments such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). We must take responsibility for the danger of nuclear proliferation and urge the parties concerned not to repeat such actions, and we must renew our calls on all States to sign and ratify the international instruments designed to eliminate the nuclear threat. Accordingly, we welcome Brazil?s recent accession to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. We must also make efforts to develop and improve our instruments for regulating the manufacture, trade and use of conventional weapons. In this context, we are extremely pleased to know that the Treaty on the elimination of anti-personnel landmines has entered into force with the completion of the first 40 ratifications. Chile hopes to complete its process of legislative approval shortly in order to be able to ratify this important instrument. For these same reasons, we adopted this morning, together with other countries, a declaration supporting the ad hoc group in its work to strengthen the verification and monitoring mechanisms of the Biological Weapons Convention. Chile strongly favours the process of establishing new international regimes, whether regional or global, to confront these and other challenges. The United Nations plays a vital role in this field. The campaign against drug-trafficking and other forms of organized crime can be truly effective only when it takes place in a context of strong and genuine regional and worldwide cooperation. Chile supports the implementation of the decisions adopted at the twentieth special session of the General Assembly, on the world drug problem, decisions which can serve as a basis for a common regulatory system and effective multilateral cooperation. The fight against international terrorism, which has perpetrated such reprehensible acts this year, also requires a much more effective international cooperation. Such dramatic issues as the treatment of refugees and combating hunger fall fully within the scope of multilateral activity. My country attaches great importance to this function of our Organization. We believe that it must continue to be expanded and intensified in the years to come. Of course, Chile is fully prepared to continue participating in this task. In the context of our participation in the United Nations, I wish to express my gratitude to the Member States, as well as to the employers? and workers? groups of the International Labour Organization (ILO), for the singular confidence placed in Chile and its Ambassador to the United Nations, Mr. Juan Somav'a, by electing him Director-General of the ILO, beginning in March 1999. My Government wishes to express its profound satisfaction at having been a part of the Security Council during the biennium 1996-1997. In the exercise of the responsibility entrusted to us by the international community, my Government sought in every action it took to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security and to fully assume the humanitarian 24 responsibility placed upon the Security Council in its activities. We have always believed that this responsibility should be manifested in the protection of the humanitarian workers in conflict zones, in the ongoing presence of the United Nations and its specialized agencies subsequent to the ending of hostilities so as to build peace effectively and in the focused application of sanctions that are adopted so that they will not affect innocent civilians. Chile is convinced that the United Nations peacekeeping forces can be identified as the Organization?s most effective mechanism for preventing and resolving international conflicts. We are aware that peacekeeping operations designed to take action in crises and conflicts between States have been faced with major challenges during the present decade. Nevertheless, for all the well- known limitations, the experience built up over the past three years can be regarded as promising for the future. Many more human lives could be saved through United Nations peacekeeping operations, were we able to strengthen them effectively. My Government wishes to express its firm resolve to continue cooperating, actively and frequently, in the activities of this important instrument of the Organization. Three years ago, when we celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, Member States assumed a commitment to unite our efforts to reform and democratize the structures of the Organization, with a view to the new and complex challenges we shall have to face in an increasingly changing international scene. This session of the General Assembly has the task of taking up important pending aspects of that reform. The adoption of resolution 52/12 constitutes an important first step down the long road to reform. We are also encouraged by the changes that are being introduced in the Economic and Social Council. The introduction of new methods and programmes and the incorporation into its agenda of a segment on humanitarian affairs will contribute to its renewal. The summits and conferences on economic and social issues that have been held within the framework of the United Nations during the 1990s have reaffirmed our Organization?s priority commitment to development. Likewise, those events have provided conceptual tools and ideas that are of great value for drawing up public policies for achieving economically, socially and environmentally sustainable development. The eradication of poverty must continue to be a central objective. The same is true of the promotion of human rights, gender equality and protection of the environment. It is essential that the General Assembly conduct periodic reviews of the commitments made on these issues at the summit meetings and conferences, as is to happen in the case of the International Conference on Population and Development, which is to be reviewed next June, and the Fourth World Conference on Women, the review of which will take place in the year 2000. We also attach special importance to the special session of the General Assembly to be convened in the year 2000 for the purpose of reviewing compliance with the commitments of the Social Summit. Chile has had the honour of presiding over the preparatory committee for that special session. It is our hope that that meeting will be able to conclude with the adoption of new initiatives at the national and international level that will allow further progress to be made in the process of implementing the agreements reached at the Summit. The process of reforming and democratizing the Security Council is one of the most important of the many objectives we have set ourselves in the context of the process of renewing the United Nations. The Council must reflect the new international realities. It needs to be enlarged to remedy, among other things, the unjustified under-representation of the developing countries in that body. Nevertheless, the arduous process of reform in which we are engaged calls for broad-based majority support. It will be possible only with solid and substantive consensus. Frankly, we would prefer to sacrifice some of the urgency of such reforms rather than participate in a decision-making process which, lacking the support of the vast majority of members, could give rise to serious divisions between us. Furthermore, my Government believes that enlargement of the Council, important though it may be from the standpoint of enhancing its representativeness and legitimacy, is not of itself sufficient to endow the Council with the qualities required by its role as the guarantor of international peace and security. At the same time, measures must be adopted with regard to its working methods, particularly in relation to transparency, with which every one of its actions should be imbued and which should not be challenged. 25 We must stress the negative impact of the veto mechanism, which should be regulated and progressively reduced with a view to its gradual elimination in the long term. A first step in this direction might be to amend the Charter so that the right of veto can be applied only to actions taken by the Council under Chapter VII. I should like to conclude by expressing our optimism with regard to the future of the Organization. I hope that the Millennium Assembly, to which we have lent our full support, will be the expression of a renewed and much stronger United Nations as we enter the new century.  Let me begin by thanking the Assembly for its very kind and generous welcome and by noting that, at the opening of this fifty-third session of the General Assembly, the world has much to celebrate. Peace has come to Northern Ireland after 29 long years. Bosnia has just held its freest elections ever. The United Nations is actively mediating crises before they explode into war, all around the world. And today more people determine their own destiny than at any previous moment in history. We celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with those rights more widely embraced than ever before. On every continent people are leading lives of integrity and self-respect, and a great deal of the credit for that belongs to the United Nations. Still, as every person in this Hall knows, the promise of our time is attended by perils. Global economic turmoil today threatens to undermine confidence in free markets and democracy. Those of us who benefit particularly from this economy have a special responsibility to do more to minimize the turmoil and extend the benefits of global markets to all citizens. And the United States is determined to do that. We still are bedevilled by ethnic, racial, religious and tribal hatreds, by the spread of weapons of mass destruction, by the almost frantic efforts of too many States to acquire such weapons. And, despite all efforts to contain it, terrorism is not fading away with the end of the twentieth century. It is a continuing defiance of article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which says 9 “Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.” Here at the United Nations, at international summits around the world and on many occasions in the United States, I have had the opportunity to address this subject in detail, to describe what we have done, what we are doing and what we must yet do to combat terror. Today I would like to talk to the Assembly about why all nations must put the fight against terrorism at the top of our agenda. Obviously this is a matter of profound concern to us. In the last 15 years our citizens have been targeted over and over again: in Beirut; over Lockerbie; in Saudi Arabia; at home in Oklahoma City by one of our own citizens; even here in New York, in one of our most public buildings; and most recently, on 7 August, in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, where Americans who devoted their lives to building bridges between nations — people very much like all of those present — died in a campaign of hatred against the United States. Because we are blessed to be a wealthy nation, with a powerful military and a worldwide presence active in promoting peace and security, we are often a target. We love our country for its dedication to political and religious freedom, to economic opportunity, to respect for the rights of the individual. But we know that many people see us as a symbol of a system and values they reject. And often they find it expedient to blame us for problems with deep roots elsewhere. But we are no threat to any peaceful nation, and we believe the best way to disprove these claims is to continue our work for peace and prosperity around the world. For us to pull back from the world’s trouble spots, to turn our backs on those taking risks for peace, to weaken our own opposition to terrorism, would hand the enemies of peace a victory they must never have. Still, it is a grave misconception to see terrorism as only, or even mostly, an American problem. Indeed, it is a clear and present danger to tolerant and open societies and innocent people everywhere. No one in this room, nor the people represented here, is immune. Certainly not the people of Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. For every American killed there, roughly 20 Africans were murdered and 500 more injured — innocent people going about their business on a busy morning. Not the people of Omagh, in Northern Ireland, where the wounded and killed were Catholics and Protestants alike — mostly children and women, two of them pregnant — people out shopping together when their future was snuffed out by a fringe group clinging to the past. Not the people of Japan, who were poisoned by sarin gas in the Tokyo subway. Not the people of Argentina, who died when a car bomb destroyed a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires. Not the people of Kashmir and Sri Lanka, killed by ancient animosities that cry out for resolution. Not the Palestinians and Israelis, who still die year after year, for all their progress towards peace. Not the people of Algeria, enduring a nightmare of unfathomable terror with still no end in sight. Not the people of Egypt, who nearly lost a second President to assassination. Not the people of Turkey, Colombia, Albania, Russia, Iran, Indonesia and countless other nations where innocent people have been victimized by terror. None of those victims were American. But every one was a son or daughter, a husband or wife, a father or mother — a human life extinguished by someone else’s hatred, leaving a circle of people whose lives will never be the same. Terror has become the world’s problem. Some argue, of course, that the problem is overblown, saying that the number of deaths from terrorism is comparatively small, sometimes less than the number of people killed by lightning in a single year. I believe that misses the point in several ways. First, terrorism has a new face in the 1990s. Today, terrorists take advantage of greater openness and the explosion of information and weapons technology. The new technologies of terror and their increasing availability, along with the increasing mobility of terrorists, raise chilling prospects of vulnerability to chemical, biological and other kinds of attacks, bringing each of us into the category of possible victim. This is a threat to all humankind. Beyond the physical damage of each attack, there is an even greater residue of psychological damage, hard to measure but slow to heal. Every bomb, every bomb 10 threat, has an insidious effect on free and open institutions; the kinds of institutions everyone in this body is working so hard to build. Each time an innocent man or woman or child is killed, it makes the future more hazardous for the rest of us, for each violent act saps the confidence that is so crucial to peace and prosperity. In every corner of the world, with the active support of United Nations agencies, people are struggling to build better futures based on bonds of trust connecting them with their fellow citizens and with partners and investors from around the world. The glimpse of growing prosperity in Northern Ireland was a crucial factor in the Good Friday Agreement. But that took confidence, confidence that cannot be bought in times of violence. We can measure each attack in the grisly statistics of dead and wounded. But what are the wounds we cannot measure? In the Middle East, in Asia, in South America — how many agreements have been thwarted after bombs blew up? How many businesses will never be created in places crying out for investments of time and money? How many talented young people in countries represented here have turned their backs on public service? The question is not only how many lives have been lost in each attack, but how many futures were lost in their aftermath. There is no justification for killing innocents. Ideology, religion and politics, even deprivation and righteous grievance, do not justify it. We must seek to understand the roiled waters in which terror occurs. Of course we must. Often in my own experience I have seen that where peace is making progress, terror is a desperate act to turn back the tide of history. The Omagh bombing came as peace was succeeding in Northern Ireland. In the Middle East, whenever we get close to another step towards peace, its enemies respond with terror. We must not let this stall our momentum. The bridging of ancient hatreds is, after all, a leap of faith — a break with the past — and thus a frightening threat to those who cannot let go of their own hatred. Because they fear the future, in these cases terrorists seek to blow the peacemakers back into the past. We must also acknowledge that there are economic sources of this rage as well. Poverty, inequality and masses of disenfranchised young people are fertile fields for the siren call of the terrorists and their claims of advancing social justice. But deprivation cannot justify destruction; nor can inequity ever atone for murder. The killing of innocents is not a social programme. Nevertheless, our resolute opposition to terrorism does not mean we can ever be indifferent to the conditions that foster it. The most recent United Nations Human Development Report suggests the gulf is widening between the world’s haves and have-nots. We must work harder to treat the sources of despair before they turn into the poison of hatred. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once wrote that the only revolutionary is a man who has nothing to lose. We must show people they have everything to gain by embracing cooperation and renouncing violence. This is not simply an American or a Western responsibility; it is the world’s responsibility. Developing nations have an obligation to spread new wealth fairly, to create new opportunities, to build new, open economies. Developed nations have an obligation to help developing nations stay on the path of prosperity and to spur global economic growth. A week ago I outlined ways we can build a stronger international economy to benefit not only all nations, but all citizens within them. Some believe that terrorism’s principal fault line centres on what they see as an inevitable clash of civilizations. This is an issue that deserves a lot of debate in this great Hall. Specifically, many believe there is an inevitable clash between Western civilization and values and Islamic civilization and values. I believe this view is terribly wrong. False prophets may use and abuse any religion to justify whatever political objectives they have — even cold-blooded murder. Some may have the world believe that Almighty God Himself, the merciful, grants a licence to kill; but that is not our understanding of Islam. A quarter of the world’s population is Muslim, from Africa to the Middle East to Asia and to the United States, where Islam is one of our fastest growing faiths. There are over 1,200 mosques and Islamic centres in the United States, and that number is rapidly increasing. The 6 million Americans who worship there will tell you there is no inherent clash between Islam and America. Americans respect and honour Islam. As I talk to Muslim leaders in my country and around the world, I see again that we share the same hopes and aspirations: to live in peace and security, to provide for our children, to follow the faith of our choosing, to build a better life than our parents knew and to pass on brighter possibilities to our children. Of course, we are not identical. There are important differences that cross race and culture and religion which demand understanding and deserve respect. But every 11 river has a crossing place. Even as we struggle here in America, like the United Nations, to reconcile all Americans to each other and to find greater unity in our increasing diversity, we will remain on a course of friendship with and respect for the Muslim world. We will continue to look for common values, common interests and common endeavours. I agree very much with the spirit expressed by these words of Mohammed: “Rewards for prayers by people assembled together are twice those for prayers said at home.” When it comes to terrorism, there should be no dividing line between Muslims and Jews, Protestants and Catholics, Serbs and Albanians, developed societies and emerging countries. The only dividing line is between those who practise, support or tolerate terror and those who understand that it is murder, plain and simple. If terrorism is at the top of the American agenda and should be at the top of the world’s agenda, what, then, are the concrete steps we can take together to protect our common destiny? What are our common obligations? At least, I believe, they are these: to give terrorists no support, no sanctuary, no financial assistance; to bring pressure on States that do; to act together to step up extradition and prosecution; to sign the global anti-terror conventions; to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention and enforce the Chemical Weapons Convention; to promote stronger domestic laws and control the manufacture and export of explosives; to raise international standards for airport security; to combat the conditions that spread violence and despair. We are working to do our part. Our intelligence and law enforcement communities are tracking terrorist networks in cooperation with other Governments. Some of those we believe responsible for the recent bombing of our embassies have been brought to justice. Early this week I will ask our Congress to provide emergency funding to repair our embassies, to improve security, to expand the worldwide fight against terrorism and to help our friends in Kenya and Tanzania with the wounds they have suffered. But no matter how much each of us does alone, our progress will be limited without our common efforts. We will also do our part to address the sources of despair and alienation through the Agency for International Development in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America, in Eastern Europe, in Haiti and elsewhere. We will continue our strong support for the United Nations Development Programme, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Office of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the World Bank and the World Food Programme. We also recognize the critical role these agencies play and the importance of all countries, including the United States, in paying their fair share. In closing, let me urge all of us to think in new terms on terrorism, to see it not as a clash of cultures, or political action by other means, or a divine calling, but as a clash between the forces of the past and the forces of the future, between those who tear down and those who build up, between hope and fear, between chaos and community. The fight will not be easy. But every nation will be strengthened in joining it, in working to give real meaning to the words of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights we signed 50 years ago. It is very, very important that we do this together. Eleanor Roosevelt was one of the authors of the Universal Declaration. She said, in one of her many speeches in support of the United Nations when it was just beginning, “All agreements and all peace are built on confidence. You cannot have peace and you cannot get on with other people in the world unless you have confidence in them.” It is not necessary that we solve all the world’s problems to have confidence in one another. It is not necessary that we agree on all the world’s issues to have confidence in one another. It is not even necessary that we understand every single difference among us to have confidence in one another. But it is necessary that we affirm our belief in the primacy of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and therefore that together we say that terror is not a way to tomorrow. It is only a throwback to yesterday, and together, together we can meet it and overcome its threats, its injuries and its fears with confidence.  It is indeed my privilege, on behalf of the Government and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis, to have this opportunity once again to address the General Assembly. I feel especially pleased to participate this year, which coincides with the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, an instrument that has sought for the last 50 years to protect and advance the political, social and cultural human rights of peoples around the world. Throughout this half-century, the debate on human rights has focused critical attention on cultural, social and political rights. Regrettably, we have failed to develop an international agenda which includes economic rights as an integral part of fundamental human rights. Conceptually, political human rights, now a critical component of some foreign policy positions, have been fused imperceptibly with democracy, hence politics and human rights have become synonymous. I too am an advocate of human rights protection, and I believe strongly that if we insist on politics in human rights, the politics should be to enhance human dignity and the human condition by including all rights. The corpus of human rights demands innovative approaches whereby an individual?s human rights are not measured only by the freedom to vote but also by the right to self-development in a holistic sense. On the eve of the new millennium, I am still quite dissatisfied with the level of attention the world community is paying to the severe economic, environmental and potential political problems that threaten small island developing States. These problems are not new to this forum; they are well established and documented facts. Only last year, I spoke about the vulnerability of small island States and the need to establish practical, viable programmes to help us in our own development process. I lamented also last year the serious and ill-conceived notion of graduating small States like Saint Kitts and Nevis into artificial categories based on gross national product per capita. Today, I stand before the Assembly having witnessed firsthand the effects of hurricane Georges, which brought all sectors of the economy of Saint Kitts and Nevis to a standstill and increased the possibility of suffering. In a matter of a few hours, the growth and progress of the last few years have been literally wiped from the landscape of our lives. Large sectors of our rural communities in particular now appear to be reverting to a state of abject poverty. This is the stark reality — the reality of small island developing States. We have no tolerance for bureaucrats or financial houses telling us which levels of development are acceptable. Our reality after a hurricane is about people living without the basic necessities that we all take for granted. It is about families displaced, having to watch their dreams in ruins. It is about women and children made homeless. This is about real life, not just figures arbitrarily concocted for dubious purposes. It seems that we have become a community that relies heavily on figures. Therefore, let me share some of these figures here. Initial estimates of the damage and loss in productivity caused by only one hurricane have been placed at over $400 million, far exceeding the gross domestic product of Saint Kitts and Nevis. An estimated 85 per cent of the residential housing stock suffered slight to major damage; of that 85 per cent, approximately 25 per cent was destroyed. The agricultural sector, one of the major pillars on which the Saint Kitts and Nevis economy stands, has been devastated. Agricultural output — sugar and non-sugar alike — is expected to be reduced by as much as 50 per cent next year. The health sector and our ability to provide high- quality care have been seriously compromised. Not only did the smaller rural hospitals suffer damage to property and equipment, but also the Federation?s main hospital, the Joseph N. France General, lost a significant portion of its roof, and damage to equipment and stocks is considerable. The scene of devastation is equally mind-boggling and severe in other neighbouring islands, such as Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Antigua and Barbuda, Cuba and St. Maarten. The suffering in my country is therefore not unique. However, the fact that we suffer the same fate year after year and rebuild only to watch our progress washed and blown away so easily speaks to the need to look seriously at the vulnerability of small island States. 21 I make an urgent appeal for the international community to come to the aid of our countries and our peoples. A draft resolution will shortly be introduced to the Assembly on countries of the north-eastern Caribbean affected by this year?s storm, and I urge countries to support this effort by co-sponsoring the draft. Also, I wish to express the gratitude of my Government to those agencies, persons and Governments which have responded so readily in lending assistance. I would hasten to add that the task of rebuilding will not finish as soon as the eyes of the camera shift their focus, nor will normalcy in its true sense return in a matter of weeks. We need material, technical and financial support on an ongoing basis as we rebuild our country. I feel compelled to reiterate the problems of small States, especially in the light of continuous attempts to undermine our economies. My Government does not take lightly the complaints brought before the World Trade Organization, which are tantamount to the devastating hurricane winds on the small, vulnerable banana-producing economies in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States. I also fear that, as such initiatives continue, the sugar industry in my own country will suffer a similar fate. Our negligible exports, in percentage terms, cannot pose any credible threat to any transnational corporation or large producer of bananas and sugar. However, the removal of this fragile access, which we must fight to maintain, could wreak untold havoc in social and economic terms on the lives of so many poor families in the eastern Caribbean region. The insidious tentacles of injustice have such tremendous reach that international institutions such as the United Nations will be expected to devise ways to arrest its corrosive character by lending considerable support to the efforts of small island developing countries. I say all this against the backdrop that most decisively, the twentieth century has etched in our consciousness evidence of the power of the human mind in its infinite creativity and potential. Now we are able to cure illnesses once thought incurable, and we create technological feats that boggle the mind. I therefore salute the men and women who have made this century great. It becomes critically important, therefore, that as nations we utilize these landmark developments and shared experiences as the blueprints for the enormous challenges of poverty eradication, illicit drug trafficking, nuclear proliferation, warmongering, economic inequity, and disaster prevention and mitigation. Inasmuch as this century has brought exceptional technological advances, economic initiative and growth, the new millennium will demand greater moral strength and public leadership. It will require its leaders to develop similar courage and statesmanship against powerful challenges. It will dare us all to harness the moral energy to transcend partisan agendas in favour of a common global imperative. It is impractical to alienate an individual?s human rights from the right to development. These are inseparable and paramount. My Government regards the growth of human rights in its entirety as a genuine step towards strengthening democracy itself. In order for democracy to take root and the democratic process to develop in its sincerest sense, we must nurture the complete range of fundamental human rights. Then and only then will the human person flourish. When we hold ourselves up as standard bearers of democracy and bastions of human rights protection, it becomes essential to preserve human dignity worldwide. It has been said, “when the empire of man over nature can no longer be easily extended, then the only way for a people to increase its standard of living is by redistributing the sources or fruits of industry from others to themselves”. Any real hope for a more peaceful and equitable twenty-first century lies in the evolution of our thinking on human rights and other issues critical to small island States. One of the most crucial challenges in the coming century will be to address the quicksand of uneven economic development within the current economic system. These have direct consequences for the disparities in wealth and resource distribution. I raise the issue of vulnerability not to crave preferential treatment for our region, but because the international community must be mindful of our peculiar circumstances. It is being said that the structure and growth of the world investment climate are being shaped by current events such as the Asian crisis, the European monetary union, along with the creation of the euro, advances in technology, liberalization of national financial markets and their integration into a global market. Where does this situation leave small island developing States like Saint 22 Kitts and Nevis, especially when so many critical factors militate against our development priorities? Foreign direct investment is considered one of the main vehicles of the liberalization process. Small developing economies are being forced to liberalize and integrate into the centre of a global economic system which has always relegated us to the periphery. International capital is steadfastly in search of new markets, yet has continued to overlook our region. Consequently, the vast majority of the $4 trillion in foreign direct investment spent in 1997 bypassed our countries in the Caribbean region. At the centre of international integrated investment flows, “are large international and transnational corporations and their affiliates whose global sales volume was estimated to have reached some $7 trillion in 1995”. This poses the question of how our agri-based and export-oriented economies cope with or even attempt to compete against giant transnational institutions in an era in which international production has now become more important than exports in terms of the delivery of goods and services to foreign markets. Foreign direct investment, as I have come to understand it, integrates markets through intra-business activities and the production systems of countries. Therefore, our economies cannot participate in this huge and rapidly growing production system because we have not been given necessary technical, technological and material support to move into the centre of the global market place through its main vehicle — that is, production. To make matters worse, we have not been allowed opportunities to gain appropriate access to those critical markets, whereas foreign businesses based in those countries have the access and capability to dominate and flood our markets with their cheap products. One only needs to pay casual attention to the media to appreciate the tendency towards national and transnational mega-mergers and strategic economic business alliances that are taking place around the world. Our region is fast developing a competitive disadvantage. Earlier I spoke of injustice. I consider it an injustice when capital can be mobilized and deployed in such ways that could easily destroy the welfare of entire nations with impunity or stifle competition completely. Globalization has been touted as a great vehicle of opportunity and promise; but I ask, for whom? Globalization, it is said, offers a huge reservoir of resources for investment growth, economic equity and social advancement. However, in my region we are yet to see these promises. In the Caribbean, we are much more familiar with the risks of globalization. In anticipation of the changes taking place, our countries have made significant reforms. Regrettably, however, the international community, including prominent international financial institutions, has not always rallied in support of our efforts. Each year we build and we rebuild, but we are susceptible to external forces such as hurricanes. Our efforts, however, seem to go unnoticed. Today, the wide rift between expectation and achievements continues to grow. Saint Kitts and Nevis looks forward to the convening of a special session to review the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action, and the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action. We urge the United Nations and the international financial institutions to take a fresh look at ways to help small developing countries integrate into this emerging system. However, the rules of this system will have to be informed by the special situation of vulnerable small island States. We welcome initiatives on resource mobilization, on external debt relief, on trade and financing for development and on good governance of the international monetary and financial systems. Good governance should refer not only to developing countries; it ought to be extended to include better management of the international economic system. Failure to do so would lead only to instability, uncivil societies and an ungovernable global market place. The socio-economic and political dilemma facing small island developing States must be addressed now; otherwise, the human and political cost would be too high for us to bear. Many small nations pay our assessed contributions regularly to the United Nations system despite our meagre resources and the challenges to our national survival. We therefore expect more. We expect tangible benefits from our membership. It is incumbent on the United Nations to work with small island States to ensure that they reap the rewards of the changing political market economy. 23 In my address last June to the United Nations special session on drugs, I assured this community of my Government?s commitment to fighting the illicit drug trade. The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis remains resolute in its commitment to cooperate in the eradication of the narcotics trade and associated vices. This noble fight against a most nefarious and well- financed enemy carries a high financial cost. It is important to recognize that the role of consumption is just as important as that of supply. Therefore, we have a shared responsibility and must focus on joint approaches informed by cooperation and by mutual respect and understanding. Saint Kitts and Nevis remains undaunted and relentless in its approach to the interdiction of illicit drugs, as we work together with all nations in the name of justice, equity and advancing the human condition. In the spirit of advancing the human condition, my Government urges restraint, patience and dialogue on the critical issues that separate the Chinese people in both geographic and political terms. It is our sincerest hope that the common aspirations and expectations of the Chinese people will be fulfilled in the near future in an environment of peace and mutual respect. We believe that the family bonds and historical tradition that have made the Chinese people a great nation ought to be preserved. We believe that the time has come for the voice of the millions of Chinese people in the Republic of China on Taiwan to be heard and factored into the international agenda. We believe that adequate, urgent and practical mechanisms must be developed to allow them to participate in the work of all nations. In a world bedeviled by so many challenges, and in need of collective action and new resources, we alienate people and Governments at our own peril. We have an obligation to work with and encourage the Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to support the progress made to date, so that the advancement of the human condition transcends politics. I urge negotiation and the development of confidence-building measures as a way to move towards improving cross-Strait relations. We also call on the Government of Iraq to abide by all United Nations resolutions and to release all Kuwaiti prisoners of war and detainees, as well as those from other countries. In conclusion, as we continue this debate I trust that we will be able to move beyond the constraints of the developed/developing country paradigm of us against them. To advance the human condition for all humankind will require meaningful partnership. Instead of apportioning blame, I urge Member States to join with me as we rededicate our energies to the search for lasting solutions. By working together, it becomes easier to find ways of attaining our national aspirations without trampling on the legitimate dreams of others. Before starting my statement, I should like to express, on behalf of my delegation, our sympathy to the victims and their families in the path of the destructive Hurricane Georges through the countries of our region, including Caribbean sister nations. I call upon the United Nations and its humanitarian agencies to render all possible support to the countries and the peoples afflicted. Allow me to extend my congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election to preside over our General Assembly at this session. I would also like to express my appreciation to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for his important contribution during the last session. In addition, may I also thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his continuous efforts to transform our United Nations into a more effective instrument for promoting peace and enhancing the well-being of the people of the world as we move into a new millennium. The restructuring of the Security Council with a view to properly reflecting the present international economic and political reality and to meeting the new challenges of the next millennium is of fundamental importance. My delegation believes that the discussions should not be limited to the mere expansion of the Council, but should rather address the improvement of its effectiveness and its adherence to the principle of our Charter that all States are equal. We would like to emphasize that my delegation fully underscores the position taken by the Non-Aligned Movement, most recently at its twelfth summit meeting in Durban, South Africa. Suriname is pleased with the call by the Secretary- General for greater cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations in preventing conflicts. In the western hemisphere, it is mainly the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) which have often demonstrated their capabilities of overcoming seemingly insurmountable hurdles by preventing or ending conflicts between and within member States. Allow me to raise some matters of equally serious international concern that require urgent attention. A disturbing and despicable phenomenon, which we all must condemn in the strongest terms, is the senseless attacks on and even killing of international civil servants, including United Nations field officers. Since these heroic men and women are contributing to the cause of humanity, crimes committed against them must be treated as crimes against humanity and punished accordingly. Recent terrorist attacks in Africa, Europe and elsewhere have once more shocked the international community and have left us in a state of dismay. 5 The Republic of Suriname condemns international terrorism and welcomes the conclusion of regional agreements and mutually agreed declarations to combat and eliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. My Government deeply deplores the fact that the process for durable peace and reconciliation in the Middle East has again been stalled and the current situation continues the great suffering of the Palestinian people and uncertainty for the people of Israel. We call upon all sides to re-establish mutual confidence and call on the international community to exert every influence on the parties concerned to save the peace process. It is recognized that the phenomenon of globalization presents a challenge for the Caribbean region, and requires fundamental changes in our economies and in the developmental process of the region, while increasing the risk of marginalization for all vulnerable economies. In this regard, we share the view that the small Caribbean States should be granted a reasonable period for adjustment to the changing international environment, in order to enable us to improve our competitiveness, and a non-reciprocal preferential system must be maintained during that transition period. This will allow for a more realistic transition, which will eventually facilitate better adaptation of our economies. More than ever, the interdependence of States has become clear, now that the negative consequences of globalization have recently manifested themselves in a dramatic manner for many of our member States. I therefore make an urgent appeal to all responsible actors involved in the world economy, including the international financial institutions and monetary authorities, to adjust their relevant policies so as to redress the structural, financial and economic imbalances and adverse effects that have risen. We call upon all nuclear-weapon States to accede to and fully implement the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We are convinced that the new Department for Disarmament and Arms Regulation will bolster the capacity of the United Nations to pursue these objectives, bearing in mind the ruling by the International Court of Justice in July 1996 that the use of, or the threat to use, nuclear weapons is contrary to international humanitarian law. As we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Suriname wishes to reiterate its commitment to these rights. At the same time, my Government holds the view that it is equally important not to focus our attention solely on the fulfilment of civil and political rights; we should also focus on the fulfilment of the social and economic rights of our peoples. It is in this respect that Suriname believes that the implementation of the “Right of Development”, in particular for peoples in the developing world, must be given equal attention by the international community. What should be stressed in this context is that human rights and sustainable human development are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. The promotion of human rights is, indeed, of particular relevance in a globalized world, with its potential to marginalize the weak and small States, particularly those with limited resources. Suriname takes part in the General Assembly debate with a sense of pride, since it has demonstrated to the world its acceptance of responsibility for the protection of the environment by preserving one of the most pristine forests on this globe for conservation purposes. My country has recently created the Central Suriname Nature Reserve, comprising 1.6 million hectares and 12 per cent of the territory of the Republic of Suriname. This nature reserve, one of the largest nature reserves in South America and possibly the single most pristine tropical area on Earth, is our gift to humankind for eternity. I consider this gift a special contribution to, among other things, the safeguarding of one of the fundamental human rights of the world population, namely, the right to life. We hope that other nations will follow this example and commit themselves to the protection of the forests of our world. The information superhighway facilitates the exchange of information and can also contribute to the development and the promotion of public awareness worldwide. However, I must also express my sincere concern about the possible negative consequences of the misuse of this form of technology, which could have adverse effects on all strata of our communities, including our youth. It deserves serious consideration to develop and implement legislative measures to prevent any form of misuse of this form of technology, without in any respect jeopardizing the fundamental right of free expression. As a result of the twentieth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to the world drug problem, 6 Suriname is now in the final stage of organizing a subregional conference on the drug problem, the aim of which is to establish a plan of action in cooperation with Guyana, Venezuela, Brazil and France, in order to effectively combat this form of organized crime. Finally, I am pleased to conclude that since our last Assembly reform of our Organization has been well on its way, with a renewed emphasis on economic, social and development activities, and the need to implement its mission of peace, development and human rights in a more effective manner. We must continue to revitalize the United Nations, since it is our universal instrument for concerted action in the pursuit of our noble aim of the betterment of humankind. It bears repeating, again and again, that the majority of the key conflicts in the world, and the threats to the world community, can only be solved or averted through the strengthening of our multilateral mechanism. The United Nations must be that mechanism. Our combined political will should be its new life; a new life for the challenges of the new millennium.   On behalf of the Government and people of Antigua and Barbuda, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to preside over the General Assembly at this fifty-third session. You are well known to envoys from my country who have worked with you and who can attest to your humanistic and unprejudiced vision of the world. We feel confident that under your guidance this will be a productive session. I likewise wish to express my country’s recognition to your predecessor, Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for the skilful manner in which he conducted the work of the fifty-second session. I also pay tribute to the Secretary-General, who is entrusted with the advancement of this Organization at such a critical time in history. I am also grateful to the Secretariat for scheduling Antigua and Barbuda in this slot. This year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), of which Antigua and Barbuda is a proud member. Despite the utterances of the prophets of doom, CARICOM did much more than survive, and the areas of cooperation deepened and widened. What started as a free-trade arrangement has expanded, and is now marked by a number of significant institutions in areas such as education and health, as well as in sports and culture. This year the Order of the Caribbean Community award was given to four individuals, among them the former Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, the Right Honourable Vere Cornwall Bird, appropriately dubbed “The father of the Nation”. In accepting the award, the former Prime Minister stated: “despite the difficulties, we have erected fine institutions — institutions that are a tribute to the resourcefulness of our leaders and the support of the people. But, difficult as they were to build, it is easy for them to be tumbled unless today’s leaders and people are prepared to safeguard and preserve them. To do so requires the same vision, the same determination and the same spirit of selflessness that motivated the previous generation.” I assure you, Mr. President, that the spirit that he mentioned is steadfast among us, and that there is no turning back. Peace, security and disarmament are vital to a safe and secure planet, and the countless individuals who live daily in constant fear, whether in regard to terrorists, hatred between ethnic groups, internecine warfare or religious persecution, give us much concern. Added to that is the expanding nuclear rivalry. The nuclear club is no longer exclusive to the five permanent members of the Security Council. The question to be posed is whether the five long-time nuclear Powers will now accept that the only way to prevent nuclear proliferation is to abolish all nuclear weapons, a factor that has been repeatedly stressed in debates within these hallowed walls and in General Assembly resolutions. Or will the club quickly move beyond the present seven members? We urge that this matter be given the serious consideration it deserves, as we must commit ourselves to future generations. But we are presently dismayed about the future of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). Irrespective of the high praise given to globalization, to most of the developing world it hurts, and hurts excessively. For the past four years — that is, since the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) — disturbing signs have emerged of trends which point in the direction of exclusion rather than inclusion, and of marginalization rather than integration. And these trends are now having a serious negative effect on countries which recently were optimistically viewing their prospects. The multilateral financial institutions, which provide resources to developing countries at concessional rates, continue, despite numerous protests and logical arguments presented to them, to use gross national product as a basis for judging our economic wherewithal. Somehow, globalization and liberalization will work magic, irrespective of the existing and deep-seated problems of small States, it is assumed. The case of bananas must be highlighted. The undoing of the Lomé trade agreement, with the injury which this hostile act can inflict on the small banana-exporting countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, of which Antigua and Barbuda is a member, gives grave cause for concern. Small, peaceloving States, causing no harm to any other State under the terms of the Lomé agreement, have found themselves yoked by the World Trade Organization ruling. Without some form of protection, the banana industry in the 10 CARICOM States could collapse, leading to severe social dislocation, which would ultimately manifest itself in political catastrophe. The multilateral trading system needs to be fair and equitable, and the imbalances in the present agreements should be rectified. The benefits of the system should accrue to all States in relation to their needs, and not in proportion to their share in international trade. There needs to be recognition of the serious limitations of the principle of reciprocity as an instrument for mutually advantageous trading arrangements when the participating countries have different levels of development. The WTO must contribute to achieving positive coherence in global economic policy. Widespread and equitably shared economic growth will surely benefit all. In fact, the developed countries will be important beneficiaries of the economic growth and development of developing countries, which will provide larger markets and better opportunities, respectively, for their products and investment. This will also lead to global peace and prosperity, ensuring a truly stable framework for international relations based on mutuality of benefits. My Government welcomed the twentieth special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem, held between 8 and 10 June 1998. In the Caribbean the Non-Self-Governing Territories have the same problems in regard to narcotics as the independent countries. There is a multidimensional thrust upon our entities, as there is a challenge to governability by nonState actors and the drug operators. The influence of the drug-traffickers forces our Governments to shift very limited resources from development priorities to law enforcement and the rehabilitation of addicts. The social erosion, economic dislocation and increase in criminal activity mean that for small societies striving to overcome economic vulnerability it becomes a tremendous challenge to maintain functioning institutions in an environment with the potential for decreased productivity. Quite frankly, there is the possibility for all of us to become the involuntary victims of the drug trade. It is no secret that the small island developing States and low-lying coastal States of the Caribbean have inadequate defences against the vast resources of the drug-traffickers. In addition, if we are not sufficiently fearful of the devastation that can be caused by the illicit traffic in narcotics, we must be gravely concerned about the destruction that can accompany the attendant traffic in small arms and ammunition. In one of the most comprehensive plans of action on Caribbean policy and development, the West Indian Commission noted that nothing poses greater threats to civil society in CARICOM countries than the drug problem; and nothing exemplifies the powerlessness of regional Governments more. My Prime Minister addressed the issue of powerlessness of regional Governments in a recent statement to the Caribbean Studies Association. In that statement he referred to the dictatorial approach taken by certain countries. Given our limited capabilities, we acknowledge the importance of cooperation to develop mechanisms that can respond to incidents of drugtrafficking. We encourage collaboration, therefore, where appropriate, to achieve the desired results — the apprehension and conviction of criminals. Allow me to speak briefly on the subject of alternative development policies. Antigua and Barbuda and indeed other Caribbean countries that introduced an offshore financial services sector did so as a direct response to the perceived need to diversify our economies in the face of globalization and trade liberalization. On the one hand, when we choose the financial services sector and follow the example of other countries that have done so before us, we are labelled as havens for moneylaunderers and corruption, and steps are taken to undermine our efforts and limit the competitive advantage that we may enjoy. We do not believe that this approach lends itself to genuine partnership and mutual respect. What we need is collaboration, information exchange and technical support to assist us in ensuring that our financial services sector is not abused by dubious sources while it provides us with much needed economic resources. History clearly proves that drug abuse and illicit trafficking know no boundaries; no country is inoculated against their effects. It is logical to conclude, therefore, that the fight against drug-trafficking and abuse must transcend any individual country strategy. My Government supports an unbiased approach to the United Nations thematic agenda on drug control for the twenty-first century. The decision to focus on demand reduction, elimination of illicit crops, judicial cooperation, money-laundering, stemming illicit production of synthetic drugs and the control of drug-production chemicals must be consistent with the desire for a global strategy against drug-trafficking. The transnational nature of the drug problem warrants such concerted action to create the drug-free world that we all desire. 11 Antigua and Barbuda is committed to this global strategy. We have signed a number of interdiction agreements and appointed an official to coordinate national action against drug-trafficking and related crimes. This official works closely with the Attorney General to ensure formulation and implementation of the national drug policy. In addition to the policy initiatives, we are currently completing work on a drug treatment facility that we hope will be used not only as a centre for rehabilitation, but also as a training facility in the region. It seems logical that a word should be said here in regard to the adoption of the Statute for the International Criminal Court, as Caribbean nations had hoped that such a Court would aid in the elimination of the narcotic scourge. The media did not, to any significant extent, diffuse the idea that it was a Caribbean country, Trinidad and Tobago, that revived the idea for an international criminal court after a lapse of 41 years. In 1989 Trinidad and Tobago reintroduced to the United Nations the concept of 1948. But the specific reasons for establishing the Court as advanced by Trinidad and Tobago and other States of the Caribbean Community were put on the back burner. We had pleaded for a Court that would try to sentence those involved in the trans-shipment of narcotics, in terrorism and in marine abuses, including the violation of our territorial waters. What is before us is a Court emphasizing genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression. All of these we support, yet we are faced with a clear indication that we are still on the periphery. The West Indies have always been on the periphery of dominant economic systems — in reference, that is, to the post-Columbian era. The West Indies, since the initial period of colonization, have provided goods and services for more advanced industrial entities. The very nature of our colonization — that is, to exist as colonies of exploitation as opposed to colonies of settlement — demanded continued underdevelopment. The sad thing is that, today, the multilateral financial institutions which provide resources to developing countries at concessional rates continue to use gross national product as a basis for judging our economic wherewithal. The present situation in regard to my country provides a most germane example. The envoys of Antigua and Barbuda are basking in their glory because of the high ranking the country received in the 1998 Human Development Report. The laudations and accommodations received have been profuse, but this very factor puts forward the absurd premise that we are more developed than Mexico or Brazil. Antigua and Barbuda is deemed to be middle-income, and its numerous vulnerabilities are ignored as gross national product is the sole deciding factor. Our challenge is to convince the international agencies that we should be on the priority list for development loans and assistance. Antigua and Barbuda and other Caribbean countries have demonstrated how developing countries can use their limited resources for the advancement of their populations. We should not be penalized for progress. Small island developing States are constantly and continually at risk, whether through sea-level rise, hurricanes, earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, as has been the case with the emerald isle of Montserrat. A single hurricane can put back our development some 10 years. For ourselves, we have put out a plea for international assistance, as for the third time in three years we have been afflicted by a hurricane. Until the passage of hurricane Georges, our country had been advancing because of the prudent and experienced management for which we are known. We had built a network of superb roads and improved our telecommunications system, tourism had re-established itself after the powerful Hurricane Louis of 1995, new buildings including schools had been erected, and our economy was on course for 8 per cent growth by the end of the year. This, of course, duly manifests the absurdity of using gross national product as a basis for eliminating us from consideration for concessional loans. At present we have to ask our friends and well-wishers for assistance. In that connection, a draft resolution is being circulated on United Nations assistance to Caribbean countries affected by hurricane Georges. This year we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. My country will continue to focus on efforts to ensure that the protection of human rights is integrated into all activities of the United Nations system. We view seriously the many reports of child abuse worldwide. We are concerned about children affected by internecine warfare, and the now rampant tales of child labour, child prostitution and child pornography. Additionally, we will remain vigilant in seeing to the mainstreaming of women’s concerns. Overall, my country will be exercising efforts to see to the furtherance of endeavours to strengthen human rights programmes. In approaching the twenty-first century, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda has decided that it should focus on human capital and its development, rather 12 than focusing narrowly on the economic question. There will be a continuance of the policy of carrying out intense investigations and feasibility studies to decide on where to concentrate limited resources. In addition, even though the Government is divesting itself of some of its holdings and encouraging greater private investment in vital services and commodities, there are some areas, particularly those surrounding technology, in which the Government has to remain directly involved and catalytic; it will continue its practice of seeking consensus to determine key industries and activities that are crucial and critical for development. In concluding, a statement has to be made in regard to our appreciation for the work done in the Caribbean by the United Nations Development Programme. Particular thanks have to be expressed for its work in economic management and governance initiatives. We will continue to be proud of and to cherish the United Nations, as we recognize its capacity for achievements in areas beyond the reach of national or regional authorities. Subsequently, the nations that compose this Assembly must redouble their collective commitment to translate vision into reality. That is why it is essential to have international cooperation for development in the forefront of our activities. The United Nations is still our greatest hope for peace, development and social justice.   I bring the Assembly greetings from President Charles Taylor and the Government and the people of Liberia. On behalf of the delegation of Liberia and in my own name, I convey my sincere congratulations to Mr. Opertti on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. His unanimous election to this high office is a credit not only to him but also to his esteemed country. I assure him of my delegation?s fullest support and cooperation and wish him every success in the discharge of his duties. I should like also to register my delegation?s appreciation to the President?s distinguished predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, for the able manner in which he conducted the work of the fifty-second session. The many successes achieved during his tenure of office, especially in the reform of this Organization, attest to his diplomatic skills and his understanding of the problems which confront the Organization and our determined efforts to build a more just and humane international order that is responsive to the legitimate aspirations of all mankind. We offer special thanks to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his unrelenting pursuit of the implementation of the mandates entrusted to him by the Assembly. My delegation also commends him for his efforts aimed at the successful execution of the administrative reforms of the Secretariat, and the important focus he has placed on development, peacemaking and peace-building efforts, especially in Africa, as the most assured basis for sustainable development. The Secretary-General?s report (A/52/871) on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa provides an in-depth analysis of the social and economic ills of the Continent, which was thoroughly discussed at the ministerial meeting of the Security Council. We fully agree with his assertion that while African Governments must ultimately be held responsible for the problems confronting their countries, meaningful steps must be taken by this Organization to lend support to national measures aimed at alleviating these problems. In this connection, it is notable that on 6 October 1998, the United Nations will observe the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of its peacekeeping operations. Africa continues to benefit from the United Nations peacekeeping operations aimed at the resolution of conflicts on the continent pursuant to Chapter VIII of the Charter. While welcoming this cooperation, Liberia calls upon the Security Council to employ impartiality and non- selectivity in the execution of its primary role of maintaining international peace and security. The international political situation continues to be characterized by sustained efforts aimed at the maintenance of international peace and security. While there has been no major eruption of military confrontation between States, intra-State conflicts and civil wars in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea-Bissau, the Sudan and Kosovo, and the territorial dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea have claimed the attention of regional and subregional organizations such as the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union and the Organization of African Unity (OAU). These organizations and regional bodies are endeavouring, with the complementary support of the United Nations, to seek negotiated peaceful solutions and to minimize the humanitarian crises, refugee flows and internal displacement caused by conflicts and wars. With regard to the Middle East, my delegation is deeply concerned about the lack of progress, particularly in connection with the Madrid Conference and the Oslo accords. We are of the view that new initiatives should be undertaken to restart the peace process, focusing on the understanding reached by the parties. Liberia will support renewed efforts by the international community that seek to bring the volatile situation in that region to a fair and equitable conclusion. The rise in acts of terrorism threatens the independence, sovereignty, freedom, economic and social development of all States. It cannot be overemphasized that terrorism has no justification as a means to solve political differences. Therefore, the Government of Liberia strongly condemns the bombings in Dar-es- Salaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya. It is imperative that concerted actions be taken to combat this unwholesome phenomenon which has no bounds. Liberia is in accord with the proposal of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt for the convening of an international conference on terrorism to deliberate on the issue. The world is faced with the frightening prospect of an increase in the number of States with nuclear capability, as well as the proliferation of conventional weapons. We therefore call for more States to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). There is an urgent need to curtail the trafficking in small arms and to promote greater transparency in arms transfers. The scourge of the worldwide drug problem necessitated the convening of the drug summit in New York in June of this year. It is a source of concern that drug sales have overtaken trade in other commodities, and the money value of this illegal act has reached over $400 billion annually. My Government reaffirms its commitment to tackling the drug problem within its borders and to cooperating at the regional and international levels in keeping with the Political Declaration and the guiding principles outlined at the conclusion of the summit. The 1990s have been declared an era of globalization. However, the rapid growth of international trade and financial flows has affected most economies in profound ways. Globalization threatens the weak and vulnerable by marginalizing them in the global economic system. For most developing countries, the debt overhang and unequal participation in the regulation of commodity pricing, declining official development assistance and capital flows are perennial problems that hamper their economic development and integration into the world 2 economy. My delegation therefore joins in the call for the industrialized countries to bring about equity in the regulatory framework for the financial and exchange markets. In this connection, Liberia reaffirms its support for the position of the Non-Aligned Movement summit, held recently in Durban, South Africa, that developed countries be urged to accelerate the review of the world financial system, thus ensuring that capital flows were supportive of expansion in trade, employment and development. In addition, there is the need to boost development aid from Western countries and to remove restrictive conditions linked to receiving international assistance. In particular, my Government welcomes the call by President William Clinton of the United States of America for a meeting in Washington, D.C., in mid-October of this year, of finance ministers and central bank governors from nations of the G-7 and emerging economies to debate steps to shore up the tottering global financial system. His reaffirmation of this proposal, as well as his pledge made to this Assembly on 21 September last, to forge a partnership with Africa, deserves our commendation and support. Also, we cannot agree more with the Secretary- General that the United Nations should be included in the discussion. Its participation will give more international credibility to the decisions that would emerge from the meeting. Even though recent indicators point to improvement in the economies of several African countries, the vast majority continue to experience negative growth. The largest number of least developed countries are in Africa, and the crippling effects of the heavy external debt and decline in investment and financial flows have been major contributors to the poor economic performance of these countries. There is a need for concerted international action to remedy this state of affairs. The United Nations system- wide support for the development of Africa is a step in the right direction. My delegation welcomes the recent decision of the substantive session of the Economic and Social Council, held in July of this year, and the Council?s ministerial communiqué on market access for exports from least developed countries, as well as capacity-building and in- service infrastructure development. These decisions deserve full support and should be implemented by Member States. In this connection, the important initiative taken by the Government of Japan, a prominent member of the G-7, to urgently address Africa?s development has the highest commendation of my Government and the appreciation of all African States. My delegation looks forward to actively participating in the important ministerial meeting which will be convened in Tokyo next month on Africa?s economic recovery. Moreover, this initiative deserves the wholehearted support of Member States of this Organization, particularly the developed countries. My delegation notes with satisfaction the efforts by the United Nations to harmonize the issues of development and the environment. With respect to the environment, the decision reached on Agenda 21 during the 1992 Rio Conference is the most comprehensive effort undertaken by the international community to raise awareness of the degradation of the environment and the need to reverse the negative trend. We trust that the issue of the environment will remain a priority on the global agenda. One important and unquestionable achievement for our Organization to celebrate is the great improvement in the universal character of the Organization. Nevertheless, more efforts must be deployed to ensure that every country becomes a member of this Organization. My delegation believes that in that regard, the exceptional situation of the Republic of China on Taiwan must be examined with a view to the unification of the Chinese people based on their own will and decision. However, we also believe that it is the responsibility of this Organization to provide the impetus for the unification of the two Chinas. History is replete with examples of the membership in this Organization of divided countries, where unification was peacefully settled under the aegis of the United Nations. We have confidence in the ability of the United Nations to allow history to be repeated on a similar matter of grave importance to this Organization. In the interest of equity and the maintenance of regional peace and security, my country calls for the parallel representation in the United Nations of the People?s Republic of China and the Republic of China on Taiwan. The matter of reform is one that needs no justification. It is an imperative for the continued relevance of the United Nations. An Organization made up of 185 Member States must, by its nature, allow fair play and democracy to prevail, and not the rule of weighted influence. The tenets of the United Nations Charter do not submit to the principle of “might makes right”, but to the enlightened principles of international law which emerge from the objective need for peaceful coexistence. Unless the powerful States recognize this 3 imperative, the international system will move towards international anarchy rather than towards a more humane, peaceful and stable world order. These reforms will be meaningless unless parallel reforms can be achieved within the Bretton Woods institutions, the very essence of weighted and undemocratic global influence. On the question of increase in the membership of the Security Council, Liberia reaffirms its support for an increase for Africa and other under-represented regions on the basis of equitable geographical representation, consistent with the decisions of the Organization of African Unity and the Non-Aligned Movement. During the fifty-second session of the General Assembly, it was my honour to read the prepared text of Mr. Charles Taylor, President of the Republic of Liberia, to this Assembly. At that time, only two months had passed since his assumption of the leadership of Liberia, following seven years of civil war and the holding of democratic elections in the country. Since then, the Government has undertaken measures towards the rebuilding of the country, national reconciliation, rehabilitation, repatriation and resettlement. In light of this, from 19 July to 12 August 1998, the people of Liberia participated in a national conference to deliberate on the future of Liberia under the theme “Vision 2024”. This historic undertaking not only reaffirmed President Taylor?s commitment to participatory democracy but also afforded a unique opportunity for Liberians at home and abroad to freely deliberate on and propose solutions for the building of a new Liberia. At the conclusion of the conference, a commission was established and given the responsibility to seek full implementation of the decisions reached. Those decisions ranged from decentralization of the Government to the enactment of legislation covering all facets of the society. My Government has attached high priority to the implementation of the decisions of the national conference, since it has helped produce an agenda which complements that of the Government and identifies issues and measures as well as courses of action that could be adopted for the stability and development of Liberia. President Taylor is aware that the key to Liberia?s stability and development lies in fostering genuine reconciliation among Liberians. A human rights commission established since the inception of the Government continues to function. The protection of human rights will remain one of the cornerstones of Liberia?s domestic policy. This is why my Government has now undertaken legislative action to ratify and accede to all human rights instruments as a concrete attestation of our commitment to promote and protect human rights in Liberia. Convinced that democracy is indispensable for development, the Government has also undertaken measures to realize its intention to build institutions to consolidate the democratic process in the country. We have encouraged the continued existence and growth of the 13 political parties that participated in the last elections. We hold regular consultations with these parties concerning national issues. We believe that these efforts are necessary for the dynamic development of a modern Liberia. Meanwhile, international support remains a necessity in order for Liberia to find its way forward and consolidate the gains made by the return to civilian, constitutional rule. Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter vests the Security Council with the authority to decide what measures may be taken to maintain or restore international peace and security, following a determination of the existence of any threat to peace, breach of the peace or act of aggression. In a number of cases, the imposition of a sanctions regime or embargo by the Council has yielded, with minimal collateral harm, the results for which punitive measures were authorized. However, in other cases, sanctions have led to grave and intolerable humanitarian crises which have deprived large numbers of innocent and vulnerable persons, mainly women and children, of their most basic needs, while not achieving their intended objectives. Within this context, the Government of Liberia believes that any sanctions regime should clearly define the punitive measure, its specific target, a definite time- frame and exemptions to mitigate the unintended harmful consequences for the whole population of a given country and those of contiguous States. In 1992, during Liberia?s civil war, the ECOWAS subregional grouping imposed an arms embargo on Liberia as a means to facilitate the peace process and reduce the level of violence. ECOWAS also further 4 appealed to the Security Council to facilitate the universal application of the embargo, an appeal the Security Council heeded positively by adopting a resolution imposing an arms embargo on Liberia. By 1997, the Liberian civil war was brought to an end through the process of a negotiated political settlement, disarmament, demobilization and the holding of free and fair democratic elections. After the inauguration of the elected and constitutional Government, ECOWAS lifted all sanctions and embargoes imposed against Liberia and called upon the international community to do the same. The Government of Liberia, since its assumption of office, has repeatedly called upon the Security Council to lift the arms embargo, an appeal that has fallen on deaf ears. The Liberian Government has a constitutional responsibility and a sovereign right to defend, protect and preserve the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic. We strongly believe that the arms embargo currently in force against Liberia is patently unfair since it is open- ended and provides no criteria for the lifting of the embargo, as has been the procedure in other, similar cases. Moreover, the intent and purpose of the 1992 arms embargo have been achieved by the peaceful resolution of the Liberian civil crisis through the holding of democratic elections in Liberia and the installation of the Government headed by President Charles Taylor on 2 August 1997. As a responsible member of the international community, Liberia would accede to the wishes of the Security Council if it were decided that there was justification for the maintenance of sanctions against Liberia based on concrete facts or a violation of international law or covenants. However, to do so under a sanctions regime that no longer has validity is unwarranted and inimical to the interests of the country. The Government of Liberia requests that the Security Council take cognizance of Liberia?s legitimate aspirations and constitutional obligation to its people. It should be noted that in spite of the support of the Liberian people for their Government, there may remain some disgruntled citizens and external actors who seek to disturb the peace and reverse the progress achieved thus far by capitalizing on the perceived inability of the Government to adequately protect itself because of the present arms embargo on the country. For the Security Council to place a Member State of this Organization in such an untenable position is inimical to the interests of the Liberian Government and people and inconsistent with the purposes and principles of the United Nations. The Government of Liberia calls on the Security Council to impartially assume its responsibility under the Charter by expeditiously redressing what is considered to be an injustice to Liberia by lifting its 1992 arms embargo, imposed on the country for the reasons already mentioned. At the threshold of the twenty-first century, it must be recognized that the full achievement of the goals and objectives of this Organization has been largely undermined by the long period of the cold war. Its demise held out the promise of a peace dividend that was to be applied to the development activities of the United Nations. Regrettably, that is not the case today. However, within a renewed, principled spirit of interdependence, the international community can evolve an effective means of partnership and cooperation to achieve equity in the areas of economic development and social advancement as necessary conditions for the maintenance of global peace and security. By so doing, we will have crafted a workable agenda that will propel the human family into the new millennium with the hope of a just world order that is responsive to the needs of all inhabitants of our common planet, as envisaged in the Charter. Let me give the assurance that Liberia remains committed to this basic goal in the same determined manner as when it signed the Charter of the United Nations in 1945. I wish first to convey to Mr. Didier Opertti the warm, sincere congratulations of the Government and the delegation of Gabon on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. This is a tribute to his country, Uruguay, and an unambiguous recognition of his personal and professional qualities. Our congratulations go also to all the other Assembly officers, and we wish them every success in guiding our work. We assure them of the support and cooperation of the delegation of Gabon. To the President of the General Assembly at the fifty- second session, Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko, who spared no effort in carrying out his responsibilities, I convey our satisfaction and our deep gratitude. The present times are characterized by political tension, by change and by socio-economic upheaval exacerbated by a grave financial crisis; our involvement is required, in more than one respect. Gabon remains convinced that the United Nations continues to be the best forum for working together to harmonize our different approaches towards peace and development. We owe it to ourselves to consider the circumstances in which the Organization was established to free the world from the spectre of war. Was it just to prevent world war, or was it to make use of the renewed humanism inspired by the San Francisco Conference to eradicate all the causes of armed conflict wherever they might emerge so as, in the words of the Charter, “to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom”? Now more than in the past, and especially since the end of the cold war, narrow nationalism has been resurfacing to nullify all the international community?s efforts to make of our world a global village in which peace and security, friendship among nations and international cooperation are the watchwords. Peace is a sine qua non for the development of peoples and of nations. That truth is easy enough to affirm, but applying it is complicated by the play of interests within States, often combined with outside interference. This has been and remains the bitter experience of Africa. For nearly a decade, the African continent has faced multifaceted political tension and violence between and within States, just when the end of the cold war had given rise to hope that resources would be mobilized for its development. Yet during that same period many African countries have courageously embarked on political reform and economic restructuring. Overall, there has been tangible progress. Clearly, stability is indispensable for such progress, which means that questions of international peace and security are the concern of the day on our continent, and more specifically in Central Africa. That subregion, so rich in potential, has come since the end of the cold war to be a world disrupted by “the disorder of nations”, fuelled and maintained by a variety of forces. Although living in peace within its borders and with its neighbours, Gabon is extremely concerned at this situation. President Bongo believes that our country cannot remain an isle of peace, freedom and even relative prosperity in an ocean of misery, violence and fratricidal wars. That concern is shared by the other heads of State of Central Africa, and was at the root of the summit conference held on Thursday, 24 September 1998, at Libreville, at the initiative of President Bongo, on the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That important meeting gave heads of State and heads of delegation an opportunity to express their support for President Kabila and to condemn the aggression against the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the interference in the internal affairs of that country. They called for the withdrawal of foreign forces of aggression; for a ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; for respect for the territorial integrity of that country; and for continuing the process of democratization begun by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They also stressed the need for concerted action by the countries of Central Africa, the States members of the Southern African Development Community, of the Organization of African Unity and of the United Nations, and all those who are working to find a solution to the Congo crisis, renouncing any partisan decisions that could prolong the suffering of the peoples of Congo and of neighbouring States. The heads of State and heads of delegation of Central Africa therefore decided to establish a summit follow-up and negotiating committee under the chairmanship of the President of the Gabonese Republic, and reaffirmed that it would be appropriate to establish a regional peacekeeping force. Turning to Angola, I wish first to honour the memory of the Special Representative of the Secretary- General, Matre Alioune Blondin Beye, and of members of his team, who worked tirelessly for peace in that country, tragically giving their lives to that cause. The heads of State and of delegation reaffirmed at the Libreville summit their support for the Government of Angola, which is sparing no effort in the search for 25 lasting peace in that country and for the full and speedy implementation of the Lusaka accords. Finally, with regard to the Republic of the Congo, the heads of State supported the reconstruction and national reconciliation efforts and condemned the destabilization manoeuvres originating outside the country. Of course, we are not insensitive to the disturbances and violence occurring in other parts of the world — quite the contrary. Gabon shares the position of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) on ways and means of resolving the problems in Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia and Somalia and between Ethiopia and Eritrea. We are following most attentively the resumption of dialogue between the Israelis and Palestinians, as seen in the recent summit meetings. These talks offer a glimmer of hope for a global settlement of the problems of the Middle East. We likewise believe that only political means will return peace to Afghanistan. With the same conviction, we encourage the efforts of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to preserve peace in South-East Asia. A global vision of peace is certainly necessary. In fact, through the phenomenon of globalization, the shock wave of conflict is often felt very far from the epicentre. It is equally clear that development cannot be ensured in an unstable environment, for peace constitutes the fertile ground in which development must take root and prosper. It is in that spirit that Gabon studied the remarkable report (A/52/871) that the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, submitted to the Security Council on the causes of conflict in Africa. He very rightly noted that historical legacies, internal and external factors, economic motives and particular situations are the source of many conflicts in Africa. These various causes are known to us and we must combat them. In this respect, I would like to draw the attention of the Assembly particularly to one of the causes of conflict that I believe should be given our full attention because of the many dangers it poses to the stability of our entire continent. Furthermore, this phenomenon is also evident in Central and Eastern Europe. I refer to the question of transnational populations — in other words, communities dispersed over several States as a result of various historical circumstances. Aware of the danger in Africa, the founding fathers of the OAU, in their great wisdom, inscribed in its Charter the principle of the inviolability of frontiers inherited from colonization. To reshape States on the basis of diverse claims seemed to them to be simply risky. They therefore chose to take charge of our history through the openness of integration. Gabon reaffirms its support for this approach. All in all, the resurgence of nationalism, poor understanding and abuse of the rights of peoples as well as their manipulation, inevitably lead to national unrest, with its attendant deadly difficulties. Faced with these realities and possibilities, the Government of Gabon would more than ever like to reaffirm its commitment to certain principles which underlie the maintenance of peace and security, both internally and internationally. These include respect for human rights in general and for the rights of national minorities in particular; respect for cultural identities; respect for the territorial integrity of States; respect for national sovereignty; the principle of non-interference in internal affairs; the principle of good neighbourliness; and the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes. In any event, dialogue remains the best and most effective way of preventing conflicts and maintaining or restoring peace. Political differences must have a political response. The African populations, already overwhelmed by underdevelopment, cannot and should not have to endure, in addition, the deadly consequences of conflict. We must therefore always engage in dialogue. This is why President Bongo, sensing the changes in history and the aspirations of his people, set in motion in mid-1989 the rethinking within the former single party in our country that led to the national conference of March-April 1990, which reopened the way to pluralism and democracy. New regulatory and control institutions have gradually been established since then and they are working. Individual and collective freedoms are recognized and enjoyed by our citizens, who can even appeal as high as the Constitutional Court, as a glance at our newspapers in Gabon suffices to make clear. This shows how deeply committed we are to the principles of participatory democracy, taking into account our overall level of development and our sociological environment. It is also in this new context that in two months we shall be organizing presidential elections for the second time. The logistical and legislative preparations are already at a very advanced stage; they are basically the work of government. The National Electoral Commission, which is already in place, will conduct the actual electoral operations. Its representatives were appointed last week in all departments and communes. The Prime Minister sent 26 invitations a month ago to various States and organizations, including the United Nations, to observe both the preparations and the polling process itself. A few days ago I had the opportunity to address the Security Council on mechanisms for conflict prevention in our subregion. Without repeating the report that has been made to the Assembly, I would like to recall here that, in accordance with the decision made by the heads of State or Government of the countries of Central Africa, Defence and Interior Ministers of the countries members of the United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa, meeting in Libreville from 28 to 30 April 1998, re-examined the plan for the establishment of an early-warning mechanism as an instrument for the prevention of crises and conflicts. Gabon, which now holds the chairmanship of the Committee, is doing everything in its power to meet the logistics needs to allow Libreville to be the headquarters of that mechanism. Along the same lines, also concerning the logic of prevention, the Committee held from 18 to 21 May 1998 in Bata, Equatorial Guinea, the first conference on the question of relationships between democratic institutions and peace in Central Africa. That conference brought together members of Governments, representatives of opposition political parties, high-ranking officials of the forces of law and order, representatives of civil society and experts on matters of political freedoms, the press and human rights. The participants? main recommendation was the establishment of a subregional parliament of Central Africa, which would be charged with dealing with questions of common interest, with a view to strengthening measures for confidence-building and subregional peace, while serving as a forum for harmonization of views and the promotion of values related to the democratic experiences of member States. In general, we can say that the action of the Committee is a needed extension of the Organization of African Unity?s Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution. All these preventive measures would be in vain if the international community made no further disarmament efforts. My country supports the high priority given by the United Nations to the question of disarmament in general and to the elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in particular. Even if the harm they can cause is less, we are also concerned about the proliferation of conventional weapons, which are also tools of death and destruction. We therefore commend the statement by the President of the Security Council on the occasion of the ministerial meeting on Africa held on 24 September 1998, in which the Council asked the ad hoc Working Group to elaborate further concrete recommendations on the need to stem illicit arms flows to and in Africa. Apart from these concerns, we have certain grounds for satisfaction. Disarmament took a step forward very recently with the adoption of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, which I personally signed on behalf of Gabon on 4 December 1997 in Ottawa, and which has just entered into force with the deposit of the fortieth instrument of ratification by an African country, Burkina Faso. Other significant instruments, such as the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Comprehensive Nuclear- Test-Ban Treaty, have become a reality. Gabon, convinced of the prominent role of disarmament in the maintenance of international peace and security, is a signatory of these important instruments. My country invites all States Members of the United Nations to work towards complete and general disarmament in the twenty- first century, the guarantor of a lasting peace. We must make the quest for peace a cardinal point of reference. However, that peace will remain in jeopardy as long as the basic needs of peoples are not met. The persistence of conflicts, non-respect for the human person, hatred and the rejection of democratic values all have serious repercussions on the economic health of States. Likewise, the phenomenon of refugees and displaced persons, epidemics and the cost of reconstruction in the wake of war all are burdens that affect already fragile economies and aggravate difficult social situations. The situation at this end of century makes it imperative for the international community to deal with development and social issues if we wish to prevent our world from self-destructing. The content of the 1998 Human Development Report, published by the United Nations Development Programme a few weeks ago, strengthens this conviction. The conclusions of the 1995 Copenhagen summit therefore remain valid, and the United Nations must again take the initiative. Statements of intention no longer suffice. We need concrete action and realistic programmes that take into account the phenomenon of globalization. These 27 programmes must ensure that no one is excluded and that each of our nations, by making the necessary efforts to adapt, can become integrated in the most harmonious way possible. That is why Gabon believes it necessary to relaunch the idea of a new partnership based on fairness in order to respond to the legitimate aspirations of people — mainly, to eliminate poverty and to promote well-being. With globalization, States? autonomy and room for manoeuvre has been greatly reduced. The power of Governments is offset by the power of the markets. Openness and freedom, however, must not come to mean free rein to establish the law of the jungle, in which we, the small and the weak, will inevitably be crushed and destroyed. In this context, it seemed necessary to the Government of Gabon not to abdicate but to refocus the role of the State. A new direction has been reflected, inter alia, through an ambitious programme of liberalization of economic activities on the one hand and on the other by the privatization of large sectoral public enterprises. As for the structure of the economy of Gabon, let me say that our country remains dependent on the sale of three principal raw materials: oil, wood and manganese. The prices of these products have been on the decline for several months now. If we factor in the fluctuations in the United States dollar, which is also on the decline, we can see that the result is a decrease in the income of the State, which puts the country?s investment and development capacities in considerable jeopardy. This fact is not the only handicap to my country?s development. The debt and its servicing absorb almost 45 per cent of our budgetary resources. This is truly intolerable. All of this notwithstanding, the international financial institutions continue to classify Gabon as an upper middle- income country, thus preventing its access to financing on flexible terms. Gabon is the only sub-Saharan African country in this situation, which is simply unjust. Gabon, a developing country just like any other, asks that international financial institutions apply new assessment criteria and, above all, that they give more appropriate consideration to our debt burden in order further to unleash our productive capabilities. This would benefit not only the people of Gabon but also our partners abroad. Other major problems must also mobilize the international community, inter alia, the drug problem, terrorism, major pandemics, human rights and the environment. The General Assembly held its twentieth special session on the fight against drugs last June. Gabon is pleased that on that occasion our Organization enshrined the criminal nature of the traffic in drugs and broadened the options for solutions to this scourge at the global level. That session gave political impetus to the international efforts of States in the fight against drug trafficking, which now spares no country. The Government of Gabon invites the United Nations and its specialized agencies to further support the efforts made in this respect at the regional level. As for the scourge of terrorism, and bearing in mind the horrible attacks in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, I must first of all pay a tribute of compassion and respect to the memory of the Kenyan, Tanzanian and American citizens who lost their lives there. I express my deepest sympathy to all of those persons who were wounded. Above all, the Government of Gabon most forcefully reaffirms its condemnation of acts of terrorism in all their manifestations, wherever they may occur. We believe that no cause can justify resorting to such acts. But I also denounce certain retaliatory measures that they inspire, in particular the placing of countries that are suspected of involvement under embargo. This type of response is neither appropriate nor efficient. In most cases, those types of measures affect mainly innocent civilian populations. We believe, therefore, that under the auspices of the United Nations, urgent dialogue must be undertaken to explore ways and means of preventing and combating terrorism. In the field of human rights, Gabon welcomes the creation of an International Criminal Court, as established by the Statute adopted at Rome on 17 July last. The same applies to the Organization of African Unity Protocol, which created, at the organization?s thirty-fourth summit, a Pan-African Court of Justice. Because of industrial development, environmental questions have become an increasingly pressing concern for the international community. The awareness to which the Rio Summit gave rise unfortunately was not followed up by the concrete measures that were expected. Commitments have not been fulfilled, and as time goes 28 by, the Rio consensus must lead us more than ever towards a necessary commitment if we wish to avoid its remaining a dead letter. I should like also to take this opportunity to express my delegation?s satisfaction with, and its support for, the efforts made by the International Seabed Authority, the guarantor of a common heritage of humankind, in the consideration of a draft code on the mining, exploration and exploitation of the seabed. We must make sincere and tireless efforts on all of these major issues. I very much appreciate the work of our Organization, which, through its executing bodies, its specialized agencies and with the support of other organizations, is making every effort to achieve these noble objectives. As I already said last year, Gabon supports the idea that the United Nations system needs rational and consistent renewal, in keeping with today?s realities. The proposals of the Secretary-General on the reform of the budgetary, administrative, social and economic sectors reflect a spirit of innovation that will make it possible to face the challenges of the new millennium. More specifically, as regards the thorny question of the expansion of the Security Council, Gabon is, of course, in favour of it. We believe Africa should have two permanent seats — I repeat, two permanent seats — which would be occupied on a rotational basis by all African countries — I repeat, all African countries — in accordance with modalities to be determined by them. Before concluding, allow me to commend the achievements of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. We know his task is immense and difficult. He has already accomplished a great deal, with courage and skill. I have already mentioned the promising views he shared with the Security Council on the eradication of conflicts and the promotion of lasting peace in Africa. For Africa, and for the entire international community, we must encourage and support him.  On behalf of the delegation of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, I would like to extend our warmest congratulations to you, Sir, upon your election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. I am convinced that under your wise guidance the work of this session will be crowned with success. I wish also to express our high appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko, for his major contribution during the fifty-second session, which benefited from his effectiveness as President. I warmly congratulate the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his active contribution over the past year to the activities of the United Nations and to the reform process. An eventful year has elapsed since the fifty-second session. While undergoing the intense and unpredictable impact generated by the unprecedented financial and monetary crisis, the world community has had to face tremendous challenges emerging out of tensions and conflicts in many corners of the world, out of policies of hegemony and imposition, and out of social injustice and the growing gap between rich and poor countries. However, peace, stability and cooperation for development continue to mark the prevailing international trend; that trend derives from the age-old aspirations of humankind and, above all, from the pressing demand of all peoples in the face of today?s swiftly changing and complex world. That prevailing trend is becoming all the more established in a world context of growing interdependence and of the speedier pace of globalization and regionalization. This situation also presents the international community with as many challenges as opportunities. It must therefore be emphasized that least developed and developing countries are also confronted with considerable challenges, and that the world?s development takes place in a context of various closely linked factors that have reciprocal impacts. In the light of the many important advances that have been made in science and technology, no one can deny the role played by developed countries. But the overall development of the integrated global economy cannot occur without the active participation of developing countries, which account for the majority of the members of the international community. Globalization is characterized principally by the rapid expansion of trade and economic relations and the swift movement of capital at the international level. We must nevertheless acknowledge that despite the twelve- fold growth in the global volume of trade since the end of the Second World War, the share of developing countries registered just a modest increase while that of least developed countries has been halved in the last two decades and currently stands at 0.4 per cent of the total value of international trade. Since the world?s capital moves faster than trade grows, developed countries are the principal beneficiaries of these resources, with the rest going to a limited number of developing countries. In an environment of economic opening up, characterized by the growing liberalization of trade and investment, developing countries — having undercapitalized industries, less efficient management and dilapidated equipment — have to confront unequal and relentless competition in which absolute superiority is enjoyed by countries that have advanced technologies at their disposal and to multinational corporations whose revenues are sometimes even higher than the gross national product of some countries. Undoubtedly, this cannot but cause concern to the developing and least developed countries that are beginning their global and regional economic integration. Additionally, although the current financial and monetary crisis began in East Asia, it is no longer an East Asian phenomenon, but has spread like an oil slick to the rest of the world and now resembles a dangerous storm causing unpredictable losses across many countries in different continents. This illustrates the negative side effects of globalization and provides additional proof of the fact that the greater the rate of globalization, the more interrelated both developed and developing economies become and the more they influence one another. This situation calls for the international community?s programme of action to include mutual cooperation between the developed countries and developing and least developed countries; and among countries that have strong economies, international institutions and the countries in crisis. It is only through this basic approach of mutual assistance that developing countries and 27 countries in crisis will have an opportunity to join in the efforts of the developed countries to overcome the problems and make the global economy?s growth more stable, which in the long run will benefit everyone. Obviously, such cooperation and mutual assistance must be based on mutual interest and respect. It can certainly be said that in a situation of generalized crisis, going to someone else?s aid means saving oneself. We believe that in adopting this approach, developing countries and countries in crisis should fully exploit their own domestic strengths and mobilize their existing potential to speed up and take advantage of international aid and cooperation. As far as external aid is concerned, we believe that the individual conditions of each recipient country should be taken into account in order to avoid the imposition of any remedy that might worsen its situation and cause unforeseen effects to social stability. Furthermore, we are convinced that in implementing these measures to stimulate liberalization, attention should be paid to the diversity of the global economy, as well as to the heterogeneous nature of national and regional economies. This is the only approach capable of ensuring the efficiency of our cooperation, the beneficial quality of our ties and our common prosperity. In this light, we would like to express the following hopes. More than ever, developed countries should facilitate access to their markets, accord most-favoured-nation status to developing countries — especially those countries which have been ravaged by the crisis or are suffering from its consequences — and include them in the Generalized System of Preferences. They should also support developing and least developed countries. It is more necessary than ever to maintain the level of official development assistance. This is not only necessary to halt the downward trend, but also for donor countries to seek to reach the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product devoted to development by donor countries. Moreover, this assistance is considered important for developing countries because it allows them to strengthen their energy resources and contributes to building both their economic and social infrastructures, elements which are essential for development and in order to attract foreign investments. The role of multilateral institutions — particularly that of the United Nations — is very important in resolving the long- and short-term problems of developing nations. However, it is regrettable that United Nations assistance to developing countries is continuing to decline. We therefore welcome the adoption of measures by the United Nations to improve the quality of its development cooperation, as well as the initiative of the Secretary- General to create a Development Account using the savings realized from reductions in administrative costs. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), along with other international organizations and bilateral and multilateral donors, is currently working to find solutions to the urgent problems of developing and least developed countries. Viet Nam has in recent years benefited from their considerable assistance, which ranged from restructuring the economy into a market economy to specific activities in different areas of society, particularly in the battle to eliminate famine and reduce poverty. More recently, the effective support provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) through the implementation of a tripartite agricultural cooperation mechanism agreed among FAO itself, Viet Nam and certain African countries has yielded encouraging results. We hope that on the basis of that experience, the United Nations will focus more on development issues and create conditions that are more favourable for providing assistance to the developing and less developed countries. In recent years, we have witnessed the formation and expansion of linkages among countries at the regional, interregional, intercontinental and global levels. These multi-level linkages among States also give rise to favourable conditions for all nations to exploit their comparative advantages, and they give impetus to increased mutual assistance among various partners, which leads to more equitable and sustainable growth within each region as well as among regions. Peace, stability and development are closely interrelated, like companions on the road to prosperity. Our own experience has taught us that a peaceful environment and political and social stability are indispensable for a nation to devote itself to achieving economic development. In turn, a more developed economy and improved living standards help strengthen political and social stability and thus preserve peace. Two opposing tendencies have characterized the world security situation since the fifty-second session. On the one hand, numerous events have shown a continuing trend of peace and improved relations among countries, 28 as evidenced by fact that the peaceful settlement of certain decades-long conflicts is under way and that relations among nations, including major Powers, continue to improve. On the other hand, we are witnessing on a daily basis bloodshed and confrontation in many regions, from the Middle East to Africa, from the Balkans to South Asia, and so on. The arms race continues unabated. One terrorist act follows on the heels of another. The list of countries to be “punished” is not getting any shorter, and the direct victims continue to be the elderly and women and children. Our planet is thus not yet out of the reach of the Damocles sword of insecurity. The painful lessons of the twentieth century — a century replete with conflicts and wars, including the two World Wars, which claimed tens of millions of lives — and the burning desire of humankind for a better life on the eve of the new century require that we all redouble our efforts to achieve a solid and lasting peace. In today?s world, such a peace will be achieved only if every people and every State — large or small, rich or poor, wherever its location — make every effort in jointly working towards it. Such a peace can be achieved only if it is based on a strict observance in international relations of the principle of respect for independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity; non-intervention in one another?s internal affairs; the non-use or threat of use of force; and sanctions. Such a peace will be established only when the goal of total disarmament is achieved, first and foremost through the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. In this spirit, all States must put an end to the production, testing, stockpiling, proliferation, use or threat of use of these weapons. South-East Asia, as an integral part of the planet, is affected by current global developments. In these last 50 years, it has been a hotbed of conflicts and disputes and the scene of numerous bloody wars and crises. But today South-East Asia?s luck is changing, and an atmosphere of peace, stability and cooperation for development prevails. The membership of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has increased, bringing it closer to its goal of 10 member countries and helping to put an end to the region?s historical divisions. The South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty has been signed. Nevertheless, problems remain, including sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea, that must be resolved in order to ensure peace and stability for all countries in the region. We believe, however, that tensions can be avoided if all parties concerned practise self-restraint; refrain from aggravating the situation; ensure freedom of international maritime transportation; settle their disputes through negotiation on the basis of respect for international law, particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea; and, in the immediate future, seek to identify patterns of cooperation acceptable to all sides. This is in line with the all-out efforts by the countries of the region to build neighbourly relationships of friendship and cooperation based on the principle of mutual respect. In this spirit, as Cambodia?s immediate neighbour, we welcome the success beyond expectations of the Cambodian elections last July, which were recognized to be free and fair by the entire international community. We sincerely hope that this will lead to the early formation of a new government in Cambodia that will set the Cambodian people on the road to building and developing their country in conditions of peace and stability. Regrettably, East Asia in general and South-East Asia in particular, reputed in past decades to be the world?s most dynamic economic growth area, are suffering an unprecedentedly serious crisis. This has led certain people hastily to declare the demise of the miracle of the East Asian development model and even go so far as to reject “Asian values”. I would humbly suggest that such views are groundless. Indeed, the current crisis in East Asia is neither the first nor the last in the history of the market economy. Although some errors were made, the East Asia and South-East Asia development model has already provided quite a few valuable experiences and useful lessons. Are not the virtues of studiousness, industriousness, thrift, intelligence, creativity and caring for one another eternal and universal values? Moreover, there remain substantial economic foundations, unique cultures and the achievements of the people of the region realized thanks to their hard work and creativity — not to mention other positive factors, such as the region?s abundant natural resources, large internal market and major role in world politics and economics. The existence and growth of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been another positive factor in the development of South-East Asia. Despite difficulties and challenges, ASEAN continues to 29 become more unified, promote cooperation and play an active role in Asia and the Pacific and the world, not only through intensive interactions with dialogue partners and other international and regional organizations, but also by means of its vigorous work in different multilateral forums: the ASEAN Regional Forum, the Asia/Europe Meeting, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Non-Aligned Movement and the United Nations itself. After successfully hosting the seventh summit of the French-speaking community in November 1997, Viet Nam has the great honour to again play host — this time to the sixth ASEAN Summit, which will be held in Hanoi this December. The Summit, whose theme will be strengthening unity and broadening cooperation for a South-East Asia of peace, stability and balanced development, will adopt the Hanoi declaration and plan of action, which will guide South-East Asia as it enters the next century. As a result of the factors I have outlined, we are firmly convinced that South-East Asia will soon overcome its difficulties and regain its previous pace of growth, and that the international community will continue to regard the region as a promising and reliable partner. To build peace and promote development, it is urgently important to reform the United Nations, to make it more democratic and better adapted to confront the profound changes that have taken place in the world in the 50 years since the Organization was founded. We all agree that it is essential to reform the Security Council so that it will be more democratic, more transparent and more accountable to the General Assembly, the biggest and most representative forum of the community of nations. Viet Nam and its Non-Aligned Movement partners are committed to the position that the developing countries should be represented in the Security Council through permanent membership. In view of the legitimate interests of potential candidates, Viet Nam will support the rotation formula if a majority of countries accept it. Our country also supports the proposed limiting of the right of the veto — prior to abolishing it — to decisions relating to issues provided for under Chapter VII of the Charter. This year the international community will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We have always regarded the Declaration as a great achievement of the world?s peoples in their long struggle for fundamental rights, the most important of which are the right to live in peace, independence, prosperity and happiness, and with social justice, and the right to self-determination. It is unfortunate that the issue of human rights has sometimes been twisted to serve as a pretext for intervening and interfering in other countries? affairs. In this regard, Viet Nam greatly appreciates the position the Non-Aligned Movement expressed in the Durban Declaration, during its recent twelfth summit meeting, that human rights should not “be used as a political instrument for interference in internal affairs. ... They require an environment of peace and development, respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of States. Socio-economic rights, including the right to development, are inextricably part of real human rights.” Having suffered humiliation under foreign domination, having been ridiculed and having sacrificed innumerable lives in order to regain their human rights and dignity, our people will spare no effort to hold on to the fundamental rights they have regained. To achieve the objective of becoming a prosperous people, a strong State and a just and developed society, the Vietnamese people are, and will remain, resolved to pursue their policy of renewal and to industrialize and modernize the country. To do this and promote peace, cooperation and development, Viet Nam will continue to pursue its foreign policy in support of independence, sovereignty, openness, multilateralism, diversification of foreign relations, and gradual global and regional integration. Thus Viet Nam will always be an active member of international and regional organizations. It will continue to contribute to the United Nations efforts for peace and development, particularly in its capacity as a newly elected member of the Economic and Social Council. Humanity enters the new millennium with earnest hopes for a better and more prosperous life. At this historic turning point, we expect the United Nations to make greater efforts to achieve lasting peace and a climate of international cooperation supportive of the development of every nation. Viet Nam will spare no effort to contribute fully to the achievement of that lofty goal.   At the outset, Mr. President, let me extend to you Sri Lanka’s warmest congratulations on your well-deserved election. We wish you well and have no doubt that you will guide the work of this session with wisdom, skill and commitment. The Assembly owes a debt of gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko for his wise and astute leadership as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session. 22 This year Sri Lanka celebrates the golden jubilee of its independence. We reclaimed our freedom in 1948, ending nearly five centuries of colonial domination. We have given shelter within our land to all the great religions of the world: Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Christianity. We are a multiethnic and multicultural society. We are deeply committed to the democratic way of life. Our people have exercised universal adult franchise since 1931. We have a parliamentary system of government, with elections held regularly, where voter participation is uniquely high — as much as 80 per cent on average. We have an independent judiciary and free media. The rule of law is observed and respected. Fundamental rights are guaranteed and rendered justiciable. We are constantly alert to the protection of human rights, even in the face of grave provocation from some lawless elements that are bent on destroying our democratic society. Shortly after the achievement of its independence, Sri Lanka became a member of the United Nations. In the preamble to the Charter, the founding fathers expressed their determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. They reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights. They pledged to establish an environment in which international law and treaty obligations would be observed, and to promote the economic and social progress of all peoples. The United Nations has succeeded in keeping its basic promise of saving the world from the holocaust of a global conflict. But more than 50 years after the Charter was written, we cannot conclude that the world today is a safer place than it was when the United Nations was founded. Global nuclear disarmament remains a distant dream. Nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction have proliferated with no concern for the safety of humankind despite the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Members of the nuclear club that possess these weapons show no inclination to dismantle them even though the cold war has ended and conflicts between States have lessened. The United Nations has the responsibility to redouble its efforts to achieve global disarmament. That is a duty we owe to mankind, to unborn generations. We do not accept the thesis that these weapons are safe in the hands of some. The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has been demanding for a long time that the Conference on Disarmament should establish, as its highest priority, a committee to commence negotiations on a programme for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons within a time bound framework. In 1976 my mother, Mrs. Sirimavo R. D. Bandaranaike, addressing the Assembly as Prime Minister of Sri Lanka and chairperson of the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries, spoke of disarmament in the following words: “General and complete disarmament has been a declared objective of the United Nations and of the international community for nearly three decades. “Despite many initiatives taken by this Organization ... the world has witnessed not even the semblance of disarmament but a race for supremacy in destructive power, based on the myth that peace can be preserved only by strident and single-minded preparations for war and the refinement and sophistication of its techniques. It is, indeed, a sad reflection on the moral and intellectual standards of the twentieth century and of its values and priorities that so much of the world’s resources, which might have been devoted to the eradication of poverty, ignorance, disease and hunger, are being [wasted on] the production of monstrous weapons ... “[We] do not accept the thesis that disarmament is the special preserve of Powers that possess the paraphernalia of war. Every nation and every individual has a right to peace, and just as peace is indivisible so is the responsibility for its preservation. Hence the call of the non-aligned nations for a special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament and agreement for a world conference.” (A/31/PV.11, paras. 37-39) At the recently concluded Non-Aligned Movement Summit, held in South Africa under the chairmanship of President Nelson Mandela, the Movement once again expressed its preoccupation with the issue of global nuclear disarmament. In the years ahead the clamour for disarmament among the great majority of nations will grow in volume. The Non-Aligned Movement has consistently called for the Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament to establish, as the highest priority, an ad hoc committee to commence negotiations on a programme for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework. In addition, there is also a proposal for a nuclear weapons convention. We have to address these challenges as we approach the new millennium. The longer we shirk our responsibility, the greater the danger that looms ahead. 23 Today I have the honour and privilege of addressing the Assembly as the newly appointed chairperson of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which met in Colombo a few months ago. SAARC represents one fifth of humanity. South Asia is heir to a rich and complex plurality of cultural and religious traditions of great antiquity. Like any other association of sovereign States, we have our share of problems. But I wish to convey my confident belief that our summit meetings last year and this year have marked a turning point in the life of our association. Our leaders are aware of the awesome obligations that we jointly owe to the hundreds of millions of people who inhabit our region. We are determined to put aside the political differences that bedevil relations among some of us, in a common and united effort to improve the quality of life of our peoples. The message I bring from the Colombo Summit is that the prospects for enhanced economic, technological, social and scientific cooperation in our region are exceedingly bright. It is the will of our leaders, as vigorously manifested at the Colombo Summit. I am deeply indebted to my fellow Heads of State and Government for their invaluable advice and cooperation, and especially to the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan for the magnificent spirit of friendship and understanding they showed for the collective regional interests and concerns. SAARC too, like the Non-Aligned Movement, recognizes that the twin currents of globalization and liberalization which are swirling around us contain both the potential for prosperity as well as the seed of a dangerous new process of uneven development. It must be remembered that developing countries need special consideration in regard to the problems they face in globalizing their economies. However, what is abundantly clear is that not a single State, not even the most powerful, can hope to remain immune from economic disease and contagion. Ripples have spread widely from the economic upheavals of East Asia and Russia. The maladies that spring from economic globalization require remedies which are global in scope, remedies which must take account of the ailments of all States and not be based solely on the prescriptions advanced by those who may seem to be secure. United Nations bodies must play a critical role in all this, particularly by facilitating and fostering international cooperation for equitable development that could resist the economic contagion that now afflicts us. The international monetary mechanism has proved desperately inadequate in handling the recent crises. We now have to think in terms of a new financial architecture to obtain radical reforms of the international monetary system. This should aim at achieving a balance between the adjustments demanded as against available financing. I wish to propose three areas of action that merit serious consideration: first, that a “lender of last resort” facility must be formulated to meet the problems of volatile capital movements; secondly, that effective international surveillance devices must be designed to anticipate problems before the demolition squads of speculators move in; and thirdly, that the resumption of the Special Drawing Rights of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) be a vital requirement of the proposed restructuring. The major voting Powers of the IMF, as well as the developing nations, will have to consider larger allocations than are now contemplated. In the meantime, we should beware of attempts to liberalize capital accounts before the modernization of national financial structures and the reforms of the international monetary system are in place. A constructive dialogue between developed and developing countries must be pursued on the basis of mutual benefit and shared responsibilities. Closer consultation should be promoted between groups like the Group of 7, the G-77 and the G-15. Institutions such as the World Trade Organization must live up to their declared aims and genuinely facilitate a transparent, rule-based trading system that would permit stable growth. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) should not be neglected. It should be strengthened as the focal point in the United Nations family for the integrated consideration of issues of trade, finance, technology and investment. More funds for development activity need to be diverted from the United Nations administrative budget. The United Nations Agenda for Development, which was launched with great expectations, seems to be losing momentum. Its implementation should not be delayed. Development is not merely a matter of economic growth and financial enrichment, to be measured in statistics, which can sometimes be misleading and illusory. The totality of the human condition must be enhanced and improved. Our commitment and 24 responsibility towards economic and social development should not be minimized and made secondary to other issues which, though important, do not touch on the well- being of humanity. It is a grievous indictment on us that the age-old problems of grinding poverty and starvation still exist in today’s world. I appeal to the assembled nations not to allow ourselves to be beguiled or dazzled by the explosion of exciting new technologies, the seductive blandishments of global trade and high finance to the extent that the poor, the deprived, the desperate fall away from our agenda into the limbo of forgotten things. We must not forget that the least developed countries have special problems that cry out for attention. We must strive mightily, relentlessly, to banish these problems in the next century. The G-77 has proposed that a third world summit be held in the year 2000 to mark the dawn of the new century. Sri Lanka supports the proposal as an opportunity for developing countries to chart their own agenda for development in the new era. The countries of SAARC agreed at Colombo that to complement economic progress, a Social Charter should be drawn up for the benefit of our peoples in South Asia. This would focus on determining practical, basic norms in the areas of poverty eradication, the empowerment of women, the mobilization of youth, the promotion of health and nutrition, and the protection of children. We must make a special effort to dissipate the effects of the discriminatory, social and psychological perceptions that affect the status of women. The SAARC heads of State or Government condemned violence against women as well as acts of discrimination and humiliation which further depress the dignity of women. There was particular concern over the plight of women and girl children caught in situations of armed conflict. In Colombo, the SAARC States finalized the draft text of a regional convention on combating the crime of trafficking in women and children for prostitution, which will be signed at the next summit in Nepal. Within Sri Lanka, my Government has adopted a national plan of action based on the relevant conclusions of the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, and on the specifics of our own national situation. The Constitution of Sri Lanka enshrines the fundamental right of equality between the sexes. We have ratified International Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions guaranteeing equal remuneration and other benefits to women. We have strengthened legal provisions against harassment and sexual abuse of women. With regard to children, my Government has recently passed legislation to set up a National Child Protection Authority directly under my supervision. This Authority deals with such issues as child employment, the sexual exploitation of children, education, health and the plight of children trapped in armed conflict. We have formulated a “Children’s Charter” and a National Plan of Action to provide for the safety and protection of our children. While we are conscious of the tragic incidence of child prostitution and pornography in our country, we have also traced the insidious international linkages which aggravate the problem further. We urge the international community to tighten laws and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that those responsible for such heinous crimes will not receive refuge anywhere. A particularly cruel offence against the innocence of children is their forced recruitment by a terrorist group in Sri Lanka to serve as suicide killers in the name of a cause they are too young even to comprehend. This is just one sordid aspect of the activities of a terrorist group known as the Tamil Tigers — or the LTTE. They seek to dismember Sri Lanka, with the objective of creating in our land a monoethnic and racist entity — an objective totally unacceptable to the overwhelming majority in the country and even to the very community whose cause the LTTE claims to represent. We believe that ethnic grievances exist in Sri Lanka. I said so in my address to the nation at the fiftieth anniversary celebrations of our independence this year. I said that the golden jubilee of independence was an occasion for reflection, as well as the renewal of hopes and aspirations. It was an occasion to savour applause for our achievements and also to rue the consequences of failure. I said: “We must also with humility examine our failures. We have failed in the essential task of nation- building. We have meandered and faltered along that path, whilst among our neighbours in Asia and in many other countries, peoples of various racial, religious and linguistic communities live in harmony. The causes of this failure will be judged by history. Others will apportion and assign blame. 25 “Let us, those of us who have undertaken the responsibility to guide and govern the Nation, march towards the future in unison, putting behind us mean desires for petty personal or political gain. The Nation’s need today is so great and urgent that it permits space only for largesse of heart and mind, which will supersede in the national interest all that is irrelevant and small.” My Government is firmly committed to redressing ethnic grievances peacefully through political discussion. We have presented a comprehensive proposal for addressing the ethnic grievances through a wide devolution of political power. The vast majority of our people, of all communities, have welcomed these proposals. Only the LTTE chooses to prowl the path of violence, resorting to terror to achieve goals which it alone espouses. However, we have kept the doors open to the LTTE to join other Sri Lankans in negotiating a settlement of all outstanding ethnic issues if it eschews terrorism and its bloody call for a separate State. The LTTE claims to be a “liberation organization” while it murders hundreds upon hundreds of the Tamil people it claims to liberate when they disagree with the LTTE’s terror politics. Several Tamil leaders of democratic political parties, including members of parliament and two mayors, as well as Tamil human rights activists, have been brutally murdered by the LTTE. Its claim to be a “liberation organization” is negated by its unilateral resort to violence and its constant refusal to put its claims to the true test — that of participating in an open, democratic, peaceful process of consultation with the people. By contrast, in Palestine, Chairman Arafat pursues what he calls “the peace of the brave”, confident not only of the justice of his cause, but also of the strength of support freely given by the Palestinian people to achieve their inalienable right in Palestine. During the SAARC summit, we expressed growing concern at numerous setbacks affecting the peace process in the Middle East, including illegal attempts to change the jurisdiction and the borders of Jerusalem. Over the past few years the Government of Sri Lanka has in various international forums strongly advocated the need for collective international action in order to overcome the scourge of terrorism. Our reasoning has been that a group like the ruthless LTTE, which continues to frustrate every effort at finding a negotiated political settlement to our ethnic problem, has found sustenance in the liberal asylum policies that prevail in some countries. This group, which recruits children as young as 10 years, indiscriminately targets innocent civilians, assassinates the elected representatives of the people, including Tamil political and human rights leaders, destroys places of religious worship and assassinates foreign heads of Government on their soil, is permitted to operate freely in many countries. It maintains an international network which engages in fund-raising, narcotics trafficking, trade in illicit arms, the smuggling of illegal immigrants and, in more recent times, maritime and cyber-terrorism. Addressing the United Nations fiftieth anniversary celebrations in New York three years ago, I observed: “Concerted international action is essential to combat terrorism and to compel the terrorists to renounce violence and enter the democratic process. Unfortunately, effective action to that end has been frustrated through sterile philosophical debate about the nature of terrorism.” (A/50/PV.35, p. 9) I am happy to note that since then significant measures have been taken. The adoption of the United Nations International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings earlier this year has been a considerable moral victory for the international community in its fight against terrorism. Sri Lanka is hopeful that all States will speedily take steps to implement the necessary domestic legislation, aimed at giving effect to the commitments made in the Convention, to ensure that terrorists are neither provided safe haven nor permitted to raise funds within the borders of one State to sustain terrorist activities in another State. While we enact legislation, we must also be eternally vigilant to ensure that terrorists do not find loopholes in our laws to circumvent the emerging international consensus against terrorism. We are particularly conscious of the capacity of terrorist groups to resort to the strategy of using front organizations for raising funds which end up in the LTTE war chest to contribute towards murdering and brutalizing our people. Moral and legal sanctions against terrorists are not enough. Laws must be effectively implemented. Only by such concerted action shall we be able to ensure that terrorists are compelled to renounce violence and enter the democratic process. Here I would like to thank India and the United States of America, in particular, for having recognized and declared the LTTE to be the terrorist organization that it is, as well as for encouraging my Government to settle this problem by political means. I would like to add 26 here that this is an internal problem that Sri Lanka is fully able and ready to resolve, with the full support of its peoples. We will not tolerate any outside interference, while we appreciate all the support given us by our friends abroad in resolving this conflict. If at this stage I mention Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar it is because I am personally aware of the loneliness, the anguish, the difficulties and dangers that a woman leader faces in political life. The people of Sri Lanka and the people of Myanmar and their Governments have been friends over many centuries. Our peoples share an invaluable heritage — the timeless message of the Buddha, the enlightened one who taught the world the meaning of compassion, tolerance and understanding. This message moves me to express the hope that political issues in Myanmar may be approached in a spirit of conciliation and tolerance. In all this, a catalytic role can and must be played by the United Nations system. The United Nations has passed its half-century mark. The Secretary-General has described the United Nations as “a noble experiment in human cooperation”. Last year was designated the year of United Nations reform, and we are happy that a major portion of the reforms introduced have been implemented. Some others require further study. We are aware of the financial crisis the United Nations is facing due to the default of certain Member States in paying their contributions. We urge them to pay their dues fully, without conditions and on time. We are disappointed that agreement has not been reached over the reconstitution of the Security Council to reflect better the generality of United Nations membership. The Council should be more representative, and its deliberations more transparent and democratic, thus responding to the concerns of all and shedding its image, not entirely inaccurate, of largely serving the interests of the major Powers. In the closing years of the present millennium, the world is a far more complex place than it was when the United Nations Charter was adopted. The range and ramifications of the issues with which the Organization must contend have dramatically increased. Change in the orientation of the United Nations must keep pace with new realities. The Secretary-General’s Programme for Reform is a step in the right direction. Yet nothing will contribute more to the success of the United Nations than the extent of Member States’ commitment to the Organization’s decisions. The credibility and strength of those decisions will itself depend on the transparency of the decision- making process and on how closely Member States identify with those decisions. If the United Nations is to continue on its voyage into the twenty-first century with renewed vigour, to achieve its objectives of peace, security, economic development and social reform, all its Members must be empowered to participate meaningfully and at every level of the decision-making process. To this end, two important reforms must be placed on our agenda. First, the enlargement of the Security Council so that it will more fully represent two thirds of the world populace is an indispensable requirement. The developing nations and the regions of the world in which they predominate must have permanent representation on the Security Council. Secondly, the crucial role of the General Assembly in the decision-making process of the United Nations must be recognized and guaranteed. The United Nations General Assembly is the supreme parliament of mankind. Today the era of the cold war is over. Economic globalization is breaking down national boundaries to an extent that would have been unimaginable a few decades ago. The world is truly on the threshold of a new order which surely cannot be driven any more by the narrow national concerns that have paralysed the imagination of mankind for so long. Never before in human history have we been presented with the stupendous possibilities that surround us today of breaking the mundane bonds that bind us to banality and triviality. When the unconquered, unconquerable spirit of mankind is allowed to soar to its full potential we will achieve a world in which truth and justice prevail, a world which we can proudly bequeath to the unborn generations of our peoples. Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, my late father, addressing this Assembly at its eleventh session, in 1956, spoke as follows: “In an Organization such as this, the service that a country can render ... is not to be measured alone by the size of that country, its population, its power or its strength. This is an Organization which expresses itself most effectively by bringing to bear a certain moral force — the collective moral force and decency of human beings. That is a task in which the weak as well as the strong can render a useful service, and I give the Assembly the assurance, on behalf of my country, that as far as we are 27 concerned, every endeavour that we can make in all sincerity to assist in the achievements of those noble ideals for which this Organization stands will always be forthcoming in the fullest measure.” (A/PV.590, para. 42) Addressing this Assembly 42 years later, I make bold to say that Sri Lanka remains a loyal and dedicated Member of this Organization. We have made a contribution to the quality of its deliberations and to the implementation of its programmes. We are deeply committed to the principles of the Charter. We believe in the United Nations. We want it to be a strong, principled and effective body, the common inheritance of all mankind, not the preserve of a few wealthy and powerful States, but the guardian of all, especially the poor, the weak and the defenceless.  I wish to join those who have spoken before me in congratulating Mr. Didier Opertti on his election to the presidency of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. His vast experience and skill assure us that he will guide the deliberations of the Assembly to a successful end. I assure him of the full support of my delegation as he carries out his important mandate. Let me also take this opportunity to pay tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for his outstanding leadership during his tenure last session. The Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, deserves appreciation for his commendable efforts and for the effective leadership he has provided to ensure the realization of the ideals of our Organization by making the United Nations more effective and better able to serve its Members. The end of the cold war, even if only briefly, raised hopes and expectations and sent tidings of a more peaceful, safer, just and fair world safeguarded from conflict and tension, hunger and disease. Such hopes and expectations were to be frustrated rather early as the world was plunged in numerous conflicts between and with States, ethnic violence and hatred, terrorism, gross violations of human rights, racism and xenophobia, as well as mass starvation and an increase in the number of refugees and displaced persons. The international community cannot dismiss or, much less, ignore this situation, which in some cases has caused the commission of serious international crimes, not only because it is generally the innocent and the weak — women, children and the elderly — who are the first victims, but also because this situation, which now seems to be limited to certain regions, may soon engulf wider areas of the world. In the face of these harsh realities, it is incumbent on the United Nations and the international community to search for fresh, innovative approaches with a view to eliminating the root causes of this situation, in order to ensure respect for the basic principles of the Charter, to save the innocent from the scourge of terrorism and to protect the human and civil rights of ethnic minorities. If they fail to do so, it will not only prolong the agony of the victims but will, in fact, sooner or later, threaten regional as well as international peace and security. The founding fathers of our Organization recognized economic development as one of humanity’s inalienable rights, and set as one of the goals of the United Nations the promotion of social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. I am certain that all developing countries would declare in no uncertain terms that this goal has so far been unattained. The situation in Africa is cause for serious concern. In spite of the great efforts exerted by regional and subregional organizations and agencies, the situation in many parts of the continent is deteriorating and becoming more dangerous by the day. The tragic bloodshed and suffering that Africans have witnessed in the recent past in various parts of the continent are too horrible to recite. They must not recur and, where they continue to exist, they must be stopped. In the Great Lakes region, conflicts are developing much wider ramifications, in spite of their seeming regional containment. They pose a grave threat to peace and security, as they may soon involve extraregional Powers. It is hoped that through ongoing regional initiatives it will be possible to formulate just and mutually acceptable solutions. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Africans and the rest of the world have been forced to witness the disheartening spectacle of an 22 African country which had barely emerged from the cruel destruction of a rapacious dictatorship being once again ravaged by multifaceted fighting. This has also divided the broad African coalition which had contributed to the promotion of peace and security in that country. This sad state of affairs must be quickly reversed on the basis of full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and a recognition that the internal political process is the sole prerogative of the Congolese people, and with awareness of the need for a regional framework of cooperation to address the security concerns of the countries of the region. Somalia and the Sudan continue to be sources of anguish and sorrow for Africa, because there is still a lack of progress in the efforts to resolve the crises in both countries. The frustration of the international community at the lack of progress in peacemaking in both countries is understandable. It must be noted, however, that genuine efforts continue to be made by the countries of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), and the international community must not despair or give up, but must contribute to the efforts of these countries if they are to be successful. In this connection, my delegation upholds the view that with regard to the Sudan conflict IGAD’s Declaration of Principles and consequent resolutions remain the sound basis for a just and lasting solution to the conflict. In my statement last year I declared that Eritrea’s foreign policy rested on two basic tenets. The first was the deep conviction that where there is goodwill all disputes can be resolved through peaceful negotiations and methods without recourse to violence. The second tenet was the unswerving devotion of Eritrea to justice and equality. I also declared that these two tenets have influenced our search for friendship and cooperation with our neighbours, as well as with other States. This statement is as valid today as it was last year. The commitment of the Government of Eritrea to these two tenets has helped to defuse conflict with the Republic of Yemen and to arrive at a mutual understanding to resolve the dispute over the Eritrean archipelago of Hanish-Zukar in the Red Sea by peaceful means through arbitration. Today, too, the Government of Eritrea insists that the road to peace with Ethiopia is by a strict application and enforcement of the principles of the Charters of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU), as well as the OAU decision on colonial borders. Once again, Eritrea calls upon the international community, particularly the United Nations and the OAU, to ensure respect for these principles and the decision. Eritrea was surprised and disturbed by the eruption of conflict with Ethiopia because, in spite of disagreements on the issue of boundaries, dating back to the days of armed struggle the Eritrean Government had assumed and hoped that in view of the close relations between the two countries, it was possible to arrive at an amicable and enduring solution. The responsibility for the escalation of the dispute rests solely with the Government of Ethiopia, which has for a long period of time consistently violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Eritrea, resulting in the occupation of large tracts of Eritrean territory, followed by the forced displacement of Eritrean peasants and the replacement of Eritrean administrative structures by Ethiopian institutions. It reached a climax on 6 May only as a result of the further unprovoked incursions by members of the Ethiopian armed forces, which attacked Eritrean troops in the Badme region, in south-western Eritrea. These incursions were premeditated and meticulously planned. This is the root cause of the dispute. For a long time Eritreans had opted for patient and quiet diplomacy. They had hoped against hope that the periodic incursions were only the petty acts of some miscreant and ill-advised regional officials. It was only at a very late stage — and particularly after the publication in 1997 of an official map of the Tigray administrative zone incorporating additional indisputably Eritrean territory and after the issuance of the new Ethiopian currency note depicting the same map — that they realized the full meaning of the Ethiopian adventure. Yet, even in the aftermath of the fighting that was triggered by the unprovoked Ethiopian incursion and attacks on Eritrean troops, Eritrea never crossed its internationally recognized border; but Ethiopia still controls other Eritrean territory in south-western Eritrea. In spite of all this evidence of its aggressive deeds, the Ethiopian Government is conducting an absurd propaganda campaign to portray Eritrea as a warmongering nation which has committed aggression against, and occupies, Ethiopian territory. Nothing could be further from the truth. At no time have Eritrean troops crossed Eritrea’s internationally recognized borders as everybody can see. On the contrary, it was Ethiopian troops that invaded Eritrea after Prime Minister Meles 23 Zenawi’s declaration of war on 13 May 1998. They were repulsed. It is important to note that the Deputy Foreign Minister of Ethiopia, Dr. Tekeda Alemu, had articulated Ethiopia’s expansionist designs by publicly declaring in a speech to members of the Ethiopian community in the United States that Ethiopia would occupy the Eritrean port of Assab within a short time. In the light of the above, Ethiopia’s claims that it is the victim of aggression and will not negotiate unless Eritrea withdraws from “its territory” are obviously false and only meant to hoodwink the international community and to cover up its own acts of aggression. Even today, Ethiopia is threatening war unless Eritrea withdraws unconditionally from territories which are fully within its internationally recognized borders. Today virtually the whole of the Ethiopian army has taken positions along the Eritrean border, and almost all of the highest leaders of Ethiopia, including the President, the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, the President of the Tigray region and a Senior Official of the TPLF have publicly declared in just the past few days that Ethiopia has finalized war preparations and will soon teach Eritreans lessons they will never forget. It is regrettable, therefore, that all the goodwill and efforts of the Eritrean Government, consisting of several constructive proposals, to bring about a peaceful and legal settlement of the present border dispute with Ethiopia, on the basis of the OAU resolution on colonial borders, have been consistently rejected by the Ethiopian Government, which obdurately pursues a policy which is committed to the settlement of matters by military means. The Ethiopian Government has also rejected all overtures by third parties for a peaceful solution of the dispute and all calls made by the international community to seek a peaceful solution. This expansionist and aggressive policy is underscored by the use or threat of force, as well as a massive and malicious propaganda campaign against Eritrea. The propaganda campaign accents ethnic hatred and vituperation against and slander of the Eritrean people and members of the Eritrean Government. It also calls upon the Eritrean people to rise up against their Government. At the same time, the Ethiopian Government has been systematically and wilfully violating the most sacred and cherished provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the two International Covenants and several other international human rights instruments, as well as the principles enshrined in the United Nations and OAU Charters, by deporting or expelling more than 20,000 Eritreans and Ethiopians of Eritrean origin under extremely unhealthy conditions or dumping them in very dangerous places, and by deliberately separating family members, exposing them to inhuman, cruel and degrading treatment and confiscating their property. These acts have been well documented by third parties, including members of United Nations agencies, heads of mission of member States of the European Union and several non- governmental organizations. Yet the Ethiopian Government, in an amazingly refined application of the Orwellian principle, accuses the Eritrean Government of precisely the outrages and atrocities it itself has been committing against Eritreans and Ethiopians of Eritrean origin. The truth is that the Eritrean Government has not detained, expelled, deported or otherwise violated the rights — human or otherwise — of Ethiopians living in Eritrea. This has been verified by legitimate third parties like representatives of the European Union, United Nations agencies and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). As usual, the Ethiopian Government has called all of them liars. We have hitherto extended an invitation to all interested parties to carry out an on-the-spot verification of the human rights conditions in both Eritrea and Ethiopia. We now extend this invitation to members of the Assembly. We also would like them to receive a similar invitation from the Ethiopian Government. This dispute is about borders, pure and simple. Any effort to transmute it into anything else must be viewed as only a vain and brazen attempt by the Ethiopian Government to camouflage its aggression and its expansionist policies. In this connection, it must be made clear that it was the Ethiopian Government which wilfully violated Eritrea’s colonial boundaries and forcefully occupied those areas that it had incorporated into its new map of Tigray. It was the Ethiopian Government which subverted all Eritrean efforts to defuse the crisis and to find a peaceful bilateral solution through their Joint Border Commission by unleashing unprovoked military attacks on Eritrea from 6 to 12 May. It was the Ethiopian Government which declared war on Eritrea by a resolution of its Parliament on 13 May. It was the Government of Ethiopia which invaded Eritrea along several points on their common border. It was the Government of Ethiopia which launched an air strike on Asmara, the Eritrean capital, on 5 June 1998. It was the Ethiopian Government which imposed an air and sea blockade by threatening indiscriminate air bombing of Eritrea. 24 Yet Ethiopia has falsely portrayed Eritrea as an aggressor country by claiming that Eritrean forces invaded Ethiopian territory on 12 May. However, it is not claims and counter-claims that matter. There is incontrovertible material evidence which establishes that Ethiopia has deliberately used force and carried out military incursions in Eritrea since July 1997 with a view to covertly changing the reality on the ground. In this connection, I wish to bring to the Assembly’s attention that the Eritrean Government has repeatedly called for an independent investigation of the incidents that triggered the conflict. This border dispute should not have existed in the first place, considering that boundaries between the two States are some of the most clearly defined in Africa and were made by explicit and detailed provisions of international treaties. They were then confirmed by the United Nations when it created the ill-fated Eritrean-Ethiopian federation, and again clearly defined in the Constitution that the United Nations gave to Eritrea. True, the borders may not have been demarcated; but they are not the only undemarcated borders in Africa, and the non-demarcation of boundaries has not prevented most African — and indeed other — States from living in peace with their neighbours and from solving their problems peacefully. Eritrea is committed to a peaceful and legal solution of this dispute on the basis of the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of States which are enshrined in the charters of both the United Nations and the OAU as well as the decisions and declarations of the OAU and the Non- Aligned Movement. Since before the onset of the crisis, Eritrea has been attempting to initiate numerous bilateral discussions with Ethiopia with a view to addressing all outstanding issues related to their common borders. In this connection, the following must be mentioned. First, the Eritrean Cabinet and National Assembly issued orders, on 14 and 20 May 1998 and again on 18 June 1998, respectively, for the temporary demilitarization of the areas of dispute. Secondly, the Eritrean President sent two letters to the Prime Minister of Ethiopia requesting him to join him in defusing the dispute and settling the border issue peacefully and legally on a bilateral basis. Thirdly, the Eritrean Government presented to the OAU Committee of Ambassadors a proposal containing the principles of respect of colonial boundaries and non- violation of these borders; respect of the charters of the OAU and the United Nations; commitment not to use force to impose a solution; commitment to peaceful and legal means to solve the dispute; readiness to stop all hostilities; and readiness to enter into direct talks without preconditions. Unfortunately, all our efforts failed because of negative responses from Ethiopia. On the other hand, Ethiopia has yet to offer a single plan or peace proposal. It has only threatened war unless Eritrea withdraws from territories which are within the internationally recognized borders of Eritrea. In this connection, it must be mentioned that the Eritrean Government has time and again requested the Ethiopian Government to publicly announce to the peoples of Eritrea, Ethiopia and the international community the territories that it claims and to designate them on a political map with clear geographical coordinates. It is for these reasons that the Government of Eritrea yet again offers the following as a basis for the solution of the dispute. First, the comprehensive solution of the problem through a technical demarcation on the basis of the established colonial treaties that clearly define the boundary between the two countries. Secondly, a possible resort to arbitration on the basis of the sanctity of colonial borders in the event that this is demanded by the other party. Pending a lasting, legal solution, an immediate cessation of all hostilities and a ceasefire to be monitored by an observer force under the auspices of the United Nations. It is a matter of satisfaction to the people and Government of Eritrea that numerous governmental institutions, international and regional organizations and non-governmental organizations, including the House of Representatives of the United States Congress, the European Union and the Non-Aligned Movement, have, in welcoming the Eritrean initiative, called upon both Eritrea and Ethiopia to avoid the use of force at all costs and to resolve their disputes peacefully. I wish to declare here and now, in loud and clear terms, that the Government of Eritrea welcomes, and is ready to undertake to implement, a decision by the Assembly which provides without any preconditions for the cessation of hostilities, a ceasefire agreement and a 25 peaceful resolution of the dispute by any method as the only acceptable solution. In Africa, conflicts such as the present Eritrean- Ethiopian border dispute have taken place several times in the past. Each one of these conflicts was addressed on the basis of the hallowed principles and decisions of the OAU, including in particular respect for colonial borders, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and the non- use of force or threat of force. As the OAU prepares itself to enter the twenty-first century, it is imperative that its member States rededicate themselves to the sublime principles and resolutions that have hitherto served our continent. These principles and decisions, which have successfully fostered peace and stability, solved conflicts and defused tension in our continent in the past, will be as valid in the future as they have been since they were first articulated. Only through their proper application will it be possible to defuse tension and eliminate conflict. Eritrea reiterates its commitment to peace, harmony and the rule of law in international relations, however painful this tragedy may be. Eritrea seeks peace for itself and for all of its neighbours. Eritrea will continue to seek good relations with all its neighbours. Eritrea is in a race against the clock of development and cannot afford to lose the time, energy and resources which must be used in the war against underdevelopment. To date, Eritrea has restrained itself against extreme provocation, and it will continue to do so unless it is forced to defend itself. If aggression is committed against their country, however, Eritreans will have no choice but to defend their hard-won independence and sovereignty as well as every inch of their territory with whatever is at their disposal.I bring to you, Sir, and to all the representatives to this General Assembly the warm greetings of the people of Djibouti. I extend to Mr. Opertti my sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. As the world grows smaller and the problems confronting us grow ever more challenging, the deliberations of humanity?s forum, the General Assembly, assume a critical urgency. His competence and broad experience will undoubtedly guide us very ably in the coming year. We are also most grateful to his predecessor, the former Foreign Minister of Ukraine, for bringing to bear a degree of focus and productivity that was exemplary. Through his exceptional grasp of the issues before the General Assembly, he was able to lead us to satisfactory results. Our indefatigable Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, continues to earn our deepest appreciation for the manner in which he has managed the activities of the Organization, especially for the way in which the United Nations has risen in the eyes of the general public. Demands on the United Nations have increased. Ever- changing economic, environmental, social and political problems have added to these demands. Core contributions to the funds and programmes continue to decline, however, and the United Nations faces unpredictable resource flows due to unpaid assessments. Recognizing that a radical transformation of the United Nations would cause political tensions, the Secretary-General wisely formulated a series of realistic reforms to rationalize operations, reduce costs and refocus on certain critical areas demanding United Nations attention, such as the mitigation of poverty, sustainable development and strengthening management and coordination, both at Headquarters and in field-level activities. We support the Secretary-General?s relentless efforts to communicate directly with and engage the people of the world, exploring critical issues and exchanging views with them, and explaining the role, capacities and constraints of the United Nations system. His work has given the United Nations a reality and a new face vital to its mission. In early August, a corner of our world, eastern Africa, was profoundly shocked, baffled and aggrieved by the well- coordinated simultaneous bombings of United States embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. Over 260 people lost their lives and thousands of innocent people were injured in those attacks. These brazen acts of aggression wrought unprecedented carnage and extensive destruction and damage to property. I recently visited Nairobi. What I saw resembled a war zone. I unreservedly condemn this senseless act of terrorism. Once again, I wish to express our heartfelt condolences to all the families who lost their loved ones in this tragedy and pray for the speedy recovery of the injured. May I also express our concern at the United States action against the Sudan. There are growing doubts about the justification for the raid that devastated the El Shifa pharmaceutical plant, which produced desperately needed medicines and drugs. Visiting there recently, I was struck by the extent of the damage. All that is left of the plant is a mountain of rubble. The onus lies now on the United States to produce fuller evidence to support its claim. We also urge the United Nations to undertake an independent investigation to determine whether this factory was indeed making chemical weapons, as alleged. It seems essential to remind ourselves that the annual session of the General Assembly has become the sole occasion for virtually all mankind, collectively, to appraise the human condition. Additionally, drawn as we are by the hypnotic spell of the approaching millennium, the need to assess our past successes, achievements and failures and to develop priorities and strategies for the future has assumed a sense of urgency. A little over 50 years ago, the world embarked with great vision, enthusiasm and optimism upon a high- minded journey to end the scourge of war, eliminate poverty and create a world of freedom and justice for all. Undoubtedly, much has been accomplished and the world is a far better place to live in, despite the fact that many dreams remain unfulfilled and many commitments unimplemented. This decade, in particular, has witnessed tendencies towards the fragmentation of societies, the spread of civil strife and conflict and a plunge further into the poverty trap. In general, we recognize that respect for human rights has improved and that many countries have embraced democracy and good governance, and we welcome that. Unfortunately, human rights violations continue, and there is a lingering concern about the capacity, resources and mandates of the United Nations for timely intervention in cases of egregious violations of human rights. We have had the bad experience of regrettable vacillation and indifference in the face of appalling crimes committed in Bosnia and Rwanda, and now in Kosovo. As the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has correctly stated, efforts to prevent the most abominable violence should focus not only on resolving ethnic and political disputes, but also on the social issues of chronic underdevelopment, grinding poverty, mass unemployment, widespread illiteracy and systematic inequalities of income or opportunities. We therefore welcome the establishment of the International Criminal Court, which replaces once and for all the ad hoc proceedings. It fills in the gap in international law exposed by the famous Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals: the need to install a permanent international institution able to investigate war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. Much of the technological advancement of the twentieth century has created a host of other problems. Man?s mastery over nature for his own benefit has 2 become a potential nightmare of environmental disasters, one which we seemingly lack the will to contain or correct. Will we continue to have land to farm, clean water to drink and healthy air to breath? Will our cities decay into piles of humans for whom day to day survival becomes the crowning achievement of their lives? Overpopulation, abject poverty, crime, drugs and the consequences they bring may soon threaten the foundations of social cohesion. To a great extent, these forces are transnational, extending beyond the capacity and control of individual States. They are global in nature and pose serious challenges to society and its leadership. We must act collectively in marshalling the resources necessary to mitigate the harmful effects of modernization and globalization. Unquestionably, the founding of the United Nations was one of the outstanding achievements of this century. After 50 years, we can take pride in the continuing relevance of this institution. Naturally, given the breadth and complexity of issues facing the United Nations and mankind, there will always be differences of views on the evolving role of the United Nations. However, the basic mission of the United Nations has not changed one iota: collective international action for maintenance of international peace and security and promotion of economic and social development for all. While the Charter remains relevant, the world of 1945 is no longer with us. The United Nations of today must embrace the realities of the new millennium. Anachronistic structures and outmoded thinking cannot coexist with current needs and perceptions. The phenomenal growth in the membership of the United Nations leads us to hope for a more democratic, transparent and representative Organization. This is the case in particular with regard to the Security Council, which must reconcile itself to undergoing a thorough transformation in both its structure and its functions in order to reflect a more equitable geographical representation of developing and developed countries. The sudden outbreak of hostilities between our neighbours, Ethiopia and Eritrea, has greatly dismayed us. As in the case of Somalia, Djibouti has attempted to reconcile the different points of view in various ways, although there are few real signs of hope for a way out of the stalemate. Beyond the tragic loss of lives, displacement of people and destruction of property and facilities, the psychological wounds inflicted by the tensions and hostilities that are dividing these countries suggest that it will be several difficult years before the Horn of Africa becomes once again a region of peace and trust. Both leaders understand my frustration — indeed, my exasperation — at this wasteful, unnecessary and seemingly endless conflict. We are confronted by serious regional problems and must revive economies that have been dormant for a long time. We need a new vision, new perspectives and a far-sighted approach to deal with bilateral differences. I urge my friends, the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea, to give peace a chance. Let us end the hostile propaganda and provocative rhetoric and replace it with a genuine desire to engage constructively in finding a solution to this problem. It would be a tragedy if the relentless shuttling between Addis Ababa and Asmara by leaders and senior officials of many Governments, including heads of regional organizations, who have all demonstrated immense goodwill and perseverance and expended time, energy and boundless effort in trying to resolve the conflict, were to be taken by some to be largely symbolic. We believe they are more than that. The series of attempts made by a great many mediators and facilitators demonstrates the seriousness of this matter. The many views, opinions, decisions and resolutions relating to this conflict, even if not wholly acceptable to one or both parties, nevertheless contain significant elements that can form the basis of a settlement. It is incumbent upon both leaders to go beyond the immediate unfortunate problem and to look forward resolutely to a better and promising future of benefit to all. In the words of the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations, I call upon the leaders of those countries “to practise tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours”. There is no doubt that the speed of globalization and the expansion and integration of the international economy have brought immense benefits to many countries and positive changes in the living condition of many people. However, several countries and their populations, particularly in the developing world, are facing marginalization and hopelessness because they are unable to adapt to the rapid pace of integration. The least developed countries in particular require special attention so that they do not slip further into the abyss of poverty and disintegration. The World Economic Survey 1997 shows that Africa will have to demonstrate still higher and more sustained rates of growth in order to alleviate widespread poverty 3 and reduce high unemployment. Improved and sustained macroeconomic stability and economic reforms have played important roles in Africa?s recent economic upturn, although the sacrifices have been great. But Africa must now grapple with the erroneous perception by developed countries that private investment flows can be a substitute for development assistance, which in fact largely bypasses the continent: only 5 per cent of such assistance goes to Africa as a whole, and only 1 per cent to sub-Saharan Africa. Add this to the crippling debt servicing costs and it becomes clear that Africa, and in particular the least developed of its countries, is in a precarious financial position. The danger of prolonged, or indefinite, marginalization is a real one. As the continent continues to be mired in a series of crises, the much vaunted policy of finding African solutions to African problems, which was among the precursors of Western disengagement, seems to be predicated on a number of premises that are tenuous at best. The fact is that Africa cannot succeed alone; it needs serious, resolute commitment to Africa?s economic recovery on the part of the industrial countries, along with a determination to prevent and resolve conflicts. It is important to note that African countries have played an important role in the efforts to maintain and restore peace in Liberia and in Sierra Leone. That is a positive development that we cannot fail to welcome. But we are saddened by the resurgence of hostilities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We warn all involved in the current crisis that pursuing individual military agendas in the Congo is not in the interest of the long-term stability of the region or of Africa as a whole. The territorial integrity of that country must be respected, and no country in the region or in any other region of Africa should try to place any of its neighbours under its thumb. Since 1991, at the time of Somalia?s implosion, Djibouti, both independently and through the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), has tirelessly sought to restore peace and security to that country. In 1991, we organized the first two national reconciliation conferences; then the United Nations began its extensive operations. Subsequently, Ethiopia, with a mandate from IGAD and the Organization of African Unity (OAU), organized a series of meetings that led to the Sodere agreement. Other countries, the League of Arab States, various Arab States and other organizations have also made serious reconciliation efforts during this period. Every year, new conferences were held and new agreements signed, none of which were implemented. This shows that the faction leaders had learned the technique of making people believe in a reconciliation that would last about as long as their return flights home. Since the United Nations departure and disengagement from Somalia in the mid-1990s, the international community has come to remember only a “failed operation” and a “failed State”. But that devastated country needs the United Nations to become engaged once again. Somalia deserves greater interest and attention than it now gets. This is not solely a regional or even an African or Arab problem; Somalia was and continues to be an international disaster. Its neighbours have made enough concessions, and they stand to sacrifice and risk even more. It is therefore fair to say that it is not easy or tolerable to continue living in a no-peace-no-war situation. Imagine having to life beside a neighbour without laws, without a government, without a central authority. After seven years of bickering, the faction leaders have nothing new to offer. Give the people of Somalia, with the support of the international community, a chance to elect leaders of their choice, by stages, both regionally and nationally — without threats and without blackmail. It is not impossible that the evolving new approach of setting up regional administrations or “mini-states” could enhance security and stability and shape the future political structure of Somalia, so long as they do not compromise the country?s unity. We are deeply saddened by the lack of progress under the peace agreements in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Israel is continuing to seize Palestinian property; engaging in relentless settlement activities in the West Bank; imposing intransigent rule over East Jerusalem; and illegally and unilaterally extending the boundaries of the municipality of Jerusalem. Israel?s arbitrary and coercive measures, which include the suspension of the Palestinians? rights to enter, work, trade, reside, remain, build or travel in the country, have created intolerable uncertainties and a difficult situation. We demand that Israel immediately withdraw its troops, put a stop to settlement and construction in the settlements, and desist from taking unilateral decisions that undermine the peace efforts, as called for by the Oslo peace accords. We are one with the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people to establish an independent State and to live side by side with Israel in peace and within secure borders. Above all, we hope that Israel will heed the call 4 by the international community to establish comprehensive peace in the Middle East on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978). The relentless fratricidal war in Afghanistan shows no sign of abating, despite intense and continuing international efforts. The people of Afghanistan have suffered immensely and are on the verge of losing all hope of any political solution to this crisis. In the last two years there has been an increase in violence, intolerance, and the abuse of human rights, in particular against women. We hope that the risk of tensions escalating as a result of the murder of Iranian diplomats will be defused through the ongoing initiatives of the Secretary-General. The international community has often turned to sanctions in order to combat violations of international law or to punish uncontrolled criminal behaviour. In practice, however, the application of sanctions is often too general and broad, serving particular political interests. Real targets or target groups are not affected, and it is the innocent population at large that suffers as a result of such blind embargoes. Once sanctions become personalized or are used to serve as weapons to serve and protect powerful interests, they cease to have time limits or clear indications as to when their requirements have been met. Their original purpose is lost and the sanctions assume a life of their own. The end result is a climate of frustration and non- compliance with a resultant considerable squandering of credibility. Without a sense of limits, purpose and fairness, the exercise then becomes futile and counter-productive. Behind the broad global problems facing our planet Earth, some of which I have mentioned briefly, lie specific areas and countries which merit particular attention. For example, there is universal concern about the economic and financial crisis assailing Asia and its implications for the rest of the world. It is difficult to comprehend that the Asian miracle we had all come to marvel at should collapse so abruptly, with grave consequences for Governments, businessmen and peoples. Many of the countries involved risk falling into severe recession. Whatever the explanation for this crisis, this experience proves that there are real perils in the free flow of international capital. The danger is incalculable, forcing serious revision of some of our long-term development plans. It is also disturbing to see so many of the resources of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) going towards rescuing large international banks and financial institutions that recklessly and of their own volition placed their funds in sectors where restraint and control were needed. Now we must all wonder who will be the next to suffer a flight of capital and who will help to bail them out. There is undoubtedly a strong case for creating a better mechanism to regulate international standards for financial management and capital flows. The task of engendering a national sense of identity and cohesion and shared values against a backdrop of turbulence and instability is one of the core challenges of nation-building. In Djibouti, we have had our ups and downs. We continue to face daunting economic difficulties, aggravated by the presence of a great number of refugees, which has overwhelmed our limited means and severely strained our social services. I am proud to say that Djibouti, despite these obstacles, has established itself as a nation, a responsible member of the international community. Since gaining independence over 20 years ago, we have effected a series of changes aimed at the attainment of better standards of living and have undertaken to found a culture of democracy and tolerance. The process of accelerated political and economic change continues, however fragile it may be. I believe in the concept that there should be opponents but not enemies. That is why tolerance, compassion and forbearance have guided my actions as leader of my country. We have pursued a policy of regional and ethnic inclusion, and have long recognized the concept of diversity in unity. Djibouti?s approach to regional affairs has always been based on mutual respect, moderation and cooperation. We believe that the countries of the Horn of Africa must unite to confront the problems of poverty, conflicts and underdevelopment within the framework of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development whose revitalization is crucial. At the international level, we credibly contributed to the maintenance of peace and security during our membership in the Security Council in 1993 and 1994. As an extension of this, we have participated in international peacekeeping missions to bring peace and stability to countries in the throes of conflict. In the context of the current global financial turmoil, one thing is certain: yesterday?s international institutions cannot cope with today?s intensity, magnitude and rapidity, which demand greater openness and transparency. Djibouti therefore joins in the overwhelming 5 call for a comprehensive overhaul of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank so that they can adequately respond to the financial calamity we are experiencing. They must also be fully equipped to mount a determined attack on poverty, growing hopelessness and underdevelopment. I pray that the new millennium will bring us more stability, understanding and harmony among nations, and among peoples within nations.  Before I deliver my statement, let me express on behalf of my country our heartfelt sympathy to the Governments and peoples of the Caribbean that have fallen victim to the devastating onslaught of Hurricane Georges. I hope that we all in the international community will extend to them comfort and humanitarian assistance with all deliberate speed. Let me add my voice to the other speakers in felicitating Mr. Opertti upon his unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. Namibia will readily lend him our full support and cooperation during his tenure of office. Our two countries â€” Uruguay and Namibia â€” have worked very closely together and with other friendly countries in bringing about the African-Latin American initiative, a necessary and timely innovation aimed at concretizing a mutually felt need for greater interaction between our two neighbouring continents. I wish him all the luck. Let me also take this opportunity to congratulate his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, former Foreign Minister of Ukraine, who so ably presided over the work of the General Assembly during a period in which the Organization took bold steps towards institutional transformation and in various social and technical fields. Not only did he prove his leadership qualities and diplomatic skills, but he also, and more importantly, sought to promote the important role of the General Assembly itself in the larger context of the maintenance of international peace and security, and particularly the preservation of human security. For small and developing countries like Namibia, the Assembly is where democracy comes alive as the worldâs biggest parliament. To the Secretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Kofi Annan, my delegation pledges its fullest support for his tireless efforts to provide effective leadership and practical ideas as we try to find workable solutions to the new challenges facing the global community. His annual report and the important statement he delivered yesterday provided inspiration and reassurance. I congratulate him for his vision and initiatives. Let me say a word or two about the United Nations reform process. We are two years away from the new millennium and, for some time now, we have all being addressing some of those challenges that lie ahead and how the United Nations can transform itself to more effectively respond to the needs and aspirations of its Members in the twenty-first century. The initial work of revitalization of the United Nations in the economic, social and development fields has been partially completed. Reform of the United Nations is an ongoing process and Namibia believes that an important lesson can be learnt from what has been achieved so far: no quick fixes, but also no indefinite negotiations. The management of the global economy is a top priority. Economic disparities and social backlogs in our societies must be mitigated. Africaâs position on the enlargement of the Security Council is on the table. It includes two permanent seats on the Council and additional non-permanent seats. Namibia also calls for the abolition of the veto power. We have done so before and I am repeating that call once again, for the veto negates the very idea of United Nations reform and democratization. Let me also say here that, while we take into account the purposes of the United Nations as stated in Article 1 of the Charter, it is also important that we take effective and collective measures to finance the United Nations. In this regard, Namibia urges all Member States to pay their contributions in full and on time and to clear their arrears in order to enable the Secretary-General to fully carry out the resolutions of the General Assembly and, indeed, also those of the Security Council. I wish to say a word or two about peace and development. In 1995, all the world leaders who converged on New York for the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations reiterated, in their different languages yet in unison, their common commitment to the highest virtues of human dignity, peace and security, sustainable development and prosperity for all. Three years later, it looks everywhere as if it is a question of business as usual. Much more needs to be done in the areas of poverty eradication, human resource development and gender equality, as well as transfer of technology and resources for development from the rich to the poor. 27 Wherever in this, our one world, economic disparity, social injustice, armed conflicts, political instability and indeed environmental degradation prevail, there can be no rewarding human existence, meaningful productivity to sustain life and civilization, nor lasting scientific and technological breakthroughs in the service of this and future generations. Todayâs very topical questions of democracy, human rights, good governance and globalization now seem to end up on the back burner of the global agenda. Other priorities always seem to enjoy more attention. Much needed resources are being driven more and more away towards greater benefits for the military-industrial enterprises of the rich and the powerful nations. The result is further impoverishment of the nations and peoples of the third world. Happily, we have been joined by two illustrious champions in a worthy human cause: Danny Glover, African-American actor activist, and Nadine Gordimer, South African Nobel laureate, who will, jointly and individually, articulate worldwide the plight of the forgotten masses in the third world, as the United Nations Development Programmeâs Goodwill Ambassadors. Both of them are my personal friends, and I congratulate them and heartily welcome them aboard. It has been said by a third world leader that: â€œWe live in an international jungle. There is no law and order in international relations. There is very little justice. The high and the mighty rule everywhere. The weak and the poor just have to lump it.â€ It is hardly possible to dispute this. With regard to issues of multilateral trade that are of concern to the developing countries, there is an imperative need for us to articulate a specific and constructive South agenda. The developing countries must develop a common position on, for example, whether there should be a new round of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations or whether a sectoral approach is preferable. These are our common concerns that the Group of 77 should be spearheading in WTO negotiations, as well as in the South- North dialogue. Globalization is here to stay. We welcome it. But it is not in itself a panacea for ensuring the peopleâs economic rights at home or a just world order, based on cooperation and equity. Globalization must be our thing collectively as members of the human family. When one section of the family prospers, the rest should be allowed to share in that bonanza. To condemn a section of the family to a perpetual state of marginalization would be inhuman and unkind. The heavy burden of external debt is denuding the resources and capacity of poor nations, mainly those in Africa. External debt cannot merely be reorganized. Debt write-off is the best and the most humane thing to do, under the present circumstances. Some major Western creditors have written off debt, others should follow. Bretton Woods institutions should rethink their insistence on bleeding conditionalities in terms of official capital flows and debt relief in favour of providing assistance towards stimulating economic growth and productivity that will help poverty eradication in the developing countries. In this connection, it is to be hoped that the recent meeting held in New York with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will be a harbinger of new and better things to come. The Group of 77, which is the task force for the member States of the Non-Aligned Movement, together with our many friends, must continue to work hard in order to hasten implementation of the Agenda 21 Programme of Action in its entirety. For globalization and liberalization to be carried out successfully in pursuit of our shared ideals of democratization, economic justice and human security, South-North dialogue should be open and constructive in the spirit of â€œsmartâ€ partnership, devoid of confrontation and blackmail. At the 1998 Southern African Development Community (SADC) Summit of Heads of State or Government, held at Grand Bay, Mauritius, on 13 and 14 September, the regional African leaders endorsed policy guidelines that will facilitate the speedy completion of SADCâs transformation into a dynamic development community. This exercise will be carried out on the basis of the review and rationalization of the SADC Programme of Action. The Summit reaffirmed the ongoing work on sectoral coordination by member States to ensure streamlining of sectors and increase regional integration and productivity. The member States were urged to expedite ratification of the trade protocol as a matter of the utmost priority. This will open up greater opportunities for regional economic cooperation and trade between them. Added to these actions that have already been taken or are being envisaged was the strong reiteration that all 28 SADC regional policies and activities must be carried out pursuant to the objectives and goals of the African Economic Community. The first significant step taken in this direction was the signing on 25 February 1998, in Addis Ababa, of the Protocol on The Relationship between the African Economic Community and the Regional Economic Communities. For 1999, the Summit set a theme for SADC: â€œSADC in the next Millennium: The Challenges and Opportunities of Information Technology.â€ That is the vision that seeks to promote the socio-economic empowerment of the people. Political and economic reforms that have started in Africa must stay on course and produce the results that our people want. Regarding regional conflicts, as other speakers have noted, the maintenance of international peace and security is constantly being threatened by ongoing as well as new regional conflicts. Lately, dastardly acts of terrorism and indiscriminate counter-attacks have become frequent happenings. In Europe, bloody confrontation and human suffering persist in Bosnia, Albania and Kosovo. In West and South Asia, a very explosive political, military and nuclear situation is fast developing into an undeclared state of war and a likely destabilization of that strategic region. We welcome the high-level and face-to-face meetings now taking place between some of the leaders from that region. Sadly, there is a serious situation of stalemate, reversals and prevarication in the Middle East, and the peace process has by now, to all intents and purposes, reached a precipitous dead end. Israel cannot hope to live in security if the universally accepted principle of land for peace is not scrupulously adhered to and implemented without delay. The legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent State of their own, cannot be sacrificed because of a single-minded insistence on security. An early agreement on a just, comprehensive and durable peace for the whole of the Middle East is the only viable guarantee for peace, stability, security and cooperation in the best interests of one and all. Namibia supports that approach and not the politics of confrontation and nullification. In our own SADC subregion, some of the old conflicts have gone from bad to worse and new ones have been ignited. In Angola, renewed military attacks and defiance of the demands of the United Nations and the rest of the international community by Mr. Savimbi and UNITA have derailed the peace process and delayed the finalization of the implementation of the remaining aspects of the 1994 Lusaka Protocol. The Security Council has reacted forcefully to UNITAâs non-compliance by imposing stringent sanctions on it and, once again, has demanded speedy and full implementation of the Lusaka Protocol. Furthermore, the last summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), held in Ouagadougou, was equally unsparing in its condemnation of Mr. Savimbi and UNITA for unceasing delaying tactics and political violence against innocent Angolans and the unsuspecting citizens of neighbouring States, including my own country, Namibia. The recently concluded SADC Summit resolved, among other things, that measures must be taken to ensure compliance by Mr. Savimbi and UNITA with the decisions that member States have made through SADC, the OAU and United Nations resolutions. The Summit further called on the international community, particularly countries and leaders who have an influence on Mr. Savimbi, to persuade the rebel movement to rededicate itself to the path of peace and reconstruction in Angola, as a matter of urgency. On another front, the Kingdom of Lesotho is once again teetering on the brink of serious destabilization and social disorder just because some politicians, who were defeated in the last general elections, have taken the law into their own hands. It has become an acute situation, which our regional leaders are urgently and jointly trying to resolve peacefully. Moreover, other misguided men, driven by a blind ambition and appetite for needless confrontation, have plunged the Democratic Republic of the Congo into a devastating war, which has resulted in inter-African fighting on the battlefield of that sister country. Namibia has joined the other SADC member States, at the express invitation of President Laurent Kabila and his legitimate Government, for the sole purpose of preventing the collapse of the State machinery and the violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a fellow SADC member State by the invading armies and their collaborators. Namibiaâs involvement is for peace, democracy, human rights and regional cooperation. The recent SADC Summit expressed itself on the situation, and it is important that I quote a few passages what it said, as follows: 29 â€œThe Summit expressed deep regret at the outbreak of war in DRC, as a result of attempts by rebels and their allies to forcefully remove the Government of President Kabila from power. â€œThe Summit welcomed the initiatives by SADC and its member States intended to assist in the restoration of peace, security and stability in the DRC, in particular the Victoria Falls and Pretoria initiatives. In that regard, the Summit reaffirmed its call for an immediate cessation of hostilities and commended the Governments of Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe for timeously providing troops to assist the Government and people of the DRC to defeat the illegal attempt by rebels and their allies to capture the capital city, Kinshasa, and other strategic areas. The Summit emphasized the need for all political actor in the DRC to commit themselves to orderly and peaceful transition to multi-party democracy, primarily through constructive consultations and negotiations involving all stakeholders.â€ As freedom fighters, we never relied on ethnicity to win victory against the oppressor nor can we ever accept today any idea of regional hegemony based on ethnicity and Herrenvolk tendencies from any quarter. African unity and cooperation must be based on a genuine spirit of solidarity and sharing, and not on subversion and disunity. There are some outstanding questions that I would like to deal with now briefly. Our agenda still has on it the unfinished business of, for example, decolonization, conflict resolution and peacekeeping. The legitimate cause of the Palestinian people, led by the Palestine Liberation Organization, and their full enjoyment of the right to self-determination, independence and sovereignty, cannot end with the creation of an Authority which is only an interim mechanism. The goal which the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement and certainly we in Namibia support, is that of unfettered statehood as envisaged in the Charter of the United Nations and international law. I say this simply to restate our well- known position on the question of Palestine. Cyprus, a fellow Member State of the United Nations and of the Commonwealth, is being bullied by a bigger and powerful neighbour which is perpetuating by means of fiat the unlawful division of that peaceful island State. Namibia is aware of the repeated initiatives of the Secretary-General to end the deadlock; so far his efforts have been unsuccessful. The United Nations and the world community must not forget the nation of Cyprus and its heroic people. At last, there is a light at the end of the tunnel concerning the resolution of the question of Western Sahara. Following the Houston accords brokered by Mr. James Baker, former United States Secretary of State, there is now an agreement between the parties concerned for a free and fair referendum to be held in December this year. With this in mind, Namibia urges the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations to ensure that the deadline is kept and that the people themselves are given a genuine choice regarding their future. In this way, Africaâs last colonial question will be finally resolved and the Kingdom of Morocco will return to the fold of the OAU, of which it is a proud founding member. It will be a happy day for all Africans. Now that the question of East Timor has been put back on the front burner, Namibia lends its full support to the latest steps that the Secretary-General has taken to find an amicable and lasting solution, in cooperation with Indonesia, Portugal and the inhabitants of East Timor. We apparently welcomed too hastily what we thought was good news concerning a peaceful settlement of the Lockerbie affair by the application of law. The good news has all of a sudden been eclipsed by bad news or misunderstandings that need to be carefully sorted out in the spirit of give and take among the principal parties. There are clearly serious legal and technical matters that require further consultations and clarifications between Libya, on the one hand, and the United Kingdom and the United States, on the other. Africaâs well-reasoned and constructive position on this issue was reinforced at the last OAU summit, held in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. In this connection, the decisions taken there are being implemented by African leaders. Among them is a renewed call for the Security Council to lift the punitive and outdated sanctions imposed on Libya several years ago. The suffering of innocent people should quickly be brought to an end. In conclusion, allow me to share a few personal thoughts. In his valedictory address to the General Assembly, President Mandela of South Africa referred to the connections between the United Nations and South Africa and invoked some memories of the past, beginning in 1946. Those memories and connections also included my own country, Namibia, a former colony of apartheid 30 South Africa and a territory for which the United Nations assumed direct legal responsibility for 24 years, from 1966 until 1990. That special linkage ended on 21 March 1990, the glorious day of our independence. But the long- established relationship between the United Nations family and the Namibian people continues unabated. During the past more than 26 years of my active involvement in politics and diplomacy, I have known the United Nations system as my home. In various incarnations, I have walked the heights, the depths and the corridors of this magnificent edifice of human brotherhood, liberation, equality and justice. Many mentors and friends from across the globe have held my hand in support, encouragement and solidarity. They have contributed enormously to my formation and maturity. I did my undergraduate and postgraduate studies in this country under a United Nations fellowship. On 25 September â€” that is, next Friday â€” I am going to receive an award from the World Association of Former United Nations Interns and Fellows for, they tell me, an â€œoutstanding contribution to the promotion of human rights, peace and development, especially within the context of promoting Namibiaâs nation-building and the role that United Nations training and other economic and technical cooperation activities can still playâ€. I am deeply touched by this generous gesture, and I am immensely grateful. This is the result of my partnership with the United Nations and its varied agencies as well as with friends the world over. I, actively supported by my Government, have announced my candidature for the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth regular session, in 1999. In this connection, I am most delighted to announce from this mighty rostrum that in June this year, in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government endorsed me as the sole African candidate for the position. I trust that I can count on all the Member States from other regions to cast their votes in support of my candidature when the time comes. By doing so, you will have made me extremely happy. But, more than that, you will have endorsed unanimously the collective wish of the African continent. Lastly, and in this context, I endorse the sentiments expressed by our Secretary-General in respect of making the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, which falls in the year 2000, the Millennium Assembly. But I believe the preparations must be made during the fifty-fourth session, and Africa is ready to lead the way into the twenty-first century.  Mr. President,I wish to congratulate you on your well-deserved election to preside over this session of the General Assembly. It is taking place at a time of profound change and disturbing economic and political developments in various parts of the world. Your responsibilities are correspondingly imposing. I am confident that your accomplishments will be similarly significant. Pakistan also wishes to convey its sincere appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Udovenko, for the skilful and productive manner in which he guided the Assembly?s work over the past year. As we seek to build the structures for peace and prosperity on the eve of a new millennium, the United Nations has become even more indispensable. In an increasingly interdependent world, the United Nations is the only organization where nations can come together and evolve decisions democratically on critical social and political issues which affect all peoples. Pakistan has profound faith in the purposes and the promise of the United Nations. I wish to pay a warm tribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who has moved to revive the United Nations with bold reforms. These reforms must reinforce the democratic ethos of the United Nations, especially in the Security Council, where the endeavour of some is to create new centres of privilege rather than eliminate old inequalities. The reform we pursue must be inspired by the noble vision of the United Nations Charter: social justice, universal prosperity and global peace and security. To do anything else is to do less than history demands of us. We are living in times of change and promise. The days of global confrontation are gone and doctrines of containment have lost relevance. The information and technological revolutions have brought about a phenomenal interaction among the peoples of the world. The global village is a reality. Today, the prosperity of one region supplements and supports that of another. The creed of our times must be partnership for peace and development. It will be an irony if the new vision and possibilities are lost because of narrow prejudices and interests. The world is also pervaded with a deep sense of foreboding. We are being propelled into a future which appears anarchic and insecure. In recent months, the triumphal hopes for the spread of free markets, democratic freedoms and world peace have suffered sobering setbacks. The crisis spreading from the erstwhile economic dynamo of East Asia has shaken confidence in the prescriptions of trade and financial liberalization. With falling incomes and failing hopes, strife has spread among and within nations in virtually every part of the world. This will negate the emerging prospects for ending hunger, disease and ignorance universally. New conflicts have appeared, while many old problems persist. The people of Kashmir and Palestine continue to suffer. Bosnia has seen a brutal war, and now Kosovo dreads the same fate. Internecine wars have scarred Africa. Afghanistan has yet to recover from the ravages of conflict. Peace has remained elusive in the Middle East. Tensions have been heightened in South Asia. There is increasing resort to the unilateral use of force and arbitrary actions against weaker nations. The multiple conflicts and suffering around the world have placed extraordinary demands on the United Nations. We are pained by the continuing tragedy of Palestine. The promise of peace has turned to despair and desperation. Peace cannot be achieved without the realization of the right of self-determination and statehood of the Palestinian people. Seventeen years of war have completely destroyed Afghanistan — its economy, society and polity. Pakistan has, more than any other country, borne the consequences of Afghanistan?s turmoil and suffering. We have a vital interest in the restoration of peace and stability in Afghanistan. Pakistan is deeply concerned at the current tensions between Iran and Afghanistan. We will continue to do all we can to promote peaceful and friendly relations between these two fraternal neighbours. Those responsible for the outrageous killing of the personnel seized from the Iranian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif must be apprehended and punished. We call for the release of all remaining Iranian personnel and other prisoners held by the parties to the Afghan conflict. We support a United Nations and Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) fact-finding mission to Afghanistan. We urge reconciliation within Afghanistan through realistic compromise and mutual accommodation. We call for international engagement and dialogue with 12 Afghanistan to promote the objectives of humanitarianism, human rights and peace. We ask for respect for the country?s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and observance of the principles of non-interference and non- use of force. This year the nuclear cloud has cast its dark shadow over South Asia. When India conducted its first explosion in 1974, the reaction of the major Powers was to impose restraints against Pakistan. We felt compelled to acquire a matching capability. Yet, even after we had done so, Pakistan continued to promote a nuclear-weapons-free zone, conventional arms restraint and a zero-missile zone in South Asia. India rejected all these initiatives. India?s nuclear tests in May should not have come as a surprise to the world. We had warned the world several weeks before the tests. Even after India conducted its tests, the response of the major Powers was weak and ambiguous. Once again, greater energy was devoted to restraining Pakistan than in responding to India. Immediately after its nuclear tests, India?s leaders adopted a belligerent posture towards Pakistan. They told us that the geostrategic balance had changed and that Pakistan should abandon its principled support for Kashmiri self-determination. Pakistan faced the threat of force. We felt compelled to convince India that any military aggression against Pakistan would have the most disastrous consequences. The world must appreciate that Pakistan did not initiate these tests. India tested to alter the strategic balance and threatened our security and sovereignty. We waited for 17 days for the world to respond. We knew that no country could provide us security assurances against a nuclear India. Thus circumstances forced us to test and establish nuclear deterrence in self-defence. We have violated no international norm. Regrettably, some friendly countries have imposed sanctions and other restrictions against Pakistan. These are unjust. I ask the international community to determine who is in the wrong and why Pakistan should be subjected to punitive measures. Pakistan?s nuclear tests were conducted not to challenge the existing non-proliferation regime, nor to fulfil any great power ambition; they were designed to prevent the threat or use of force against Pakistan. Our tests, in response to those of India, thus served the cause of peace and stability in our region. We are not insensitive to the concerns aroused by the South Asian nuclear tests. Despite the transformed strategic situation, we remain opposed to an arms race, nuclear or conventional. We have announced a unilateral moratorium on testing. We are prepared to strengthen peace and stability in the region by mutually agreed measures to avoid a war, to create a regime for nuclear restraint and conventional balance and to promote solutions to the underlying causes of conflict, in particular the Kashmir dispute. We will discuss these issues with India when our dialogue commences. We are also engaged in a dialogue with several friendly countries to advance these objectives. Pakistan has never contributed to nuclear proliferation. We will continue to adhere strictly to our policy of not exporting sensitive technologies and equipment. Pakistan consistently supported the conclusion of a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) for over 30 years. We voted for the Treaty when it was adopted by the General Assembly in 1996. We have declared a moratorium on further testing; so has India. There is no reason why the two countries cannot adhere to the CTBT. In a nuclearized South Asia, the CTBT would have relevance if Pakistan and India were both parties to the Treaty. The Non-Aligned Summit has called for universal adherence to the CTBT, especially by the nuclear-weapon States. This demand is consistent with the Treaty?s requirement that all nuclear-capable States, including India, must adhere to the CTBT before it can come into force. Pakistan will oppose any attempt to change this fundamental requirement at the conference of States parties to the Treaty, scheduled to be held in September 1999. Such a change can be made only by consensus. Pakistan is therefore prepared to adhere to the CTBT before that conference takes place. However, Pakistan?s adherence to the Treaty will take place only in conditions free from coercion or pressure. In this regard, we expect that the arbitrary restrictions imposed on Pakistan by multilateral institutions will be speedily removed. We also expect discriminatory sanctions against Pakistan to be lifted. And we count on the full support of the world community for a just resolution of the Kashmir dispute. On the nuclear issue, Pakistan will insist on the principle of equal treatment with India, whether in terms of status or any kind of incentives. It must also be well understood that if India should resume nuclear testing, Pakistan will review its position and, if we have adhered to the CTBT, invoke the supreme interests clause as provided for under article IX of the Treaty. 13 Nuclear deterrence between Pakistan and India will remain fragile and dangerous as long as there is a growing imbalance in conventional forces. This needs to be redressed. Above all, durable peace between Pakistan and India and restraint in their military postures will be, as always, critically dependent on the resolution of the Kashmir dispute, which has been the root cause of all conflicts and tensions between Pakistan and India. We welcome the recognition in the Secretary- General?s annual report that the “rising tension between India and Pakistan over Kashmir and other issues is ... a major cause of concern” (A/53/1, para. 18). For almost 50 years, the people of Kashmir have continued to await the exercise of the right of self-determination, as stipulated in the Security Council?s resolutions. India is obliged to allow the plebiscite prescribed in those United Nations resolutions. India has, however, failed to honour its commitments and resorted instead to a policy based on force to deny the legitimate rights of the Kashmiri people. Ten years ago, Kashmir?s freedom struggle entered a new phase when Indian forces fired on peaceful Kashmiri demonstrators, killing over 100. Kashmir is now occupied by a force of 650,000 Indian troops. Over 60,000 Kashmiris have been killed and thousands maimed and arrested. Custodial killings, disappearances, arbitrary arrests and summary executions continue to be daily occurrences. The nightmare of the Kashmiri people continues. This year, moreover, scores of innocent Kashmiris in Azad Kashmir have been killed and hundreds injured by intensified Indian artillery and mortar fire. Even as I speak, tensions are high on the line of control. My Government is committed to resolving our problem with India through dialogue. This is all the more important in a nuclear environment in which neither side has the luxury to contemplate the use of force. In June 1997, we agreed with India on an eight-item agenda and a mechanism for the dialogue. Unfortunately, the dialogue was interrupted due to differences over modalities. I am, however, happy to say that in a meeting which concluded a short while ago, Prime Minister Vajpayee and I reached an agreement to resume the dialogue with the commencement of talks at the Foreign Secretary level, which will address at the outset the primary issues of peace and security and Jammu and Kashmir. The United Nations, the major Powers and the international community have a responsibility to support and facilitate a solution to the Kashmir issue. We request the Secretary-General to take appropriate initiatives to implement Security Council resolutions on Kashmir and to ease tensions and build confidence. In particular, we urge that the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan be strengthened and its mandate enhanced. The Security Council should regularly monitor the volatile situation along the line of control in Jammu and Kashmir. Until last year, globalization of the world economy promised the spread of prosperity. Today, 30 per cent of the world economy is in recession; by next year, this figure is projected to double. Across East Asia, currencies have drastically depreciated, economies have contracted, incomes have plummeted and unemployment has risen, despite sound economic fundamentals. As the East Asian crisis spreads, questions are being posed about the economic wisdom of rapid financial and trade liberalization and the social implications of globalization. Yet, in the age of the information and communications revolution, globalization cannot be reversed; it can only be effectively governed. The world community must adopt a coherent approach to the current crisis. In the short term, it is essential to spur economic growth in all parts of the world. The international financial institutions must relax their unrealistic conditionalities to prevent any further contraction of the economies of the developing countries. Mechanisms need to be devised to direct greater development finance to the underdeveloped countries which have the largest latent demand. Meanwhile, markets, especially those of the industrial countries, must be kept open. New protectionism in the guise of concern for environmental or labour standards must be resisted. In order to address these issues effectively, we have to proceed from three basic premises. First, decisions on ways to manage globalization must be made collectively by all nations. Secondly, specific policies must flow from the overriding objective of ensuring growth with equity: equity is not only a moral imperative, it is now a prerequisite for sustained global growth. Thirdly, the North and South must act together: prosperity for both is interlinked. This suggests the need for concerted action by the international community, which should include, first, the 14 strengthening of the capacity of multilateral institutions to address the issues of trade, finance and development in an integrated and coherent manner, thereby ensuring the effective governance of globalization. In this context, a global monetary conference to address the old and new problems of the international finance system is now a necessity and should be convened urgently by the United Nations. Secondly, this action should include correcting the inequities in the international trade regime, especially by more rapid liberalization in areas of primary interest to developing countries. And finally, it should include resolution of the long-standing issues of debt, development finance and access to technology. What is required today is a realization that there is unity in the struggle of the South and the North for economic and social development. A new concept of a global community appears to be essential: a community where all human beings are acknowledged as being entitled to a life of dignity and to the right to development. The concept of the ummah, or community, in Islamic thought offers a model for the realization of such a global community. This concept gives primacy to solidarity among human beings and to equitable benefits to all members of the community. Islam is the religion of peace and tolerance; it is inherently moderate and progressive. Here, I would like to warmly welcome President Clinton's vision affirming America?s deep respect for Islam and rejecting the pernicious thesis of a clash of civilizations. We must work together to create greater understanding and harmony among all religions and peoples of the world. The present drift towards an uncertain and dangerous world must be arrested. Inequality, conflicts and abuse of human rights are not the inevitable consequences of impersonal forces of history. They are the outcome of our own actions. It is in our power to fashion a more equitable and more peaceful world. We can do so if we rededicate ourselves to the ideals of the United Nations Charter. Only then can we ensure that the next century will dawn on a prosperous and peaceful world.  Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Opertti upon his election to his prestigious position. I am convinced that he will guide us wisely through the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. The world community is now confronted with several dangerous situations which threaten the existence of millions of people, situations which demand immediate action by our Organization. I would like to draw special attention to the plight of the people of Kosovo and the alarming situation in several countries in Africa, where wars have caused appalling suffering and directly threaten the development and advancement of the whole continent. Our Organization is also confronted with issues of a universal nature which can determine the future of humankind, such as the protection of the environment and the delicate balance between economic growth and the conservation of natural resources. In this respect, the protection of the oceans and the marine ecosystem is one of the most important tasks facing us today. The fact that this is the International Year of the Ocean allows me to draw the Assembly?s attention to the fact that the oceans are the single largest source of protein and a crucial part of Earth?s ecosystem. We have to come to grips with the reality that the ocean?s bounty is finite and that the ocean is not a bottomless receptacle of human waste and pollution. Pollution of the seas from land-based sources remains a daunting problem. However, effective implementation of the Washington Global Programme of Action will certainly bring about much improvement in this respect. Pollution by persistent organic pollutants is another major concern. Prompt completion by the year 2000 of a legally binding instrument dealing with some of these pollutants will be an important step towards reducing and eventually eliminating this kind of pollution. Accidents in which radioactive material from nuclear waste treatment plants has spilled into the sea have demonstrated clearly the dangers of such facilities. Under 34 no circumstances should such plants be allowed to operate near the ocean. It is my hope that our generation will take the necessary measures so that future generations inherit clean oceans free from contamination. Nations with similar interests must strive for agreements on sharing and sensibly managing common stocks and fisheries on the high seas. We must ensure that the harvesting of living marine resources can continue and that economic development and conservation go hand in hand. In order to ensure a vibrant and profitable fisheries sector, States need to introduce the principles of private enterprise into the fishing industry and make its products compete on the free market. In Iceland we have devised a market-driven fisheries management system which encompasses both conservation of our resources and their sustainable use. The fishing stocks in the exclusive economic zone around Iceland have been steadily growing since a system of individual transferable fishing quotas was implemented in order both to achieve desired economic objectives and to protect our resources. However, fisheries in many parts of the world are overexploited. In my view, this is mainly due to the fisheries sector?s being inundated with government subsidies, resulting in excess fishing capacity and the distortion of market principles. No other single action could bring about such positive results, in a short time, towards achieving sustainable development in fisheries as the elimination of government subsidies. I would like to note that when we read United Nations publications dealing with the state of the world?s fisheries we are continually confronted with the expression “overfishing”, not “fishing”. This implies, first, that fisheries everywhere are utilized to the hilt, and, secondly, that States in general have failed in the management of the resources inside their economic zones. This gives a wrong picture of the situation. I wish to draw the Assembly?s attention to an interesting study issued a few weeks ago by the World Wildlife Fund on the root causes of the depletion of fish resources in many parts of the world. The study states that overcapacity in fishing fleets is a key factor and that Government subsidies of this industry is another. It rightly points out that one solution to this problem would be to issue each fishing vessel tradeable rights to a percentage of the catch. It goes on to say that this system has worked well in New Zealand, Australia and Iceland. In the negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change we stressed that the further harnessing of Iceland?s abundant, clean and renewable energy sources could contribute towards the global effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Iceland has for decades placed special emphasis on the utilization of clean and renewable energy sources, such as geothermal energy and hydropower. Of its own accord, and through extensive investment, Iceland has replaced fossil fuels for space heating and electricity generation with clean and renewable energy sources. Those efforts, made prior to 1990, have severely limited the possibilities for Iceland to further reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. In our view, it must be recognized that the economy of some countries is dependent on few natural resources. They therefore have fewer options to secure their economic base by comparison with countries with diverse economies. It is both illogical and unfair to deny countries the right to harness and utilize clean and renewable energy. Such a result would run counter to the objective of the Convention and be incompatible with Agenda 21. This year?s substantive session of the Economic and Social Council demonstrated clearly that the industrialized countries must make a concentrated effort to remove barriers to trade and integrate the developing countries into global markets. Many developing countries now have flourishing private sectors, competing in world markets. Last month I had the pleasure of visiting some countries in the southern part of Africa, of observing the enormous human and natural wealth of these countries and of learning first hand about the possibilities available to the people there. It is clear that peace has brought prosperity to those countries. My country is engaged in development cooperation in that area, focusing on human capacity-building as well as training and education in the field of fisheries. It should be stressed that, parallel to the privatization of the economy, there must be increased funding for building up social services, health care and education. It is my firm intention that Iceland shall increase its official development assistance to our partner countries in Africa. This fall, I had the pleasure of welcoming the first students, coming from three African countries, of the new United Nations University Fisheries Training Programme in Iceland. We hope that in the future students from all parts of the world will come for training in all aspects of the fishing industry. 35 I would especially like to draw attention to the importance of strengthening the position and role of women in society, mainly with regard to their education and active participation in the economy. In this respect, we have to tackle the problem of overpopulation with comprehensive solutions. The volatility in the world?s financial markets has led to severe recession in many countries and slowed economic growth in others. Globalization is a part of the development of the world today, and for all countries it entails both risks and benefits. The risks must be borne by all, and the benefits must be spread evenly and widely, especially to the poorest. Our Organization has seldom had more urgent tasks than preserving peace, security and human rights. I would like to express great concern over the nuclear tests recently conducted by two countries in South Asia, and I welcome recent statements by those States that they will adhere to the provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. War has visited many countries since we gathered here last year. Keeping peace requires our constant vigilance. In several African countries war and ethnic tension have brought death and destruction. The cruel fate of children in war is more evident now than ever before. Once again the people of the former Yugoslavia are confronted with a problem of tragic proportions. In Kosovo thousands of refugees are facing hunger and a cold winter. Conflicts where the civilian population is targeted are abhorrent and leave scars that take a long time to heal. We now recognize that preserving peace demands more intensive measures than before, such as the strengthening of democratic institutions, policing, overseeing elections, establishing judiciary systems and monitoring human rights. In many countries it is as though the Middle Ages had never ended and the darkness of intolerance, cruelty and human rights abuses descends on people?s lives every day. The fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights should encourage us to be stalwart in our principles. Human rights are universal, and the veil of religion and tradition cannot and will not be accepted as an excuse for tolerating flagrant human rights violations. The international community must deal successfully with problems such as terrorism and war crimes. The world community has had to look on in horror as terrorists have, in cowardly fashion, targeted innocent people going about their everyday lives. We urge States to sign and ratify the counter-terrorism conventions. The adoption of the Statute of the International Criminal Court this summer in Rome shows the firm commitment of the international community to let law take precedence over lawlessness and justice over injustice. Once the court is firmly in place it is our hope that criminals who commit atrocious acts, such as crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes, will have no escape from the long reach of international law. We urge all States to sign and ratify the Statute. We look forward to the effective implementation of the agreed outcome of the General Assembly?s special session on drugs. Enhancing judicial cooperation and law enforcement cooperation is essential, as well as bearing down on money-laundering worldwide. The elimination of illicit crops should be a high priority in the global drug control strategy. We strongly support the Norwegian and Canadian initiative to control the proliferation of small arms and light weapons. The huge number of these weapons should be of great concern to the international community. Our Organization must enter the next millennium as an effective and reformed Organization, with lean management, result-based budget, increased action potential in the most vital fields, strengthened finances and a clear commitment from all Member countries to pay their contributions without conditions. Finally, Iceland is committed to the ideals of the United Nations. We have always been ready to shoulder our responsibilities in every aspect of the Organization?s work because we believe that all Member countries should make their mark on events shaping the world we live in today.   Allow me first of all, on behalf of the delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, to congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay, on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its current session. We believe that his rich experience and diplomatic skill in dealing with international affairs will lead this session to fruitful results. We also express our gratitude to the former President, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his successful stewardship of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly. At the same time, I wish to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his efforts devoted to the maintenance of international peace and security. It is the wish and aspiration of humankind to make the forthcoming twenty-first century peaceful and prosperous. In this connection, we believe that working out appropriate ways and means to achieve that end should be the main focus of the current session. The next century should be one of independence. In order to build a world free of all forms of domination and subordination and to ensure equality among all countries and nations, independence should be realized throughout the world. Only when all Member States adhere to the Juche character and the national character and firmly maintain independence in all fields of State activities can international peace and security also be ensured. At the first session of the tenth Supreme People’s Assembly of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, held on 5 September this year, our people unanimously reelected with high esteem the Great Leader Comrade Kim Jong Il as Chairman of the National Defence Committee. The chairmanship of the National Defence Committee is the highest post of the State, organizing and leading the work of defending the country and the destiny of the people, as well as strengthening and increasing the defence capabilities of the country and State power as a whole through command over all its political, military and economic forces. It is a sacred and important post that symbolizes and represents the honour of the country and the dignity of the nation. The election of our Great Leader General Kim Jong Il as Chairman of the National Defence Committee is the most significant event in the sacred cause of strengthening and developing our Republic and in achieving prosperity and happiness for all generations to come. It is a vivid expression of our people’s absolute trust in, support for and boundless loyalty to their leader. Some time ago, our people enthusiastically celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. What pleased our people most at this emotional juncture was the fact that our scientists and technicians successfully launched into orbit an artificial satellite, Kwangmyongsong No. 1, using a multi-stage rocket carrier developed by us in our own way, with our own knowledge and 100 per cent our own technology. It was the first of its kind in the country. The successful launching of our first artificial satellite was an historic event demonstrating the might of our scientific and technical development, and it will make a great contribution to safeguarding world peace and enriching the store of science and technology for humankind. In the last 50 years, the Government of our Republic has been able to safeguard the sovereignty of our country, advance the socialism chosen by our people towards victory and defend peace on the Korean peninsula by holding fast to the Juche character and the national character, while firmly maintaining independence in all fields of State activities. Throughout the country our entire population is now fully determined to glorify our socialism, which is centred on the popular masses, under the banner of the Republic founded by our Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung, the founding father of socialist Korea. The people uphold the leadership of the respected and beloved General Kim Jong Il. In the near future, the world will see the independent and peace-loving Democratic People’s Republic of Korea develop into a prosperous Power. The reunification of Korea and peace and security on the Korean peninsula have long been a main area of concern for the international community. From the viewpoint of both the misfortune and suffering of a nation 31 and the peace and security of a region, the division of the Korean peninsula should not last any longer. Due to the fact that Korea has not yet been reunified, military confrontation and tensions grow increasingly aggravated between the United States, Japan and South Korea, on the one hand, and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on the other. As a result of the present military manoeuvres against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on and around the Korean peninsula, there is a growing danger that either the twentieth century may close or the twenty-first century may open with another Korean war. This danger should be removed by all possible means. In order to remove the danger of war and ensure a durable peace on the Korean peninsula, the reunification of the country should be achieved without fail. Independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity are the three principles of national reunification agreed upon between the North and the South. These principles were also welcomed and supported by the United Nations. The Government of our Republic consistently maintains that Korea should be reunified by means of confederacy on the basis of the three principles of reunification. In April this year, our Great Leader, Comrade Kim Jong Il, advanced the five-point policy for the great unity of the entire nation as part of his continued efforts for national reunification. The main elements of the five-point policy are the principle of national independence; a change in policy by the South Korean authorities towards reconciliation and alliance with the North; dialogue for the unity and reunification of the whole nation; the promotion of coexistence, co-prosperity and public interests between the North and the South; and solidarity and coalition between the North, South and the international community. The Government of our Republic will spare no effort to achieve these points. We have been consistently in favour of dialogue for reunification and to improve relations between the North and South of Korea. The North-South dialogue should be conducted on the basis of the principles of placing the common interests of the nation above all, removing distrust and confrontation between the North and the South and subordinating everything to the cause of national reunification. No one should be allowed to use dialogue for dishonest political purposes or to perpetuate the division of the country. If the South Korean authorities show their sincere desire for reunification by taking practical actions — such as abolishing the National Security Law and the like — we will meet with them at any time and hold dialogues and consultations to discuss the common destiny of the nation and work together for national reunification. In order for the Korean people to resolve the questions of national unity and reunification by themselves, concerned countries, including the United States and Japan, should refrain from hindering the efforts of the Korean people. The United States Army is the main military entity in South Korea and has long been in belligerent relations with us. This is a quite abnormal phenomenon in today’s post-cold-war international relations and the product of anachronistic thinking. It is the United States military entity and no other that constitutes the major obstacle in the way of the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea. In this forum, we once again strongly urge the United States to withdraw its forces from South Korea and to end its belligerent relations with us. The States Members of the United Nations should no longer claim to be unaware that the name and flag of the United Nations continue to be abused to conceal these belligerent relations. We are convinced that the most appropriate way of maintaining peace on the Korean peninsula is to dissolve the United Nations command in South Korea and to conclude a peace agreement between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United States. This is our unchanging position. Japan should not hinder the cause of our reunification by aggravating the tense situation on the Korean peninsula. Japan must discharge its responsibility for the Korean question by sincerely apologizing and providing compensation for its enormous crimes against our people, instead of attempting to declare war against us by drawing up so-called “emergency legislation”, aimed at keeping pace militarily with the United States, the belligerent party with us. Recently, too, the Japanese authorities behaved unreasonably when they publicly questioned our satellite launch and acted rashly in taking the issue to the Security Council, insisting that it respond to our launch. This was a flagrant mockery of the international community. If our satellite launch is a serious security concern, Japan’s satellite launches should be top priority for the Security Council’s consideration. 32 With just one year to go before the twenty-first century, the United Nations is faced with the task of building a new world free from all forms of domination and subordination. New challenges in safeguarding world peace and security, achieving the denuclearization of the world and ensuring social progress and economic development require the United Nations to find appropriate new measures. Almost all the recent attempts by a few big countries, as opposed to the United Nations membership as a whole, to deal with international matters have met with failure. This proves that the era of power politics and big-Power arbitrary action ended with the cold war. The United Nations is now at a crossroads. It can either be dictated to by big countries or become the Organization of a new era in which the purposes and principles of its Charter are safeguarded and fully realized. The reform of the United Nations should correctly reflect this reality. At present, the most undemocratic organ in the United Nations system is the Security Council. The current composition of the Council does not represent the general United Nations membership and the veto power of its permanent members often subverts the wishes of the majority of member States. If the United Nations is to be democratized, the Security Council should be reformed. To this end, the expansion of the non-permanent category should be given precedence, thus correcting, to a certain extent, the current imbalance in the Council’s composition. Its working methods must be improved for the sake of transparency. Priority should be given to the developing countries in the expansion of the Council’s permanent membership. Any State that has failed to atone for its past is not eligible for permanent membership. As for relations between the General Assembly and the Security Council, the authority of the General Assembly should be enhanced decisively. Recent events in southern Asia, witnessed by the entire world, remind us all that disarmament, especially nuclear disarmament, should remain a priority on the agenda of the United Nations. Although several years have elapsed since the end of the cold war, nuclear stockpiles around the world have become more sophisticated rather than being reduced. When the international community called for a ban on all nuclear explosive tests, the nuclearweapon States opted for subcritical tests. The proliferation of nuclear weapons cannot be prevented so long as the nuclear-weapon States pursue a monopoly of nuclear weapons. The policy of the nuclearweapon States to provide a nuclear umbrella and their double standards in dealing with nuclear issues are among the obstacles to making nuclear disarmament a reality. The United Nations should decisively strengthen its role in the field of disarmament. In this regard, we believe that there is a growing need to convene a fourth special session of the General Assembly on disarmament. The issue of human rights needs to be dealt with objectively and impartially within the framework of the United Nations. In today’s international relations, the human rights issue has became synonymous with intervention in the internal affairs of other countries. Attempts to impose the values of one nation upon others are rampant. Consequently, the rights of people to choose and the sovereign rights of nations are being infringed. The United Nations should reject the politicization of human rights and never tolerate double standards in the implementation of human rights instruments. The twenty-first century should be devoted to development and cooperation. Economic development and the sustained growth of the developing countries should become a main theme in international economic relations. To this end, the current inequitable international economic relations need to be redressed and the external debt issue resolved. Economic sanctions run counter to the ideal of cooperation, are anachronistic, and only incite confrontation among nations. Countries that see economic sanctions as an instrument of power and authority should pay due attention to the fact that many people, at home and abroad, are increasingly sceptical about and opposed to them. Globalization has caused the monetary crisis in Asia, increasing the poverty and marginalization of the developing countries. The United Nations should find ways to meet this new challenge. It should play its rightful role in strongly promoting the spirit of collective self-reliance of the developing countries and urging the implementation of official development assistance by the developed countries. The delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea appreciates the efforts of the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America to develop regional and subregional cooperation in the spirit of collective selfreliance. We also support Syria and other Arab countries 33 in their just struggle to seek a fair and comprehensive solution to the Middle East problem and appreciate the efforts of the countries of Africa to promote peace, security and development there. I take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the Governments, organizations and individuals of various countries, as well as the United Nations and governmental and non-governmental international organizations, for their humanitarian assistance with the damage caused by several consecutive years of natural disaster in my country. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is an independent peace-loving State and its Government consistently adheres to the fundamental ideal of independence, peace and friendship in its foreign policy. The Government of our Republic will develop relations of friendship and cooperation with all countries respecting its sovereignty and continue to make every effort to ensure peace on the Korean peninsula and to safeguard peace and security in North-East Asia, in conformity with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. My delegation will contribute to the best of its ability to the successful deliberation of all items on the agenda of the current session.   First, let me congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of this important session. I am certain that this session will provide us with the opportunity to discuss the role that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has played during the last 50 years and has yet to play. I should also like to take this opportunity to convey my respects to the Secretary-General, who, by his decisive steps in critical moments this year, has repeatedly demonstrated the importance of the United Nations in contemporary world affairs. Throughout the last 50 years the United Nations has changed no less dynamically than the rest of the surrounding world. Reviewing the successes and failures of the Organization, we have to acknowledge its complex and important role in building a more peaceful world. The United Nations at present is living through a complicated period of internal reform designed to reinforce the values and principles which half a century ago encouraged the States of the world to sign the Charter establishing the United Nations, which guides us today into the twenty- first century. I speak of peace, democracy and the environment and of ensuring and promoting the development of freedom of the individual. This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This crucial instrument declares the will of the people of the world to establish a universal understanding of individual freedom, equality and dignity, which are indivisible and must not be undermined. Today we should be particularly concerned to what extent the principles declared by the United Nations throughout the last 50 years have become the bedrock of our everyday life. It would be most appropriate to ask whether the United Nations has become an Organization of world nations rather than States. In the contemporary world of advanced communications, the exchange of values and ideas takes place at a particularly high speed. It is therefore not surprising that freedom, justice and well-being carry the same meaning in Europe and Asia, Africa and America. I believe we are approaching a common denominator for democracy so that democracy will no longer be identified only with the West and rapid economic development only with certain regions of the world. Above all, we hope that the realization of human rights throughout the world is consistent with the spirit of the Declaration of Human Rights signed 50 years ago. In the cold-war world of divided ideologies, the United Nations was one of the very few forums embodying the common human interest: the concern for peace. Today the United Nations can contribute considerably to the creation and education of free individuals and active citizens of the world. History has proved that democratic and prosperous States provide the most favourable environment for human activities. The United Nations should therefore continue its efforts to promote democratization and sustainable development. The ongoing institutional reform of the Organization may serve this end. However, I should like also to underscore the need to pay even greater attention to the promotion and protection of human rights. Willingly and freely we have empowered the Security Council to make binding decisions to which we are then committed. We therefore want the decisions to be of high quality, effective and acceptable. Two highly qualified industrialized countries could become permanent members of the Security Council; their membership would strengthen the Council and ensure democratic decisions. A broader representation of developing nations on the Council would also reinforce its legitimacy and enhance respect for it. These nations deserve additional seats, both permanent and non-permanent. Equitable representation in the Council should be expanded through a more just representation of regions, Central and Eastern Europe in particular. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, has noted that todayâs human rights violations are the causes of tomorrowâs conflicts. War-ravaged Bosnia and conflict-inflamed Kosovo today are painful illustrations of these words. Lithuania welcomes the initiative of Secretary-General Kofi Annan to integrate human rights protection into the broad range of the Organizationâs activities. We likewise welcome the ongoing institutional reforms of human rights protection and propose to employ with greater effectiveness the experience and intellectual potential of such regional bodies as the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. One of the most laudable recent achievements of the worldâs nations is the adoption of the Statute of the International Criminal Court. By taking this decision, the international community demonstrated its readiness for a qualitative leap in international relations based on an effective system of international justice â€” an instrument designed to complement national legal systems and to encourage their continuous development. It is gratifying that the Court has been granted the right to charge persons with criminal responsibility for the gravest crimes of all: genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. This step demonstrates our resolution to fight against the horrors for which there are no â€” and cannot be any â€” political or ideological boundaries. â€œCrime of aggressionâ€ in the Statute is a pending issue requiring the political will of States and a more precise legal definition. The bitter facts of modern history remind us that aggression too often leads to genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. I would like to note that Lithuania, which actively participated in the work of the Preparatory Committee and the Rome Conference, will in the near future sign the Statute of the International Criminal Court. Today we all face the challenges of our contemporary world which have been caused by rapidly developing technologies and negligent human activities. These challenges, although not as evident as open military conflicts, are no less threatening. A devastated and deteriorating environment may cause conflicts on a scale unknown before. The struggle for fresh water, rich soil and natural resources can turn man against man and 2 nation against nation. Neither democratic political processes nor economic development will matter then. As a man with a long-standing commitment to environmental protection, I invite you to make use of the international capabilities of the United Nations and to pay more attention to ecological issues. If we are genuine in our attempt to place this institution at the vanguard of human rights protection, environmental issues should be given priority on our agenda. Lithuania will support every initiative to preserve and conserve natural resources. As one such step, I yesterday signed the Kyoto Protocol, reaffirming our commitment to tackling global warming by reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. Now we look forward to decisive action on climate change in Buenos Aires later this year. Every individual has the incontestable right to live in a healthy and clean environment. I am certain that the United Nations can play a significant role in promoting respect for the environment among people and States of the world. With its long experience in international cooperation and its prominent international standing, this Organization can contribute notably to the environmental education of the global community. It can also serve as a promoter of inter- State cooperation through the timely exchange of information on disasters â€” past, present and future. The Prior Informed Consent (PIC) Convention on trade in hazardous chemicals and pesticides, which was signed in Rotterdam a couple of days ago, is a remarkable example of prospective activities of the United Nations system. The growing problems of international crime and terrorism affecting us are no less important than environmental issues. Terrorist bombings and illicit trafficking in arms, narcotic substances and human beings, as well as money laundering, infringe the vital interests of people and States to live in a secure and predictable world. The solution to these problems demands collective efforts as well as resolute and immediate action. It is gratifying that the heads of State and Government, as well as interior ministers, confirmed their commitment to constructive cooperation at the twentieth special session of the United Nations General Assembly, on drugs. The approved drug- demand reduction and prevention programme, along with the guidelines for international cooperation, should facilitate the resolution of these problems. Children and young people â€” our future â€” should be the focus of the fight against drug-trafficking. Timely adoption and launching of preventive measures and educational programmes, as well as the building of a drug- free environment, must be our immediate first steps. It is delightful that Secretary-General Kofi Annan has shown particular attention to this problem. Control of the arms trade, which is becoming increasingly complex, is another painful reality facing us at the end of this century. Smugglers arm not only terrorists, but also nations or States at war. Without any further delay we should forestall illicit arms circulation by, first and foremost, restricting the sale of small arms and light weapons in conflict zones. We should persist in our efforts to find an effective solution to the issue of general and complete disarmament. The nuclear arms race, which emerged in South Asia this year, has revealed the survival of the cold war ideology of the balance of powers in the political thinking of certain States. Such reasoning is short on constructiveness since it does not enhance international security, and it diverts human resources and creative powers into erroneous directions, undermining the aspirations of the individual to a safer and wealthier life. Lithuania is neither a zone of potential conflict nor a place for the manufacturing or circulation of conventional weapons or weapons of mass destruction. Nevertheless, Lithuania endeavours to participate actively in different agreements on disarmament and arms control through which it helps itself and others. My country has ratified the conventions prohibiting biological, chemical and certain conventional weapons. Ratification of the convention prohibiting anti-personnel mines is our long- term goal. It is my belief that the right of the individual to a secure life and future â€” a right still missing from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights â€” fully corresponds to the spirit of the Declaration and should be realized through our political initiatives. The security of the individual will be best ensured if the State he lives in is secure. Good neighbourly relations and close regional cooperation are prerequisites for the peaceful coexistence of nations, and all humankind aspires to this. Lithuania is guided by those principles and maintains friendly, constructive relations with all its neighbours, Russia among them. The United Nations today acts not only in a multi- polar but also multi-problem environment. By itself it is not capable of addressing and resolving all the problems which we often tend to call â€œhotâ€ issues and which demand immediate solutions. Therefore, the Organization 3 should interact with greater vigour in its endeavours with regional organizations that, in many cases, succeed in the areas where global forums fail. Europe has already provided us with an example of such productive interaction through concrete cooperation of the United Nations with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Europe, however, has other, smaller organizations which can also considerably contribute to the goals of the United Nations and to the implementation of their spirit. The Council of the Baltic Sea States, of which Lithuania has recently assumed the chairmanship, is one of them. This Council unites geographical neighbours who also enjoy many, more binding links: the promotion of mutual confidence, trade, culture and environmental protection. During the term of its chairmanship, Lithuania will strive for a more active and effective contribution of this regional cooperation body to the implementation of the goals of the United Nations. The fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a reminder of the indivisibility of the values of human life, dignity and welfare. Political activities at both the international and national levels should be directed to promoting and protecting these values. More and more threats to human rights and freedoms arise today from sources beyond the control of national Governments. Never before have the issues of coordination and enhanced cooperation been as crucial as they are today. The United Nations possesses all the potential necessary to perform the role of active international coordinator and peace promoter. But the realization of this potential requires determination from us, the representatives of nations and members of the international community.  Allow me to join previous speakers in congratulating Mr. Opertti on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. There is no doubt that his experience and wisdom will be very useful in effectively guiding our work. I should also like to pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for his valuable contribution to the work of this Organization and its reform process. After the euphoria following the end of the cold war, a period of frustration and disillusionment set in. It has therefore not always been easy to remain optimistic while experiencing everyday realities. Indeed, the profound changes that shook the world left it poorly prepared to deal with old or new challenges. Recently, events that have shaken the world?s security environment and the international economic environment have reminded us of the complexities of the post-bipolar period by highlighting the multiple and often detrimental effects of the inexorable process of globalization that is taking place in all parts of the world. If we are to be in a position to stem the damaging effects of this process, we must strengthen multilateralism and expand international cooperation so as to be able to resolve the various problems, often unprecedented in nature, that face humankind at the threshold of the twenty-first century. In this undertaking, the United Nations will be neither a world government nor a passive spectator. It will continue to be a unique Organization with special responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security. It will continue to be a global negotiating forum whose purpose is to set consensus-based standards and rules in the most diverse spheres of human activity in order to help us adapt to the demands of a new age. Today?s world is marked by disquieting developments: bloody conflicts, terrorist acts, organized crime, the resurgence of ethnic hatred, attempts to circumvent or undermine non-proliferation regimes, human rights violations causing flows of refugees, problems associated with narcotic drugs, a worrisome gap between the levels of economic and social development of the various parts of the world, environmental degradation, population questions and many other issues and dilemmas that are truly global in nature. Despite the setbacks that it will probably encounter in the future fulfilment of its mission, the world Organization will continue to be the centre of worldwide mobilization of efforts to prepare the peoples of the United Nations to tackle the challenges that lie before them. In order to ensure the success of this operation, we must all make serious and sustained efforts to give new impetus to the United Nations reform process and to maintain its dynamism. The difficulties encountered along the way should not discourage us from the quest to identify what is possible and feasible, while keeping in mind and striving to achieve what is desirable. From this rostrum, we wish to reaffirm our commitment to promoting the revitalization of our Organization and the reform of the Security Council. As far as expanding the membership of the Council is concerned, our position has not changed. We continue to advocate expanding the Council in both categories, permanent and non-permanent, and the inclusion of Germany and Japan, among others, in the category of permanent members. On the subject of United Nations reform, I should like to add that organizational and structural measures must go hand in hand with efforts to establish financial stability for the Organization if they are to be effective. Domestically the historic transition that has taken place in Hungary over the last decade has been a complex 20 and difficult experience for the country?s population. After living through this arduous period and in the light of the promising developments in the country, our country today needs to be reassured about its future. Our people wish to see moral and social renewal in the country and to benefit from it. Externally, the new Hungarian Government continues to base its policy on the same principles that its predecessors followed starting in 1990, when a democratic regime was established in Hungary. It is inspired by the national interests of the country and the values that it shares with its partners on both sides of the Atlantic. It intends to remain a factor for stability and security in the Central European region. Along with its future allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and in the European Union, it stands ready to contribute to the endeavours of the community of nations to ensure respect for international obligations and, where necessary, to take effective measures to resist actions that are in defiance of its legitimate will. Our efforts, which are aimed at having Hungary join the Euro-Atlantic consolidating structures, are motivated by our desire for security and economic prosperity, as well as by the emotional desire to see a historic reunion with the rest of Europe after a long, imposed separation. These aspirations are fully in keeping with the purposes and principles of the United Nations. Not only do they not conflict with them, but they complement and enrich in a very positive way our present activities in the world Organization. They will serve to strengthen our specific participation in various United Nations activities. Obviously, becoming a member of these consolidating structures will not change Hungary?s place on the world map. It will not be transported to some other planet. It will remain an integral part of our world, sharing with other nations great and small, rich and poor, the bright as well as the gloomier aspects of globalization. Problems such as international crime and terrorism, the proliferation of weapons, drug-trafficking and questions associated with migration or environmental pollution — all these phenomena affect my country as they do others, and call for national, regional and international action. They may jeopardize the institutional structures of democracy and paralyse social and economic stability in a particular country and beyond its borders. The resurgence that we have seen in acts of terrorism should also bolster the international community?s determination to establish international cooperation on the largest possible scale so as to combat this evil by the most efficient means. The centre of these operations should be the United Nations, which will give these endeavours coherence and real universality. Hungary attaches great importance to developing and expanding regional and subregional cooperation with its neighbours. It has a vital interest in seeing stability and democracy flourish among its neighbours. It considers the various forms of regional and subregional cooperation to be invaluable and indispensable tools for achieving these objectives. It is ready to participate actively in this regard. It should be noted that one of the driving forces for the implementation by the countries of the region of positive measures for socio-economic progress is precisely their shared wish to join the structures of Euro-Atlantic integration. Hungary has often spoken out in favour of these aspirations and will continue to support them. In this regard, we feel that respect for the rule of law and institutional guarantees of the full enjoyment of human rights, including those of national minorities, are not simply key prerequisites to membership of these integration structures. They are also an indispensable and vital factor for the establishment of social peace within countries themselves. In speaking of the eastern part of our continent, I would emphasize that, on the one hand, it is impossible to transform the region, with its turbulent history of age- old coexistence between various ethnic communities, into a zone of tranquillity and prosperity, and inconceivable to consider healing the deep wounds inflicted by aggressive nationalism without taking into account the legitimate aspirations of national minorities and their desire to remain intact as communities and keepers of a specific national heritage, in accordance with the standards adopted by the competent international organizations and the practice of the democratic States. On the other hand, we resolutely oppose the policy of “ethnic cleansing”, forced separation and the creation of new kinds of ethnic or religious segregation in Europe at the dawn of a new century. Hungary is deeply concerned by the deteriorating situation in Kosovo. It shares the view that, without a determined international commitment, this conflict is likely to spread, with unfathomable consequences for the region and Europe as a whole. We therefore support the efforts aimed at stopping this conflict as quickly as possible by peaceful and political means. We believe that Security Council resolution 1199 (1998) can serve to pave the way for this. Hungary hopes that substantive negotiations between the parties can begin without delay and that they will lead to a lasting settlement granting broad autonomy to Kosovo while preserving the territorial 21 integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In this respect, Hungary stresses the primary responsibility borne by the Yugoslav authorities in the quest for peace and a democratic solution. The Balkans have suffered too much for the international community to permit an escalation of violence, a return to terror and impunity for human rights violations. My country is prepared, to the extent of its abilities, to contribute to the international community?s action to restore long-term stability and the rule of law in the region. We have also followed with special attention the developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our primary objective is the full implementation of the Dayton Agreement. However, we must accept the fact that, following years of bloodshed, savagery and intolerance, the process envisaged in the Agreement could be more precarious and protracted than we believed and that the ethnocentric and exclusionary attitudes there may prove to be more entrenched than we had thought. Having said this, we are participating actively in the international effort to assist that country in getting back on its feet and to ensure that the terrible years of aggression and horrendous war never return. This year, we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Although the commemoration of the birth of that fundamental document is a fine occasion for festivities, it is also important that new measures be taken to implement the universal standards embodied in the Declaration so that the United Nations may, in all places and at all times, not only offer a ray of hope, but be an effective instrument in the service establishment of United Nations machinery for the international protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms is one of the international community?s great achievements, emanating directly from the Universal Declaration. In this context, we welcome the existence of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the establishment, after much hard work, of the International Criminal Court. Grave and large-scale human rights abuses continue to be committed throughout the world. We have witnessed assaults on the freedom of individuals and communities, and crude and more subtle discriminatory practices, including those based on national or religious origin. This prompts us to ask the fundamental question as to whether the international community did all it needed to do in good time to prevent these events and used all the means available to it. I am afraid that the answer to these questions is “no”. Linking peace to justice and reconciling political expediency and moral considerations have always been extremely difficult challenges. Nevertheless, if peace is to last and take firm root, it must be sustained and bolstered by democracy, the rule of law and a responsible and transparent system of government. That is why we support the introduction of the human rights dimension into all United Nations spheres of activity, including peacekeeping operations. That is why we insist that those accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the various conflicts, from the Great Lakes to the former Yugoslavia, must be brought to justice. The measures taken in this regard deserve the support of all the Members of our Organization. We cannot allow our attention to be distracted from the grave ongoing situations in many regions of our world, where political upheaval, financial crisis and natural disaster render human existence extremely precarious and arduous. The United Nations cannot turn its back on these pressing problems. We welcome the attention rightly accorded to Africa by the Organization and to the search for solutions to its difficulties. Our world is shrinking every day. Therefore, a heightened awareness of worldwide concerns and human solidarity is vital. For what is at stake today is the future of our civilization and the quality of life of future generations on Earth. We must not miss the opportunity offered by the end of the century to decide how to improve the lot of the human race. The United Nations is the best place to tackle, without delay, the crucial questions facing mankind.   Allow me first of all, on behalf of the people of Togo and President Eyadema and his Government, to join in the congratulations extended to you, Sir, since the beginning of our work on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. We would also like to congratulate his your illustrious predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, on the effective manner in which he conducted the work of the fifty-second session. I would furthermore like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and his colleagues for their continuous efforts to champion the noble ideals of peace, justice, progress and solidarity embodied by the United Nations. By way of analysing the situation in Africa, I would like to present Togo?s perspective of the world?s problems in the context of improved international cooperation. Africa is democratizing, but it needs peace and security if it is to succeed. Africa is the continent most affected by the great scourges of the planet, but its development is also part of a dynamic of progress. The scourges hampering its development are well known: endemic disease, drought, poverty, political instability, ethnic conflicts, civil wars and regional conflicts. These scourges have a tendency to eclipse the successes. Since the signing of the Abuja Treaty in 1991, Africa has set itself a timetable for integration in the framework of the African Economic Community, on the basis of strengthening regional groupings of western, northern, central, eastern and southern Africa. These groups are themselves actively engaged in seeking joint solutions to the challenges confronting its member States. The rate of economic growth of certain African States continues to make progress thanks to good management policies. A vast democratic movement has begun throughout our continent to build States based on the rule of law. This movement is being followed up by the adoption of new constitutions and the establishment of independent bodies to implement them. Numerous heads of State and of Government have had their mandates challenged in periodic elections. The majority and the opposition representatives of the people have seats in the new representative bodies — parliaments and national assemblies. The success of the functioning of these new constitutional bodies is ensured by independent legal bodies. The press is now free, as are labour unions in most of our States. I am emphasizing these institutional aspects of building a new Africa because the respect and support of the international community for these institutions is a factor in favour of peace within the particular States, and therefore for peace in our regions. Experience has shown us that a domestic conflict, by giving rise to an exodus of people to neighbouring countries, also has a rapid and serious effect on the latter. I repeat, as the current situation in the Great Lakes region demonstrates, such domestic conflicts can lead to regional crises. Togo is among the States that voluntarily established institutions that safeguard the rule of law and that can arbitrate disputes that may arise in the new context of democratization. It is in this framework that the Constitutional Court of Togo declared the results of the presidential election of 21 June 1998 after having arbitrated the disputes that resulted from the election. Togo?s respect for institutions is the very foundation of democracy and peace. On behalf of my Government, I would like to invite all of our partners at the United Nations to support without distinction the efforts of all the countries of Africa that commit themselves to the difficult but rewarding path of building a State of law. This is the price of peace in Africa. While we can be gratified at the end of certain conflicts — particularly in Liberia and Sierra Leone — and while solutions are in sight to relieve the tensions in Guinea-Bissau, we cannot fail to express our concern over the crisis in the Great Lakes region, the resumption of hostilities in Angola, the continuation of the crisis in Somalia and, finally, the armed confrontation between Ethiopia and Eritrea. 7 We cannot stress enough the advantages of dialogue and negotiation as the best paths to follow for settling disputes between States on the basis of respect for their territorial integrity. In that connection, the international community must put an end to the embargo imposed on Libya by implementing the jurisdictional solution accepted by that country and by ensuring a fair trial for the suspects in the Lockerbie bombing. Togo firmly supports the efforts of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to settle this dispute and end the suffering of the Libyan people. My country takes this opportunity to repeat its steadfast condemnation of terrorism in all of its forms and to emphasize the need for urgent and concerted action to combat this scourge effectively. As we are aware, the proliferation of conflict situations in Africa remains a real cause of concern for the international community. I would like to note in this regard the important report (A/52/871) presented by the Secretary- General last February at the request of the Security Council on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa. That report contains specific recommendations on means of preventing such conflicts and putting an end to them, as well as on measures to be taken to create conditions for lasting peace and economic growth. We hope that the implementation of his recommendations by the Security Council, by the relevant bodies of the United Nations system and by the Bretton Woods institutions will result in the effective prevention of conflicts and put Africa on the road to progress, stability and sustainable development. Elsewhere in the world, we were relieved to see the signing of an agreement between the Government of Iraq and the United Nations, which made it possible at the last moment to avoid a new confrontation in the Gulf. In the same region, my Government deplores the present deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. We remain convinced that only the resumption of direct negotiations between the principals will make it possible to usher in an era of peace, security and prosperity in that region. We were relieved to see the contacts that have taken place between Mr. Yasser Arafat and Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu through the mediation of the American Government. Togo strongly supports this initiative. With regard to the other crises that assail the world and jeopardize the lives of so many millions of people — particularly in Afghanistan and Kosovo — my country hopes that through firm political will backed by candid and sincere negotiations, the parties to the conflicts will find appropriate solutions that are acceptable to all. The world?s concerns at the dawn of the third millennium are not linked solely to the effects of the phenomenon of globalization. The preservation of peace, security and stability for States and peoples continues to be an important priority. In that context, Togo is gratified to note that the United Nations is continuing to discharge its mission of peacemaking and peacekeeping. In this regard, I welcome the upcoming commemoration on 6 October of 50 years of United Nations peacekeeping operations, and I would like to pay tribute to the memory of all the men and women who have given their lives in the service of the Organization. My country, which firmly supports the ongoing quest for peace and security for all, would like to emphasize the need to strengthen cooperation in this area, in a spirit of complementarity, between the United Nations and subregional and regional organizations, in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations. The appropriate regional machinery necessary to give concrete form to this shared desire for collective maintenance of peace and security should be established. It is in that spirit that Togo — together with other countries of the West African subregion and in the framework of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) — is working to establish a viable and permanent mechanism for the prevention, management and settlement of conflicts and the maintenance of peace. It is also within this framework that we welcome the fourth extraordinary summit of ECOWAS, held in Lomé from 16 to 17 December 1997, and the holding of the joint military manoeuvres named “Cohesion Kompienga ?98”, held from 16 to 21 April 1998, in which the armed forces of Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d?Ivoire, Ghana, the Niger, Nigeria, Chad and Togo participated. Among the goals of the United Nations are vigilance over the maintenance of peace and security, the establishment of conditions for harmonious economic development to ensure the well-being of our populations and working for a just world in which the rights of individuals and peoples are not only recognized and consecrated, but above all respected. My delegation would like to take this opportunity to hail the holding of the United Nation Diplomatic 8 Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court, which led to the adoption of the Statute of the court which was held in Rome from 15 June to 17 July. Togo believes that peace is impossible without justice. The struggle for peace and the struggle for greater justice must be viewed as two complementary aspects of one and the same struggle for the realization of the deepest aspirations of all the peoples of the world. The positive outcome of the negotiations at the Conference resulted in the adoption of the Statute of the court, illustrating anew the vigour and ability of our Organization in dealing with the present and preparing States to face the issues of tomorrow. It is for that reason that my delegation favours all efforts to reform the Organization that aim to make it more effective, more concerned with the problems of mankind and more democratic, so that the views of all are better reflected and taken into account in all of its bodies. Togo would therefore like to see the rapid conclusion of discussions to allow for the permanent representation of Africa in the Security Council, in accordance with the resolutions of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). The democracy we are advocating at the national level must also be reflected in international organizations. The United Nations has always played an important role in the advancement of economic and social development and, when necessary, in providing the men, women and children of the entire world with the assistance on which their survival often depends. We are nevertheless obliged to recognize that despite the efforts made, the improvement of standards of living, full employment and the conditions for progress and economic and social development have not been realized. This is particularly the case in Africa, where continued inequality and poverty, among other things, dangerously imperil the stability of States. It is true that African economies have performed remarkably well in the last three years; but it is also true that the consolidation of these gains still depends on the international economic environment. Global economic structural constraints — including the continuing burden of debt, the reduction in the flow of official development assistance, currency fluctuations, the inequality of investment flows, weak commodity prices and market protectionism practised by developed countries — still remain the major obstacles to the economic development of African countries. With regard to the debt burden in particular, my country highly values the declaration of the eighth consultative meeting of the Organization of African Unity, the African Development Bank and the Economic Commission for Africa, which was held in Abidjan in January 1998. We believe that the efforts to alleviate the debt burden must be continued in conjunction with Africa?s partners in order to find appropriate solutions to this thorny problem. In this context, Togo would like to reaffirm the imperative need to hold an international conference on Africa?s foreign debt, and it requests the support of the international community to translate that proposal into reality. Regrettably, at this time of economic globalization, the marginalization of Africa in terms of international trade is accelerating, even though today the development of trade appears to be the most effective means of managing the resources necessary for self-sufficiency. Indeed, the development and economic growth of African States requires as a basic condition sufficient currency inflows from the export of their commodities. Thus, in the view of my delegation, an open world system operating under just and equitable regulations should be established in order to ensure the active participation of African States in international trade. To that end, more liberal measures will be required in order to promote the transformation and diversification of their products as well as to attract and channel investments towards them. The industrialized countries are attempting to join forces. This shows clearly that today no country, regardless of how powerful it is, can alone provide for its own economic growth and cope with increasingly aggressive international competition. Given this state of affairs, the African countries have in recent years reaffirmed their will to pool their potential by establishing and strengthening subregional units. It is clear that the development policy of our countries must be considered within this framework, for this is the only way that Africa can become a fully fledged and reliable partner in the world of the twenty-first century. In this respect, the entry into force of the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community serves as a good illustration of the will of African States to unite their efforts to ensure their own progress. 9 Togo, which is firmly committed to the policy of economic integration of the continent, wishes to take this opportunity to once again urge the international community to support the efforts of the African countries to achieve the goals of sustainable development which alone can promote prosperity and the well-being of their peoples. I should like here to underscore an emerging trend in Africa: inter-African parliamentary control of the activities of our regional and subregional organizations. It is in this framework that an inter-parliamentary committee of the West African Economic and Monetary Union was created recently in Bamako; its work is already under way. Also in this framework, a parliamentary assembly was established in the countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), in southern Africa. This shows that while, generally speaking, people tend to despair of the future of Africa, we young Africans have faith that Africa is on the right path as long as we have the unswerving support of the international community. Here I should like once again to welcome the commitment of the Japanese Government to Africa through the Tokyo Conference on the Development of Africa (TICAD), aimed at seeking solutions to the continent?s development problems. My delegation would like here once again to thank the Japanese Government for all of its efforts to strengthen cooperation between Africa and Asia, and congratulates it on the convening of TICAD II next October in Tokyo. Moreover, Togo believes that the combination of TICAD with other initiatives — in particular that of the United States on equitable partnership, known as 20/20 Vision; that of the European Union, within the framework of the Lomé Convention; and that of the francophone world, within the framework of the Hanoi Plan of Action — will help safeguard and consolidate the spirit of solidarity, which Africa wishes to see ever more active and ever more purposeful. My country is convinced of the need for solidarity among the Members of our Organization and is deeply committed to the noble ideals of peace, freedom and justice and of economic, social and cultural progress, which the United Nations has contributed to advancing. During this year of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Togo fervently hopes to witness the realization, for the benefit of all humankind, of the profound aspirations of peoples to greater freedom and to a world of peace in which the struggle against poverty, famine and illness grows is daily strengthened.    Today’s world offers one clear lesson: to survive and prosper, we have to work together better. That much is clear. We share a global environment. We depend on each other for development and prosperity. Regional conflicts affect us all. Our peoples suffer together under the shadows of drugs and terrorism. We can no longer separate what we want to achieve within our own borders from what we face across our borders. Rapid change of the sort we have seen recently can inspire fear. But we must face and conquer that fear together. And if our finance, our trade, media, communications and even our culture are, day by day, more and more transnational, it would be strange and potentially dangerous if our politics remained locked in the old compartments built just after the Second World War. If the challenge is international, then the response must be international too. We must launch a new era of international partnership in which we modernize those institutions that allow us to cooperate and to work together. The United Nations has a real record of achievement. That is true. But it is true also that it has had its failures. It has stood by or intervened ineffectively when brutality was abroad. It has sometimes delivered words when action was needed. But the United Nations is no more than its Member States. Its failures are our failures. The values of the United Nations Charter are as valid now as when they were written. But we have to find new ways of applying them. So I believe in the United Nations, but I also believe it must modernize, and do so urgently. All parts of the United Nations need proper accountability to go with secure funding, better management and more effective coordination in all their activities. Our Secretary-General has given us a lead. But it is now up to us, the Member States, to give him our full support. We must not allow reform in the United Nations to falter. And let me emphasize today that we need to strengthen too the authority of the Security Council. This means broadening its composition: new permanent seats — for the developing world as well as for Germany and Japan. More non-permanent seats alone would be an unacceptable compromise. We have been talking about this now for five years. It is time for decisions. 28 We face many challenges, but none more immediate than the contagion of recession spreading from those countries currently in difficulty to affect the wider world economy. The solutions do not lie in misguided attempts to impose new panoplies of controls on international capital movements, or in a retreat from open trade. Rather, we must all recognize that the absence of proper financial structures and disciplines in individual countries, coupled with a lack of transparency, will be punished by the markets sooner or later. However, we can act. We can devise new mechanisms to support a process of change: rules to encourage greater transparency in international and national financial dealings; better supervision and regulation of financial operators; adequate resources for the international financial institutions to deal with short-term liquidity problems; structural reform programmes for countries in difficulty, programmes that take account of the social effects of the restructuring we are asking for. The only way to tackle such complex problems is a new, high-level, international collaborative effort. Global problems will require global solutions. As Chairman of the G-8, Britain will play our full part in ensuring the necessary look at the international financial architecture and how it can be improved for a new age. This is a priority, I believe, for us all. However, we know that, unlike in the 1950s, this cannot be left simply to a few developed countries. Getting the financial framework right is only a start. We must create the conditions for sustainable development in all our countries. The international community has set itself exacting targets. Most important is the target to halve the proportion of people living in abject poverty by the year 2015. Our own development effort is now geared to the eradication of poverty. I told last year’s special session that we would reverse the decline in our development assistance. Recently we have announced that we are raising our development budget by £1.6 billion, and our support for health, education and water projects in Africa by 50 per cent. We have helped pay for the World Health Organization’s campaign to roll back malaria. We are trying to put our money where our mouth is. Of course, however, these development programmes only work if the conditions are right, and too much money has been wasted over the years. That is again why the work the United Nations is doing to create strong development partnerships is so important and must be given our full backing. I call today on all parts of the United Nations system, including the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization, to give top priority to effective coordination of their development efforts. The poor of this world will otherwise be the losers. If we want to eradicate poverty, we also need to ensure that the least developed countries benefit from this global economy. That means, for example, letting them sell their goods without imposing tariffs on them. It means actively helping them benefit from globalization. And it means rejecting any false allure of protectionism. The European Union is committed to zero tariffs for these countries by the year 2000. And I would urge all developed countries to follow suit. We also have to ease the debt burden on the poorest countries. Britain has proposed the Mauritius Mandate to speed up assistance for those in the debt trap who are genuinely ready to help themselves out of it. By the year 2000 all qualifying highly indebted countries should have embarked on a systematic process of debt reduction, with the aim of a permanent exit from their debt problems. But we need to make sure it happens. Again, a huge collaborative effort between the countries represented here today will be needed. Development must not be at the expense of the environment. We all know this. But, again, this is a challenge to us. The success of Kyoto was a close-run thing. Buenos Aires will be hard work, but it has to work. Countries with the biggest emissions must come forward quickly with credible plans to meet their Kyoto commitments. We in Britain will shortly publish a consultation paper on how we will meet our obligations. And I hope that others will come forward and do the same. The world has high expectations of the United Nations as the guardian of global peace and security. The United Nations should not get involved if regional organizations are better able to tackle a local conflict. But sometimes we must demonstrate collective global will. And if we act, we must act decisively. Clear principles must be our guiding hand. Let me set some out briefly. First, prevention is always better than cure. The resources spent on averting conflict are tiny compared to the expense of peacekeeping once the guns start to fire. The United Nations is building up its capacity in this 29 area, but it needs more support — and again Britain pledges to play its part. Secondly, where we do have to send in the Blue Helmets, they should be given a clear and achievable task. There must be no repeat of Bosnia, where peacekeepers were inserted into a live conflict and told to make safe areas safe. But they were not given the means to do so. United Nations peacekeepers need a way out as well as a way in. They must have the tools to do the job, and clear and effective command. Thirdly, the United Nations needs to be able to act and respond fast. Fast action can prevent a conflict escalating, underpin a fragile truce, save lives. Again, we in Britain are trying to play our part. The reshaping of Britain’s armed forces following our Strategic Defence Review is transforming our ability to contribute to peacekeeping and humanitarian operations: more and better equipped rapid- reaction forces, additional strategic lift and better logistics capability. I can announce today that within six months we will conclude a specific agreement with the United Nations to ensure that it can make rapid use of what we have to offer when it is needed — the first such agreement by a permanent member. Fourthly, peacekeeping has to be accompanied from the start by peace-building, to restore justice, democratic institutions, prosperity and human rights. The Security Council has to deal with the symptoms of conflict, not simply with its causes. It needs to work with the rest of the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund if it is to have lasting impact. Again, I will be asking the Secretary-General to put to us new proposals dealing with the consequences and the causes of conflict to make this a reality. Too many of those conflicts sill abound. There are few higher priorities than restoring peace to the Great Lakes region. The Middle East peace process remains an apparent deadlock. We have managed to make progress in Northern Ireland, and the support of the world community in our doing so has given us great strength and courage to carry on. We owe a debt of gratitude for that support, and I hope that the world will continue it. I believe now is the time for a further move forward in the Middle East, too. Again, we in Britain are ready to play our part in bringing this about. I want to focus, however, on one other area of urgent concern: Kosovo. It almost defies belief that, yet again, the security forces of President Milosevic´ are ignoring the clear will of the international community and inflicting brutality and repression on those they claim to see as fellow citizens. Of course, we recognize that the unacceptable actions of the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army have contributed to the present appalling situation. But nothing can justify scorched-earth tactics and forcible creation of hundreds of thousands of refugees. We have some clear responsibilities in this situation as an international community. First, we must make it clear that our patience with broken promises — phoney assurances that are not honoured — is exhausted. Continuation of military repression will inevitably lead to a new kind of response. Secondly, we must impress on both sides the need to negotiate, with a realistic appreciation of what is possible, and point the way to a mutually acceptable solution. Thirdly, we must make it clear that we have to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of the refugees in Kosovo and prevent, by any means necessary, the humanitarian disaster which we can see just over the horizon as winter approaches. We propose a new Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire and demanding an urgent end to the trampling of the rights of the inhabitants of Kosovo. It should be adopted this week, and President Milosevic´ would ignore such a resolution at his peril. The international community faces another serious challenge in Iraq. The Security Council is unanimous in insisting that Iraq resume cooperation with the United Nations, and Kofi Annan courageously reached an important agreement with the Iraqi leadership about the United Nations Special Commission earlier this year. Again, this agreement has to be honoured, and we will play our part in ensuring that it is. Finally, we face two global scourges which can undermine our institutions and, indeed, our way of life: drugs and terrorism. We all know the growing links between drugs and crime and instability in so many countries. The insidiously corrupting effect drugs have on all who come near them — growers, smugglers, pushers and users alike. We have, as we know, to tackle every link of the drugs chain, but we are in danger of losing sight of the size of the mountain we have to climb. If we are honest with ourselves, this is a war that we are risking losing, but we must win. Britain, again, is spending a 30 further £200 million at the national level on our priorities, but our collective efforts need a much stronger focus. We are not short of organizations looking at this problem; indeed, there may well be too many. But we are desperately short of results: cutting supply lines, eliminating illicit crop cultivation and stopping the profits of the drug dealers. We have a new instrument, the convention against organized crime. Too many countries still provide sanctuary for the proceeds of crime. We must demand together that those countries root out the traffickers and their dirty money — hit the drug barons where it hurts. The convention will provide practical means to achieve this, but the negotiations are dragging. Let us set ourselves the task of completing them by the millennium, at the latest. The fight against terrorism has also taken on a new urgency. The past year’s global roll-call of terror includes Luxor, Dar-es-Salaam, Nairobi, Omagh and many others. Each one is a reminder that terrorism is a uniquely barbaric and cowardly crime. Each one is a reminder that terrorists are no respecters of borders. Each one is a reminder that terrorism should have no hiding place and no opportunity to raise funds, and that there should be no let-up in our determination to bring its perpetrators justice. This applies to the new phenomenon of stateless terrorism as much as to its more familiar forms. As a start, it is surely vital that all countries sign up to the 11 international conventions to ensure that terrorists have no safe haven. We have ourselves, again, in Britain, just passed new legislation to ensure we can tackle terrorist conspiracies aimed at third countries. But we must go further. We can hope to defeat terrorism only if we all devote ourselves to doing so. So I welcome the recent initiative by the President of France to tackle fund- raising for terrorism on an international basis. As Chairman of the G-8, I again offer today to host a high- level conference in London this autumn to deny the terrorists this means of support. Effective new measures on an agreed international basis could make a real difference. I have covered many points in my speech to the Assembly, but my main point is really a very simple one. We face multiple new challenges as we approach the new century. Our only hope, as we all know, of tackling these challenges successfully is tackling them together. We need effective international cooperation and modern institutions to deal with our political problems and our economic problems. We need the United Nations system pulling together as never before. We need to revitalize and modernize our international institutions to deal with the crisis in the global economy. But, above all, we need political will and a sense of urgency. The problems of our modern world are too pressing, their consequences too immediate, their impact too far-reaching for us to hesitate or to look away any longer. We are being given a warning to act, to give purpose and direction in resolving these challenges we face together, or pay the price. And the time to do it — to respond to that warning — is now.Allow me first of all, on behalf of the delegation of Mali, to extend to Mr. Didier Opertti my very warm congratulations on his outstanding election to guide the work of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. To ensure the success of the lofty mission entrusted to him, I wish to assure him that he will have the full and open cooperation of my country’s delegation. I would also like to congratulate his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, President of the General Assembly at its fifty- second session, for the skill and ability with which he guided our work at a time when the reform of the United Nations occupied a prominent place on the agenda of our Organization. I also take this opportunity to convey to Secretary- General Kofi Annan and his team all our gratitude for their tireless commitment in the service of the ideals of the United Nations. The delegation of Mali fully appreciates his programme of reforms designed to adapt our Organization to the changing realities of the world. The fifty-third session of the General Assembly has opened at a time when the growing impoverishment of 13 the poorest countries, the resurgence of hotbeds of tension and the difficulties incumbent in a stronger and more united cooperation are demonstrating that the rhythm of international change is unprecedented and requires our Organization’s attention. Indeed, it would now appear that increased interdependence and the globalization of the economy are contributing heavily to the rise of new tensions and creating profound imbalances for the developing countries. The entire world, under the yoke of the logic of extreme competition, is going through a phase of profound confusion. Everywhere, North and South, workers live under the remorseless threat of market rules, which grow murkier and more pitiless every day. Financial crises are likely to undermine the developing countries’ efforts at economic reform. The imbalance between North and South is being exacerbated, the gaps are widening and differences becoming entrenched. Characterized by a disparity in income, access to services and the possibility of living in dignity, poverty is growing in the developing countries and even spreading within the developed world. My delegation certainly believes that, if genuine social development and poverty reduction are to be achieved, strong economic growth is necessary and that the poorest countries must have access to markets in order to better participate, on a sustainable basis, in the world economy. In this respect, we welcome the Secretary-General’s suggestion that the developing countries be encouraged to participate more actively in the drafting of new international standards and in ensuring that these standards be transparent. Specifically, non-tariff barriers should be eliminated for African and the least developed countries; vigorous measures should be adopted to ease the debt burden, whether by converting the public debt of the poorest countries into grants or by easing access to the Debt Initiative for the heavily indebted poor countries. But let us make no mistake: what is truly at stake today is a globalization focused on sustainable human development. The challenge at the end of this century and into the twenty-first will be to close the gap between North and South. In this respect, as the highest authorities have said; we are convinced that the history of humanity is the history of men. Our constant quest for man is our roadmap for the world’s progress. Our struggle will always be against a blind global market and in favour of sharing and solidarity. Let us have economic growth, by all means, but let our work and its fruit be shared so as to end these inequalities. Let us not close our eyes: Where there is injustice and iniquity, there is no peace. Respect for human and national rights is an integral factor for economic prosperity and social equity, as well as for promoting and maintaining peace and security. We can achieve such respect and right such imbalances if, through a renewed political dialogue undertaken in all responsibility and candour, we tackle the challenges with global vision and solidarity, in the conviction of true partnership and shared and equal responsibility in the building of a better world, a world of humanity. In this context, the major challenge facing the Government of Mali today is achieving sustainable human development through the struggle against poverty. This development hinges on a strengthened process of democratization, the rule of law and the implementation of decentralization, the vehicle for local development, designed and guided by the people. Mali is rigorously pursuing a freely agreed policy of economic reform and entrenching its democracy. The positive results of these efforts, though fragile, are very encouraging, but there remain problems and difficulties which our programmes — howsoever participatory — will require major outside assistance, peace and stability in our subregion, Africa and the world to solve. The same holds true for many countries, especially in Africa, which, through the courageous reforms they have undertaken, are once again on the road to economic growth. Like them, we intend to continue and consolidate our economic reforms with strong growth aimed at poverty reduction. The international community, however, must reverse the trend towards decreased official development assistance, which is essential to our basic minimum needs. We pay tribute to the tireless efforts of the United Nations system and our development partners and urge an increase in official development assistance, without which we will scarcely enjoy the benefits of our reforms, undertaken with so much sacrifice in the fight against poverty. We also need a partnership aimed at strengthening our economic capacities to convert and market our commodities, facilitating their access to markets, promoting the resurgence of our private sectors and increasing flows of direct foreign investments. All this must take place in a more favourable economic 14 environment if unemployment and poverty are to be consistently reduced. The end of the cold war transformed the international context for United Nations missions and activities. In the sphere of international peace and security, our Organization is now taken up with domestic conflicts that often have serious international repercussions. Unfortunately, in many cases, recent events allow us to assume that this type of conflict will continue to claim our attention. Now that certain guiding principles in the area of peace and security are widely accepted, it is quite obvious that peacekeeping will remain our priority objective. It is therefore essential that we improve our preventive system and strengthen our institution’s capacity to organize and lead these operations efficiently and successfully. For its part, Mali will always fight for more peace, justice and solidarity throughout the world. For us, security and development are indissoluble. The grave crises shaking the world, and Africa in particular, strengthen our conviction that the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the subregional organizations must cooperate closely with one another in the search for effective early warning, conflict prevention and management, and peacekeeping mechanisms. In this framework, and with particular reference to Africa, the prevention of conflicts and disarmament are of great concern. Given all of the challenges of democracy, development and security that Africa must meet, President Alpha Oumar Konaré of the Republic of Mali said a few weeks ago that: “The development of the continent must be managed on new terms. The difficult situation of our continent has arisen almost everywhere as a result of democratic failures, which we must redress in our young and fragile democracies by an essential democratic commitment. We must promote pluralistic expression, the transfer of power and dialogue founded on law. We must eschew violence. “The future of our continent does not lie in the emergence of ethnic republics, which will only lead us into general anarchy. It is important, we feel, not to deny, much less crush expressions of autonomy. They must be managed politically in a democratic context of the basic transfer of power and the emergence of local power with a view towards regional integration. “Thirty-eight years after the independence won in 1960, there is no question of redrawing the borders inherited from colonialism, but nothing today can justify border conflicts. We must be able to settle all border disputes politically. It is essential today that any ill-defined border be corrected in serenity, not in the heat of tension. The OAU’s Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution should be able to speed that forward. “At a time when everyone is welcoming integration, borders must have a different meaning. They must be managed as border countries, joint areas and shared space.” President Konaré also said that: “Post-election periods are also increasingly becoming times of conflict. This must be prevented by the proper preparation for elections, because some recent incidents of electoral challenge have threatened democracy. People must know that the only access to power is through the ballot box, whence all legitimacy flows. Everyone must participate. “We must therefore seek to control electoral challenges without ever endangering pluralistic expression and the transfer of power. Strength must always reside in law and right — the whole law and right and nothing but law and right — and oppose any impulse to disorder and violence.” In the view of the President of the Republic of Mali, “Africa can no longer be managed as it has been since 1960. A new Africa is on the move, an Africa which wishes to define its future and take responsibility for its own development; which is searching for solidarity, not alms; which is responsible and confident. It is an Africa once and for all on its own feet, a democratic Africa.” That Africa more than ever needs security and peace. To have that security and peace, Africa must, like the rest of the world, be free from weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons, particularly light weapons. With regard to disarmament, Mali hails the decisions of the Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), in particular on the Treaty’s permanent extension. 15 We also hail the entry into force on 29 April 1997 of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the progress in negotiations regarding the Biological Weapons Convention. We warmly welcome the coming entry into force of the Convention on anti-personnel landmines. Mali, which ratified this Convention early on, began last May destroying its stocks, which Mali’s army had never used. While welcoming also the notable progress made on instruments regarding weapons of mass destruction, Mali is deeply concerned about conventional weapons, which remain an area so far unexplored and not subject to international norms. Recent conflicts, particularly in Africa, which have claimed so many human lives, are fuelled not by weapons of mass destruction, but by light weapons. That is why my country, together with the United Nations and the countries of the West African subregion, has undertaken specific initiatives to counter this phenomenon. We are pleased by the welcome given to President Konaré’s initiative regarding the moratorium on the import, export and production of light weapons by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and more recently by the Organization of African Unity during the Ouagadougou summit and by the Non-Aligned Movement at the Durban summit. But it is important now to go further to reduce and contain the threat of the proliferation of light weapons. This moratorium is in essence a confidence- building measure, aiming over the long term to strengthen the ability of the Governments involved to exert stricter control over the illegal traffic in light weapons. Here we wish to pay tribute to the far-sightedness and responsible commitment of the ECOWAS countries, which plan to announce a moratorium soon. This will be a precedent demonstrating Africa’s clear will to prevent conflicts by exerting pressure on the means which incite and fuel them. The international community must keep up the momentum by mobilizing around the issue of light weapons, supporting the moratorium and making it effective by implementing a programme of coordination and assistance for security and development, which underpin the moratorium and help to widen it. We are an active party, and we support the proposals that emerge daily for tracking the illegal traffic in light weapons and establishing a control mechanism. Although it is a complex and difficult matter, we must work together energetically to perfect such a mechanism. There must be more support for resolution 52/38 C, regarding assistance to States for curbing the illicit traffic in small arms and collecting them, and States must demand more on this issue of the international community and the United Nations, which we congratulate on the action already taken. We must show our commitment to make vigorous progress in creating a mechanism to curb this matter and, at the same time, actively support initiatives such as the moratorium, consciousness-raising and the mobilization of all State and non-State actors to better ensure peace and reduce the threat posed by this illegal proliferation to people, particularly women and children, and to States and democracy. On behalf of the delegation of Mali, I would like once again to voice our solidarity with and compassion for all the peoples of the world who are still living in conflict situations. Regarding the Middle East, we are deeply concerned over the deadlock in the peace process and the policy of fait accompli aimed at changing the religious, civil and historic character of the Holy City of Al-Quds. The agreements concluded on the basis of “land for peace” must be implemented. We reaffirm our unswerving support for the just struggle of the fraternal Palestinian people to realize their legitimate right to self- determination and to establish an independent State. We remain convinced that in Angola scrupulous respect for the Lusaka Protocol is the only path to lasting peace and reconciliation. I wish once again to honour the memory of Matre Alioune Blondin Beye, Special Representative of the Secretary-General, and the seven members of his team who tragically perished on the road to peace in Angola. We have continually voiced our grave concern about the suffering of the fraternal people of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya as a result of the embargo imposed on it. While noting recent events, we should like to recall the decision taken by the heads of State or Government of the OAU at their recent summit and to reaffirm that the time has come to end the suffering of the fraternal Libyan people by lifting the embargo and finding a lasting solution. Concerned about acts of terrorism, which we condemn in all its forms, Mali firmly condemned the lethal attacks against diplomatic missions of the United States in Dar-es-Salaam and Nairobi. We reiterate our condolences to the families of the victims and call for greater international cooperation to prevent and combat this threat. We also call for the convening of an 16 international conference on terrorism under the aegis of the United Nations, whose exclusive competence in the area of international peace and security we need increasingly to reaffirm. I would like to conclude on the issue of the expansion of the Security Council. Clearly this body, which was conceived in a context quite different from today’s, cannot be left untouched in the course of reform. My delegation endorses the demands of Africa for democratization and an equitable distribution of the two categories of seats, permanent and non-permanent, with all the prerogatives and powers that go with them. We are convinced that a restructured United Nations, democratic and given essential powers, can help ensure a more orderly management of world affairs by eliminating the injustices, disparities and selfishness which threaten mankind, so that nations can finally, in a spirit of solidarity, devote their resources and their energy to the progress and development of mankind.  The election of the Foreign Minister of Uruguay as President of this General Assembly is very gratifying to our delegation and we are sure that his enormous talents and experience will guide us effectively through this critical session. We also wish to acknowledge the contribution of his predecessor for the admirable guidance he provided the Assembly over the past year. The inspired work of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has brought new life and meaning to the United Nations, and we are grateful to him for his dedication to the task of modernizing the Organization. The commitment to ongoing reform and renewal in this Organization and the new vision and energy injected by the Secretary-General have resulted in a revitalized institution that offers new hope. In like fashion, the Belizean people demonstrated their political maturity when they turned out in record numbers a month ago to elect a Government committed to setting a new and higher standard of governance to take them through to the next millennium. We regard the overwhelming mandate given to our new Administration as a directive to transform our institutions and political culture into more democratic, open and just instruments for the welfare of all our people. The work of reform and renewal is never-ending. With regard to the reform of the Security Council, while 16 we agree that this is urgently needed, we wish to urge all Members to make every effort to ensure that the Working Group produces a final package for the consideration of this Assembly. It is to the credit of the United Nations that many more people in today’s world benefit from a culture of democracy and the rule of law. The United Nations has set the pace in providing the support necessary to build and consolidate the institutions of democracy. Central to this achievement has been the fact that the economic, cultural and social aspects which underpin democracy have not been ignored. Perhaps the most powerful instrument for promoting democracy has been the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, whose fiftieth anniversary we celebrate this year. This basic document has been fortified over the years by other commitments relating to second-, third- and fourth- generation rights and to the rights of children, women and indigenous people. Taken together, these commitments constitute a challenge which we are all called upon to live up to. Belize is committed to pursue policies that lead to an economic and social climate which nurtures the development of our children and offers real opportunities to our young people to be creative and productive and to develop self-respect, self-reliance and a sense of belonging to a community. Our Government recognizes the value of education in promoting gender awareness and improving the economic situation of women, upon whom poverty casts a disproportionate burden. Our policies for greater employment, education in non-traditional areas and microcredit facilities will all be driven by gender awareness to foster greater access and opportunity for Belizean women. The International Decade of the World’s Indigenous People has served to raise public consciousness of the plight of peoples who for centuries have been disadvantaged, exploited and marginalized. Our Government takes seriously its duty to tangibly improve the quality of daily life for indigenous people and will engage in respectful negotiations with them in regard to their concerns about land, natural resources and other matters. The United Nations decolonization programme has been hailed as one of the most successful of the Organization’s undertakings over the past decades. However, enjoyment of the fundamental right to self- determination is still denied to the people of Western Sahara and East Timor. Belize will continue to support the work of the Special Committee on Decolonization to ensure that these people are afforded opportunities for the full expression of their will. This year presents us with a telling irony: even as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights, we are painfully reminded that it is also the fiftieth anniversary of the dispossession of the Palestinian people. We continue to press for the full recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people to self- determination and to establish an independent State, respecting the independence and security of all the States in that region. We are likewise concerned about the fact that a sister Caribbean nation continues to suffer from a policy designed to isolate it, even as it continues to be the target of terrorist attacks. The most fundamental human rights of the Cuban people are thus being violated, and we urge all concerned to work together with us in Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and in the Association of Caribbean States to bring an end to this situation. Belize supports the efforts of the Republic of China on Taiwan to participate fully in the work of this Organization and its organs, as well as in international financial and developmental institutions. The time has come for us to respect the sovereign will of that population, in conformity with the universalist principles of our Charter. We all know that it is meaningless to talk about human rights without addressing the fact that millions of people are falling into poverty even as incredible advances in science and technology make possible the eradication of poverty. This tells us that something is terribly wrong about the way the world economy is managed. If some resisted this conclusion before, the instability of the present world financial markets is surely proof enough that unbridled globalization can have serious negative effects on developing and developed countries alike. We must move resolutely to create a new and fair management regime for the world economy. We support the proposed United Nations conference on financing for development, which should include consideration of social factors and should seek to bring about comprehensive reform of the international financial system. 17 I speak for a country which has seen its prospective base of prosperity whittled away over the past few years by misguided economic policies, predatory politics and financial mismanagement. Our Administration has inherited a country where some 40 per cent of the people live in poverty, where almost half of its children do not complete primary school and where preventable diseases and infant mortality are on the rise. We have committed ourselves to an intensive integrated programme aimed at the elimination of poverty, based on growth economics that will restore investor confidence, stimulate economic activity and employment and bring about more revenue for development. But the stark reality is that no matter how hard we try, we cannot do it alone. We are, therefore, especially encouraged by the words of the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, spoken to this Assembly a week ago, at the 7th meeting: “If we want to eradicate poverty, we also need to ensure that the least developed countries benefit from this global economy ... [by] letting them sell their goods without imposing tariffs on them ... actively helping them benefit from globalization ... [and] rejecting any false allure of protectionism ... We also have to ease the debt burden on the poorest countries.” In this connection, we emphatically endorse the call of the Durban Summit of Non-Aligned Countries for new concessional financial flows to debtor developing countries, in addition to debt cancellation and other debt relief measures. We are also witnessing progressive decreases in the amount of aid flowing to the developing countries. And too often we are victims of a trend in international agencies of spending millions on endless studies and consultancies, when what we need are concrete actions to solve the problems we long ago identified. We certainly welcome the work being done by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for the protection of our environment. Our population depends on its forests and clean seas to survive. The pristine condition of our natural resources affords us a competitive advantage as a prime destination for eco-tourism, and their rational management and use is the only guarantee for our sustainable development. Yet we have witnessed the wanton destruction of forests by transnational corporations and the depletion of marine life by galloping consumption that is heedless of the fragility of our ecosystems and of the social consequences. The 1998 Human Development Report concludes that gross inequalities in consumption have prevented over 1 billion people from meeting their basic consumption requirements, a conclusion which led the report’s coordinator, Richard Jolly, to call for patterns of consumption that are socially responsible, are not destructive of the well-being of others, are sustainable and do not degrade the natural resource base and environment for present and future generations. As if the uneven effects of the globalization of the world economy were not enough to try us, we are faced with the even more destructive phenomenon of the globalization of crime and mindless violence, especially as manifested through the increased use of and trafficking in drugs and money-laundering. My country is in the unfortunate position of being along the way of the transit trade to the country of greatest demand, and we daily suffer the consequences in the ruined lives of our youth and the increased incidence of crime. We are doing everything possible to fight this scourge of mankind and will cooperate fully with all regional and international efforts aimed at the effective curbing of the drug trade and its insidiously corrupting effects on our institutions and way of life. A world free of the curse of drugs, liberated from the affliction of poverty, blessed with freedom and democracy where people’s human right to a full and dignified life can be pursued in peace: this, surely, is what we are all striving for. Belize pledges to play its part in that glorious struggle, even as we ask the United Nations to continue to support the independence and territorial integrity of our nation, whose people, like human beings everywhere, seek only to assert their absolute and inalienable right to human dignity. In this search, we all need a vital and effective United Nations — this unique expression of our common humanity.  Singapore was delighted to see Mr. Didier Opertti unanimously elected as the fifty- third President of the United Nations General Assembly. As this century draws to a close, the world is experiencing dramatic changes. We live in an era of great uncertainties. At this crucial juncture, we are delighted that a distinguished man of letters and man of law from a fellow small State has assumed this distinguished office. We would also like to place on record our gratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his able stewardship of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly. In the last two decades, the world has changed. The growth of international institutions, cross-border trade and investment, the opening up of markets, the advent of instant communication — all these have altered the face of the world. From the Americas to Europe to the Middle East, to Africa and to Asia, no country has been untouched by the forces of globalization. The expansion of global economic activity has forced globalization onto the agendas of United Nations Members. At one point or another, we have all asked how our peoples could benefit from globalization and wondered how our nations could be better plugged into the global economic grid. Keen international interest at the United Nations about globalization was also evident from the active participation of many Member States in the high-level dialogue on the impact of globalization held last week on the fringes of the General Assembly. At that dialogue, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that there was no subject more important than globalization. I agree. The long-term benefits deriving from the free trade of goods and services and from the free flow of capital and information are generally accepted. In the last year the desirability of a freer flow of capital has been severely questioned. When the currency crisis erupted in South-East Asia, some expected the crisis to blow over quickly. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Economic problems quickly developed into full- scale social problems, which in turn became political problems. The crisis has since spread from South-East Asia to North-East Asia, Russia and even Latin America. Even as we speak, it laps at the shores of America and Europe. What started out as a national problem has ballooned into a regional problem, and it is fast threatening to become a global crisis. The United Nations cannot avoid coming to grips with globalization. Events in East Asia over the last year have caused enthusiasm for this phenomenon to give way to uncertainty about its value. The questions foremost in our minds are: is globalization good for us? How do we prevent ourselves from being hurt by it? We are all groping for answers. The challenge for us is whether we are able to draw the right lessons from recent events. On the whole, globalization has done a lot of good. The process has enhanced the free flow of goods and services, capital and information; it has spurred innovation and competition and has lifted hundreds of million of people out of poverty. East Asia has enjoyed two decades of unprecedented economic growth. Our landscape has been radically transformed. Financial centres have 14 replaced sleepy villages. Lifestyles which were a dream for our parents are a reality for us. Our cities are increasingly plugged into the world information superhighway. Less than 10 years ago, letters would have taken at least a week to cross the globe. Today, with the advent of electronic mail, it takes seconds. We can now chat “real-time” on the Internet. Initially, the Internet was used mainly in developed countries. Increasingly, it has spread its wings around the globe. Dialogue and cooperation between countries have improved as the countries found issues of common interest and more areas of interdependence. Isolated economies have joined hands to form regional economic groupings and to promote regional prosperity. Look how the globalization of information has helped the work of the United Nations itself. Today, anyone with a computer and modem can gain electronic access to over 360,000 official documents of the United Nations, dating back to 1947. The complete list of United Nations peacekeeping operations, including potential training programmes, is available on-line. More crucially, the Organization’s “Relief Web” provides situation reports on humanitarian relief efforts in disaster areas around the world, along with instant information on how individuals and Governments can contribute to specific humanitarian operations. One major force of globalization, the Internet, has tied all of us together, very much like a global family. But, like any man-made phenomenon, globalization inevitably creates some problems. Some countries have been made more vulnerable by the opening up of their economies to the global market. Control has now passed largely into the hands of thousands of money traders who can move billions of dollars across boundaries with a single click of a computer mouse. Effectively, there is now no real force that can stop them. As the former Chairman of Citibank, Mr. Walter Wriston, noted in a recent article: “When I started in the banking business, the total foreign exchange market in New York was only about $50 million. If the Federal Reserve called Citibank or Chase and instructed them to sell $10 million, an order that size could move the markets. Today, that market is $1 trillion and Central Bank intervention in foreign exchange becomes an exercise in futility.” In today’s CNN world, live images are transmitted from one end of the globe to another as events unfold. Perceptions can be changed, emotions stoked and confidence irrecoverably shaken within minutes. This exerts greater pressures on Governments, on businesses and even on peoples to respond, rationally or otherwise. The way ahead is not to turn our backs on globalization. This is no longer a viable or realistic option. To repudiate globalization will hurt our long-term growth prospects. It is vital to remind ourselves in this crisis that the tremendous economic growth that much of the world has experienced since the Second World War has been the result of the free trade in goods and services encouraged since the formation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1947. There is an overwhelming consensus among economists that we should continue to push ahead on this front, despite the fact that protectionism has once again reared its ugly head. If we try to turn the clock back and walk away from free trade, the impact will not just be domestic nor will it be merely economic. Domestic political pressures can find regional and international outlets. The prosperity resulting from open markets has provided a foundation for national stability and regional and global peace and security. If countries cannot get access to the raw materials, goods and services they need through peaceful and open competition, they will resort to other means. Economic rivalries can have political and military consequences. A return to global tensions cannot be ruled out, but we must avoid it. The core interests of the United Nations — the maintenance of peace and security — may be endangered. The only way forward is to find solutions to deal with the vulnerabilities created by globalization. At the domestic level, we must promote higher standards of national government by strengthening our regulatory and supervisory frameworks, improving corporate governance, increasing transparency and lessening government interference in market decisions. We need to put in place sound macroeconomic policies and build strong regulatory structures to make our economies more resilient. On the international front, the United Nations can play a leading role in the international effort to help countries reap the benefits of globalization. We should encourage the developed world to assume the primary responsibility for bringing the world out of this crisis. There should be greater dialogue and partnership between the developing and developed world to ensure that globalization benefits every country. Globalization should bring security and confidence, not greater vulnerability, to our people. 15 United Nations Members have a common interest in revitalizing and reforming the major multilateral institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the World Trade Organization (WTO). The United Nations, for its part, has prevented the scourge of another world war. The IMF, World Bank and WTO have overseen a great burst of economic expansion of a size never seen before in the history of man. Together with other key United Nations agencies, they have made significant contributions to development efforts and to poverty alleviation. However, recent developments have shown that these institutions have their weaknesses. They should be reformed, but not destroyed. So, we at the United Nations can play a constructive role in this process. As Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan said at the high-level dialogue recently, the United Nations has ”A unique and indispensable role to play. Our broad mandate, our universal membership and our ability to involve non-State actors all make the United Nations uniquely well equipped to help forge a global response to the crisis, which is global not only in the geographical sense, but also in the range of issues that it raises.” (A/53/PV.6) I am glad that one clear conclusion of the high-level dialogue on globalization was, as the Secretary-General reiterated in his closing remarks, the need for the United Nations and Bretton Woods institutions to now work together as equal members of the same team. In my view, we will also have to work together to deal with the new challenges which were not anticipated when the Bretton Woods institutions were set up in 1944. We stand at a critical juncture of international discourse. As we approach the twenty-first century, paradigms that have brought us wealth and peace in the last half-century are now being questioned. The temptation to take the easiest route — to close our doors on globalization — is very great, but the quickest route is not necessarily the right or best route. We can begin by holding full discussions on this issue. A good start was made at the recent high-level dialogue. Many good ideas have been raised. We should continue this process in order to come up with a global understanding of the challenges and to formulate a global response. I am pleased to learn that preparations have already begun for the Millennium Assembly in the year 2000. Many questions will certainly be discussed then, but I dare say that no question may be more pressing than the challenge of globalization.  Allow me first, Sir, to congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. I am sure that 5 your leadership constitutes a guarantee of continued success. At the same time, I would like to express my appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Udovenko, for his excellent leadership during the fifty-second session. It is a special pleasure for me to address the Assembly in this session, which coincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of the Human Rights. Although decades have passed, this document remains profoundly relevant to our world today. In fact, its standards continue to be an essential guide for evaluating the development and emancipation of human society. The Member countries of the United Nations should be proud of this document’s lasting legacy. While affirming the ongoing importance of the Declaration, I would like to stress the need for the UN’s system of values to undergo an ongoing harmonization with new challenges. In this framework, on behalf of the Government of Albania, I commend the efforts made under the leadership of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, in the process of reform of our Organization. We hail the positive results achieved so far, and encourage the United Nations to continue to respond concretely to the challenges of the twenty-first century. Nearly three weeks ago Albania once again attracted the attention of the United Nations due to the violent events aimed at striking a blow against the fragile democratic institutions that were under the process of restoration from the deep crisis my country passed through last year. Certain political forces that lost their power in last year’s free elections obviously encouraged the attack and occupation of the main State institutions. That attempt to overthrow violently the legitimate Albanian Government was condemned by the whole democratic world, which strongly supported the President of the Republic in his endeavour to reestablish the political equilibrium that had been deeply disturbed and to guarantee the normal and democratic functioning of State powers and institutions. We highly appreciate this, and thank the international community for the support offered to Albania during its difficult days, and we welcome the establishment of the group of Friends of Albania. We view this as an important instrument in our common efforts for the stability of Albania and the consolidation of State structures and institutions. We are conscious of the difficulties and negative phenomena with which we are coping. We are painfully aware that the civilian population of Albania continues to be considered the most armed in Europe. This is a reality which we have to face every moment. Taking into account the threat that this poses not only to Albania but also to the security of the region, our Government has appealed the United Nations for assistance in this regard. Allow me on this occasion to thank the Secretary-General for the seriousness with which he has dealt with this problem, and the Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs, Mr. Dhanapala, for the mission he led to Albania. I want to express our readiness to work together with the United Nations to collect the weapons which fell into the hands of the civilian population during the political unrest of 1997. I want to state that my Government is working diligently to establish the long-term rule of law in our country. Through lengthy deliberations among Albania’s political forces, we have made an extensive endeavour to draft a constitution that recognizes the need to share political power and to secure human rights. It is my sincere hope that by the end of this year the Albanian people will be able to express their views on the proposed draft constitution. The adoption of a constitution ratified by the people of Albania that recognizes the fundamental rule of law and protects liberties will prepare Albania for complete integration into international structures. Most important, this path offers the best and brightest hope for our country. I want also to address Albania’s economic situation. Rebuilding the economy has been the highest of priorities for the Albanian Government, especially since the fall of the pyramid schemes which led to widespread micro- and macroeconomic collapse and to the impoverishment of many Albanians. Our response to this crisis was direct and decisive: in exposing the deceit of the pyramid schemes, in closing down the pyramid structures and in rebuilding trust in the Albanian economy. In cooperation with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the assets of those firms were audited, and we initiated the process of returning liquid assets to legitimate creditors. Now I can declare with conviction that pyramid-scheme-based businesses do not exist in our country any more. We are working at present to create new, active policies for employment, self-employment and professional training. The task of rebuilding Albania’s economy constitutes a great challenge that requires the support of the 6 international community. The Government has worked diligently to break down Albania’s decades of isolationism and to become part of the world community of nations. The main directions of our policy so far have been the following. First, the engagement of Albania in Euro-Atlantic integration is aimed at the creation of acceptable national standards in accordance with the common Euro-Atlantic values of common security, human rights standards, and the promotion of the liberal market-economy policies. Secondly, Albania’s cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has also had concrete results, expressed in successful cooperation, in the framework of the Partnership for Peace, on the qualification of the Albanian army and police. The first Albanian company of peacekeepers has in fact made tangible progress in that direction. And thirdly, our cooperation with the European Union, the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has been further strengthened. It includes their assistance not only in the shaping and improvement of Albanian legislation, but also in monitoring the application of common standards. I take this opportunity to thank those institutions for their assistance and to express once again the willingness and the political commitment of our Government to raise the quality of this cooperation in the future. Albania’s cooperation with the European Union in the economic area remains a basis for multilateral cooperation. We consider membership in the World Trade Organization to be vital in furthering the liberalization of Albanian trading markets. In the meantime, we have strengthened our relations with international financial institutions, which have committed major financial resources to the economic development of Albania. On this occasion, please allow me to express my gratitude for the approval of the first United Nations Development Programme country cooperation framework for Albania, and my desire for the further strengthening of cooperation between Albania and the United Nations system. Albania now has serious and powerful partners for the development of our country. The Rome and Brussels conferences will be followed by another follow-up conference in Tirana, at which we will assess our progress and make new commitments for the future. Turning to matters of international policy, the Albanian Government has devoted much effort to regional concerns. Southeastern Europe has inherited a series of problems which are the political, economic, social, psychological and institutional legacy of the communist era. However, we are deeply convinced that there are ways and means to build up confidence, cooperation and friendship among the Balkan nations. Albania has embraced enthusiastically all the initiatives which cultivate peace and cooperation in southeastern Europe, such as the Central European Initiative, the Black Sea Economic Cooperation process, the South-East European Cooperative Initiative, the Royaumont Platform for Action and the process of Balkan cooperation. All these initiatives will contribute to transparency of borders, free movement of goods, people and opinions among the countries of the region, and the setting up of common values on trade, transport, energy, telecommunication and the environment that will lay down the infrastructure for stability and peace in the region. Towards this goal, we have worked on substantially improving bilateral relations with our neighbours. Significant steps were taken last year concerning relations with Italy, Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, on which a great number of cooperative agreements were signed. Close partnership relations have developed with Turkey, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, Slovenia, et cetera. Although I am underlining these positive and encouraging aspects of regional cooperation in general, and especially of Albania’s relations with its neighbours, we cannot ignore the fact that in the Balkans there still exist enclaves where fundamental human and national rights and freedoms, including the right to life, are brutally violated every day. I am, of course, referring here to the problem of Kosovo. I would like to confirm the conviction of the Albanian Government that during the past months of the Kosovo crisis, Belgrade has ignored the appeals of the international community to find an appropriate solution to that situation, and has systematically destroyed the alternative of a peaceful solution, thus encouraging the option of violence. Some days ago, the Security Council adopted its resolution 1199 (1998), attributing the main responsibility and blame for what is happening in Kosovo to the authorities in Belgrade. That resolution testified to unanimous political will on the part of the international community to act strongly to find a peaceful, political 7 solution to the conflict, and left open the option of using other means if failure is repeated. We hope that this time the clear warning given by Security Council resolution 1199 (1998), the Council’s strong message issued yesterday and the warnings given by the NATO and world leaders, will be the last ones necessary to impose a political solution on the authorities in Belgrade, something which they cannot realize by themselves of their own will. The political archives of Belgrade are quite rich with false manoeuvres and untrue statements. The so-called withdrawal of special Serbian police forces from Kosovo and the end of fighting against so-called terrorists is a new version of them. This is an old scenario of a Bosnian type, and we Albanians have ample reasons not to believe it. What is happening today in Kosovo is the story of a tragedy foretold. Milosevic´ has in fact ordered the implementation of his “ethnic cleansing” policy against Albanians under the pretext of combating so-called Albanian terrorism. This has so far proved to be a constant element of his strategy. In that way, Serbian propaganda has been trying to justify the indiscriminate attacks, massacres and atrocities of the Yugoslav army against the Albanian population of Kosovo, such as the ones seen lately in the media. Newborn children, pregnant women and elderly persons have been massacred in a bestial way. The Albanian Government strongly condemns this policy and openly declares that Milosevic´ should be held accountable and responsible for genocide. The Albanian Government urges the following. First, there should be strong and extensive international monitoring and assisting presence in Kosovo. The nature of this presence should be in accordance with the developments in the situation there. Secondly, there should be an immediate NATO military intervention for peace enforcement in Kosovo, as peaceful measures applied by the international community have so far failed. Thirdly, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia should start an investigation in accordance with her mandate in order to indict Milosevic´ as a war criminal. The current conflict in Kosovo, as rightly pointed out in the resolutions and presidential statement of the Security Council, may have a strong spillover danger. The neighbouring countries are directly affected not only by the wave of refugees, but also by its impact on the ethnic and political relations inside these countries. We have already been witness to these effects. Albania has made its position quite clear. We are in favour of an immediate end to the conflict and the initiation of negotiations between Belgrade and Priština with the international involvement of a third party. This would guarantee their success. The negotiations should define the future status of Kosovo. The Albanian Government strongly believes that any solution to the Kosovo crisis should take into consideration and respect the will of its inhabitants for self-determination in accordance with the relevant international conventions. Humanitarian problems have always been the focus of attention of our Organization, which has also gained valuable experience on how to deal with them. I would like to draw the Assembly’s attention to one the most acute developments which has already been the object of attention in United Nations bodies. Thousands of Kosovo Albanians — women, old people and children — have left their country and have gone as refugees to Albania, Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Hundreds of thousands of others are now homeless, driven to wander in the forests and mountains of Kosovo, constantly facing terror and death; and it is now almost winter. In spite of the known difficulties, the Albanian Government has taken all possible measures to cope with the difficult situation which was created as a result of the influx of Kosovo refugees in northern Albania. Albania, in cooperation with specialized agencies, has actually created suitable conditions to face the urgent need for food and temporary shelter. We appeal to these agencies to continue their assistance until this refugee crisis is resolved and Albanians can safely return to their homes. We are convinced that the United Nations and the Security Council will fulfil their responsibilities in accordance with the United Nations Charter in the efforts to overcome the Kosovo crisis, which in fact has become a crisis of the Balkans and Europe. It is high time the United Nations and other international forums urgently intervened for the restoration of peace; otherwise we risk having a wider conflict. On this occasion, I would like to thank the Security Council once again for the adoption of resolution 1199 (1998) and to commend in particular the initiators of that resolution, which constitutes an essential step in bringing peace to Kosovo and stability to the region. 8 Albania, like many other countries, is being affected by a set of phenomena such as drugs, illegal trafficking and organized crime. The Albanian Government has taken determined measures and is predisposed to cooperate with other countries to fight against these social scourges. We held a special session of the General Assembly this year devoted to the fight against drugs, as well as an open debate in the Security Council on children in armed conflicts. These efforts testify to the special attention paid to these social problems, and our Government hails them. We appreciate the debate held by the Security Council on Africa, the System-wide Special Initiative on Africa and the engagement of the United Nations system for peace and development in Africa, a continent with incredible natural and human potentials. My country also desires a peaceful solution to the conflict in the Middle East and the restarting of the dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians, in conformity with the relevant international agreements and resolutions of Security Council. We believe that the international community has often acted insufficiently in punishing the perpetrators of and the people politically responsible for crimes against mankind. Consequently, we appreciate the efforts made by the United Nations for the establishment of an International Criminal Court, and we consider this a process of strengthening the conscience of the international community, as well as a step forward in creating a collective positive reaction against such crimes. The Albanian Government is of the opinion that the institutional reform of the United Nations is an ongoing process which is affected by the ever changing real world. The United Nations will be better able to face the new challenges of the new millennium if the intergovernmental institutions of the United Nations become even more democratic in their structure. One key area of such reform is the Security Council. Albania follows attentively the proceedings of the Working Group for the restructuring of the Security Council and the efforts made to find a solution to this question. We are of the opinion that any decision to reform the Security Council should have the widespread support of member countries and must take into account the new realities that are occurring in international relations. The reform of United Nations, and especially of the Security Council, will be a reality only if there is a general will to provide the United Nations with the necessary political support. Only then will this Organization lead our world to the common goal of the creation of a global society of sovereign nations based on the rule of law, respect for human rights, personal and religious liberties, economic prosperity and international peace.  Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Opertti on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. I am fully confident that his experience and skill will ensure the success of the work of this session. The world continues to labour under events that attest to the inability of the international community to avert the effects of international transformations which carry within them the elements of tension and conflict, given the imbalance at the international level caused by a unipolar system wherein a sole dominant player in the international arena seeks to impose its hegemony on the international community. That sole player is not concerned except with its selfish and narrow interests, and with imposing its dominance over international institutions and organizations. As a result, the United Nations faces a serious challenge represented by the degree of its ability to regain the balance required of it in order to accomplish its objectives as set forth in the Charter. In this context, the United Nations witnesses attempts to reform its structures and work mechanism to make it compatible with the current political and economic realities. Most important is the effort to reform the working methods of the General Assembly and the Security Council in order to bring the work of these two organs into full harmony with the evolution of international relations and with the increased membership of the international Organization. This evolution requires equitable representation of States from the various continents on the Security Council, whether through permanent or non-permanent membership. The success of these efforts depends largely on the serious political will of Member States of our Organization. The reform of the work of the Security Council is urgently needed, if we are to end control over it by a few States and transform it into an institution which truly represents international realities. Without these reforms, it is impossible to achieve the purposes and the principles of the Charter with regard to the maintenance of peace and security, promoting economic and social development and strengthening cooperation among people. 13 International peace and security are affected by the irrational and biased character of the way issues of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, are addressed. There are States which maintain huge arsenals of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical, biological or long-range missiles, while other States are being disarmed or called upon to disarm themselves under all sorts of pretexts. The proper approach in this regard is in the comprehensive implementation of the relevant international treaties and comprehensive agreements, free of selectivity and discrimination. Then, and only then, can the goal of general and complete disarmament be put to the service of the cause of peace and security in the world and of ensuring the legitimate rights of States to defend their security and independence in a just and equitable manner. The Middle East region is witnessing today a grave situation and serious impairment of the balance of powers. The Zionist entity possesses a huge arsenal of weapons of mass destruction of all types — nuclear in particular, chemical, biological or long-range missiles — in disregard of the General Assembly’s efforts to render the Middle East a zone free of weapons from mass destruction; of Security Council resolution 487 (1981), which demands that the Zionist entity place its installations under the comprehensive safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency; and of paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution 687 (1991), which states that the actions to be taken towards Iraq represent steps towards the goal of establishing in the Middle East a zone free of weapons of mass destruction. This situation, resulting from the Zionist entity’s failure to comply with these resolutions, threatens security and peace in the region and in the entire world, and encourages an arms race in the region. Iraq strongly affirms its support for the struggle of the Palestinian people against Zionist settler colonialism in Palestine. It supports the struggle of the Palestine Liberation Organization for the realization of its legitimate objectives, endorsed by the international community, which affirms the inalienable rights of the Palestinians in Palestine, including its capital, Al-Quds al-Sharif. The comprehensive, inhumane blockade imposed on Iraq has entered its ninth year. This blockade has caused and continues to cause the death of thousands of Iraqi citizens every month due to the lack of medicine and food and a grave deterioration in the infrastructures of the industrial, agricultural, health, education, service sectors and other areas. This situation calls for the strong condemnation of those who insist, for ulterior political motives, on continuing to inflict on the Iraqi people this destructive blockade, the tragic consequences of which are tantamount to internationally proscribed acts of genocide. Security Council resolution 687 (1991) contains two sets of obligations: those which must be fulfilled by Iraq, and those that require the Security Council to lift the blockade on Iraq when Iraq has met its obligations. The obligations imposed on Iraq concern disarmament. Briefly, they require the destruction, removal or rendering harmless, under the supervision of the United Nations Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency, of all weapons of mass destruction which were in Iraq’s possession. They enjoin Iraq to refrain from the production, possession, stockpiling, use or development of such weapons in the areas prohibited by resolution 687 (1991), which are the ballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 kilometres and chemical and biological weapons, together with the nuclear programme. These obligations imposed on Iraq also provide for the establishment of a system of ongoing monitoring, verification and registration of compliance. In return for the achievement of the above, with regard to the elimination of the prohibited weapons, paragraph 22 of resolution 687 (1991) provides that the prohibition against the import of basic commodities and products originating in Iraq and the prohibition against financial transactions related thereto contained in Council resolution 661 (1990) shall cease to remain in effect. Throughout the past seven and one-half years, Iraq has fully cooperated with the Security Council, the Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iraq has met all the conditions and obligations imposed on it as an expression of its good will and in order to have the blockade imposed on its people lifted. All prohibited weapons have been destroyed over the past seven and one-half years, together with hundreds of plants, installations and equipment related to those weapons. The operations were carried out with so much vengefulness that they even included cooling and lighting equipment, as well furnishings and other items that had nothing to do with the prohibited weapons or with their production. Since 1994, the Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency have established a comprehensive system of strict monitoring. However, although Iraq has fully implemented all the requirements of resolution 687 (1991) concerning 14 disarmament, the Security Council has not taken any action to implement its own obligations towards Iraq, as prescribed by paragraph 22 of that same resolution. Questions which must be legitimately addressed to the Security Council are: why should Iraq bear all these burdens and losses while the blockade continues and no one knows when it is going to be lifted? Why has the Security Council been unable so far to discharge its obligations towards Iraq? Iraq has cooperated throughout the past seven and one half years with the Security Council, the Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency and has met all the requirements of the Security Council’s resolutions in the hope that its cooperation would lead to lifting the blockade imposed on the people of Iraq. However, the blockade has not yet been lifted, thus rendering the continuation of cooperation both meaningless and useless. The Special Commission entrusted with pursuing the implementation of Iraq’s obligations under the provisions of resolution 687 (1991), which concerns disarmament and directs the monitoring system established since 1994, refrains — I repeat, refrains — from reporting the facts about Iraq’s compliance with its obligations under Security Council resolutions. The reason for its failure to do so is political. The Special Commission and its Chairman operate under the influence of an arrogant, powerful State that is pursuing ulterior political aims against Iraq that have no relevance whatsoever to Security Council resolutions on Iraq. For political reasons, the Special Commission and its Chairman refrain from reporting to the Council that Iraq is totally free of all weapons prohibited under resolution 687 (1991) in the three areas of missiles and chemical and biological weapons, even though the Special Commission has no concrete evidence to prove the opposite. The Special Commission and its Chairman both refrain from reporting to the Council that all the plants, equipment and installations which the Commission itself determined had anything to do with those weapons have been destroyed and that the remaining plants, equipment and installations capable of so-called dual-use are totally under a comprehensive and strict monitoring system. Accordingly, Iraq is incapable of resuming the production of such weapons. Finally, the Special Commission and its Chairman refrain, also for political reasons, from reporting to the Council that since the establishment of the monitoring system in 1994 the Commission has not noted any violation on the part of Iraq with regard to resuming the production of the prohibited weapons. This prejudiced position on the part of the Special Commission and its Chairman has brought action to a dead end and into an unacceptable vicious circle. Iraq was therefore obliged to suspend cooperation with the Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency because insisting on dead-end paths and vicious circles can only lead to the continuation of the blockade on the people of Iraq, which is unacceptable and even contrary to resolution 687 (1991). In order to seek a way out of this deadlock and break out of the vicious circle created by the Special Commission and its Chairman, Iraq has welcomed the proposal for a comprehensive review submitted by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to the Security Council last 6 August. Iraq has emphasized that such a comprehensive review is a legal and moral obligation which the Council is duty-bound to discharge. By the terms of resolution 687 (1991), the Council is required to implement paragraph 22, relating to lifting the prohibitions against the import of basic commodities and products originating in Iraq, based upon the completion by Iraq of all actions contemplated in part C of the resolution. The Council is also required to undertake a review every 60 days aimed at either reducing or lifting the embargo in the light of the implementation by Iraq of all its obligations under the relevant Council resolutions. However, the 40 reviews carried out so far have been a mere formality, arbitrary and far from comprehensive. Thus, embarking upon a real comprehensive review in accordance with the Secretary-General’s proposal is not a reward given to Iraq, but a duty that the Security Council has to undertake under its own resolutions. Iraq has expressed its willingness to participate effectively in such a comprehensive review — it is one of its inalienable rights. Iraq has also expressed its hope that such a comprehensive review of what it has accomplished in terms of disarmament under part C of resolution 687 (1991) will be made as soon as possible and without further delay. It is our hope that it will be indeed comprehensive, fair and honest and that Iraq will be given every possible opportunity to submit its point of view on all relevant questions that might be posed by the Special Commission, the IAEA or members of the Security Council. Iraq also hopes that the review will be conducted under the personal supervision of the Secretary-General and that Mr. Annan will see to it that such a comprehensive review is bound by a clearly defined 15 timetable and not allow it to be an aimless process without foreseeable end. While we support carrying out such a comprehensive review in an objective, fair and impartial manner, we affirm Iraq’s right to expect the Security Council to proceed to take action to lift the inhumane sanctions that have been imposed on the people of Iraq for eight years now. The people and leadership of Iraq will accept no less.As previous speakers have done, I would like to convey to the President my sincerest congratulations on his election to the presidency at the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that our Assembly will benefit greatly from his sense of authority and leadership. I also wish to express my gratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his commitment and perseverance in conducting our work during the fifty-second session. The Secretary-General of our Organization is devoting tireless energy to opening up new avenues for our common efforts. He has emphasized the crucial importance of good communications to ensure that the United Nations will be a catalyst both for those directly involved in international life and for our peoples. We share that belief with him and encourage him in that respect. Last Tuesday, members heard the statement of Mr. Schüssel, President of the Council of the European Union. He spoke on behalf of all of the countries of the European Union, and Luxembourg fully supports the views expressed. 19 The presence of representatives of 185 States in this Hall reflects our common concern to ensure balance and security among nations, but also within our societies. Our concern is to ensure the permanence of values to which we are all committed in an ever-evolving world. In the context of its mandate to preserve international peace and security, our Organization regularly asks whether it has the means to ensure that the general interest, as perceived by our citizens, prevails. Surely, we must not be overly ambitious. We are aware of the complexity and the magnitude of the situations we face, and that these impose limits on our action. Therefore we must focus our operations and provide an appropriate framework for them. It is also our duty to acquire the means to act effectively whenever our ineffectiveness or slow response would seem to negatively affect the weakest among us. Luxembourg supports the efforts under way to provide our Organization with permanent structures and to make available to it forces prepared for rapid and effective intervention whenever the Security Council, guarantor of the preservation of peace and security, deems it necessary. Our common efforts to make our world safer suffered a serious setback following the nuclear tests recently carried out by two major countries in South Asia. We noted with satisfaction that the representatives of India and Pakistan have just announced from this rostrum that their countries are prepared to join the international community by acceding to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We invite them to proceed in that direction as quickly as possible. Will these efforts appear absurd, given the endless pursuit of the tragic discussion about the disarmament of Iraq? This spring the Security Council endorsed the memorandum of understanding submitted to it following the Secretary-General?s visit to Baghdad. Since then, such cooperation has been called into question. Such abrupt changes generate concern and discouragement and call into question the credibility of our Organization. It is the Security Council?s responsibility to take the necessary steps to ensure that its decisions in this area are fully respected. Our Organization is pursuing conflict prevention and peacekeeping. At the recent meeting between the United Nations and the representatives of regional organizations, the proposal for development of a culture of prevention was put forward. Progress has been made in the concept of mutually supportive institutions and on support for the initiatives taken at the regional and subregional level. While it is desirable to support such initiatives and efforts, we must remember that the Charter confers principle responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security on the Security Council and that the Council must fully play its role. We welcome the fact that in 1998 the Council once again authorized two peacekeeping operations, one in Sierra Leone and the other in the Central African Republic. The Ottowa conference on the prohibition of anti- personnel mines was undeniably an invigorating success in an area which constantly creates innocent victims. This treaty, which has just entered into force, will make it possible to save many human lives. The news that anti- personnel mines are again being sown in Angola and along the borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is terrifying. Such action, if confirmed, must be condemned vigorously. In Kosovo, the violence directed against the civilian population must end. It proves that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia continues to follow paths which cannot but compromise progress in its integration into international and European structures. Armed action conducted by Albanian groups in Kosovo must also end. The scorn for human suffering displayed by the Serbian leaders and the extremists in Kosovo is incomprehensible. A new status for Kosovo must emerge. It is inconceivable that such a status can emerge under the sway of threat or, even worse, cold-hearted implacable violence, which would merely drive the wedge deeper to the point where the very idea of understanding would be absurd. As Security Council resolution 1199 (1998) requires, a political solution must be negotiated between the parties under the aegis of the international community. Firm cohesion between Europe, the United States and the Russian Federation should enable those in the region, as was the case previously, to address their future in a more rational and orderly way. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the extremist tendencies are on the decline. This political progress was rapidly reflected in concrete results achieved in the field, and today this war-torn country is engaged in reconstruction. It is comforting to note that a growing number of individuals charged with war crimes have been sent to the Tribunal at The Hague. The establishment and the 20 functioning of the structures decided on in the context of the peace process are today becoming a reality. The recent elections have confirmed this new realism. It is up to the international community to consolidate this trend, as it still appears to be fragile, and to ensure, in particular, the return of refugees and displaced persons. This latter question is particularly acute in Croatia and Albania. Another key element for opening the way to a brighter future is a firm, unequivocal commitment by the regional parties and the international community. I refer to the peace process in the Middle East. Five years after the Oslo agreements, we must note the stagnation of the peace process, whose logic — the principle of land for peace — the current Israeli Government never really accepted. The archaic and paralysing philosophy of refusal has unfortunately returned to the foreground; it is reflected in many initiatives which only increase tension, thus nullifying the efforts of those who advocate peace. The political leaders involved must reverse this trend so as to return to the good faith implementation of all the provisions of the Oslo agreements. Our action, in that region and in others, must focus on convincing the parties involved that there is no alternative to peace. It is regrettable that this central concept is also being called into question in a number of African regions. Tribal rivalries and resentments continue to supplant clearsightedness and the desire for good governance. In no case should the political leaders involved in the different flashpoints feel that their only choice is between submitting to events and shirking their responsibilities. The struggles for influence and the war in and around the Democratic Republic of the Congo are on the verge of degenerating into a regional conflict and bringing about a humanitarian catastrophe there too. The causes of conflicts and the promotion of peace and sustainable development in Africa call for a united response. The debate at ministerial level that the Security Council has just held on these topics was very helpful. The General Assembly will have occasion to consider this question over the course of its fifty-third session, with a view to a discussion on possible measures. While the future of Africa depends first of all on the efforts of Africans themselves, the international community must be actively involved in order to ensure respect for international law, and in order to carry out its duty of solidarity. Recent events, with the terrible bombings perpetrated in Africa and Northern Ireland, remind us once again of the intolerable nature of terrorism. It is up to the international community to acquire an effective means of combating this scourge on an international level, and to ensure that the perpetrators of such acts answer for their crimes before the competent courts. We owe it to ourselves to put a definitive end to the culture of impunity in connection with terrorism. Another priority for our General Assembly is reform of the Organization. We welcome the fact that some progress was made during the fifty-second session. But reform cannot be an isolated event; it must become a process that underlies all of our action. We pledge to continue actively supporting the efforts of the Secretary- General, and to add our efforts to his, with a view to giving the United Nations the capacity to respond in a flexible and evolving way to the challenges of the twenty- first century. Any in-depth reform of the system will remain fragile so long as the Organization lacks sound and reliable financial resources. The grave financial crisis which the Organization has experienced for a number of years must be considered as a threat to the effectiveness of the whole. Our proposed reforms will be consolidated only when all Member States have agreed fully to meet their obligations under the Charter by paying their arrears to the United Nations, and by paying on time and unconditionally the full amount of their obligatory contributions, both to the Organization?s regular budget and to the peacekeeping budget. The maintenance of security and peace in the world cannot be dissociated from the international community?s efforts on behalf of development. When we see entire regions, even subcontinents, experiencing poverty and malnutrition, there is a shocking imbalance which will soon pose a threat to the security of the States concerned and to respect for the fundamental rights of the human individual. When we see that generations of young people can hope for no future but unemployment or a frustrating inactivity, there exists a flagrant and unjust imbalance which will be a source of conflict. 21 When we see social categories permanently deprived of education and health care, that, too, is an imbalance to which we cannot be indifferent. The economic, financial and social crisis currently besetting South-East Asia, Latin America and Russia has exacerbated this trend. Rationally, the international community must acknowledge that the means of intervention traditionally, and almost mechanically, employed to overcome economic crises have proved ineffective this time. In his work Civilisation matérielle, économie et capitalisme, Fernand Braudel pointed out the profound source of this crisis: “the emergence of a savage capitalism, as distinct from what we consider to be a market economy”. A market economy, and particularly a social market economy, cannot do without a stable State capable of regulating competition and protecting the weak. The strengthening or restoration of a democratic, working State in the countries in crisis seems to me to be an absolute priority. The international community cannot shirk the obligation to shoulder its responsibilities and lend a strong hand. It will do this not only because of its duty of solidarity, but because the interests of one and all are linked. Another area in which the interdependence of our objectives is particularly visible and tangible is that of the management of the world?s natural resources. It is clear that we need to be ambitious when it comes to the long-term management of our environment. Last year we met here in special session to undertake an initial evaluation of the implementation of the commitments undertaken at the Conference on Environment and Development a little over six years ago. At Rio de Janeiro and during last year?s evaluation session we defined the concept of a world partnership for sustainable development, a partnership respecting the fact that the protection of the environment cannot be dissociated from the economic and social development process. Undeniable progress has been made in recent years: the entry into force of the Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Convention to Combat Desertification. But it must be acknowledged that the world environment has continued to deteriorate. Accordingly, it is essential to accelerate the implementation of Agenda 21, the programme of action adopted in Rio de Janeiro. Luxembourg intends to shoulder its share of this responsibility. Accordingly, we have undertaken, in the context of the commitments made by the European Union at the Kyoto Conference, to reduce our emissions of six greenhouse gases to 28 per cent below 1990 levels by the year 2012. In the context of the Biodiversity Convention, we also plan to establish a national network of protected areas covering 10 per cent of our national territory. The goal of managing the world?s material resources as a good parent would reflect an atavistic concern, that of guaranteeing security through careful preparation for the future, in particular through suitable education. The recent Lisbon Conference devoted to the problems faced by young people rightly emphasized the need to provide training that is suited to the job market so as to prevent unemployment and marginalization. Such training must include education about responsibility. We therefore welcome the fact that the Lisbon Declaration commits Governments to ensuring the participation of young people in programmes that concern them. In that way we can come closer to democratic civic education based on the rights and responsibilities of citizens and on the participation of young people in civil society. Luxembourg has undertaken a long-term effort to make its own contribution to providing funds for development. Our efforts are aimed at attaining the target set by the United Nations of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance before the end of the millennium. Our efforts occupy an important place in the struggle against poverty, which is one of the main obstacles to development. At present our contribution is 0.56 per cent of gross national product and is equivalent to official development assistance of $195 per capita. According to those criteria, Luxembourg is fifth among donor countries in the Development Assistance Committee. Fifty years ago our Organization adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For the first 22 time, a universal organization declared its determination to place respect for human rights at the heart of international relations. Since then, we have made considerable progress towards ensuring recognition for the universal value of such rights and their effective enjoyment. Several international instruments have been added to the Universal Declaration so as to focus more precisely on what human rights represent and to ensure that the citizens of all countries of the world effectively enjoy these rights. Our Organization has established the post of High Commissioner for Human Rights, and concern for human rights now underlies all of its activities. This progress leads us to believe that human rights will find the central and permanent home at the heart of international life that they deserve. We also note that the Criminal Tribunals established by the United Nations to bring to trial those accused of crimes committed during recent wars in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda have recently been able to strengthen their authority and the scope of their action. This affirmation of their importance played a considerable role in the preparation of the Statute of the International Criminal Court. I sincerely welcome the positive conclusion of the work of the recent Rome Conference. At the same time, I should like to emphasize the fact that the entire international community has given that new institution strong and constant support. The end of the culture of impunity represents a decisive turning point in international relations at the end of this century. But this turning point will be convincing only if the Members of our Organization display a commitment to provide the new Court with the necessary credibility. In this commemorative year, we must ensure that our achievements are assessed in depth and that we avoid complacency in the field of human rights. Only in this way will it be possible to expand the base on which we can build the values that the international community has so often said it is prepared to ensure for humankind as a whole. I am confident that the United Nations will remain capable of steadfastly pursuing the attainment of the great objectives it has set itself: to serve men and women, ensure respect for their rights, preserve them from the scourge of war and lead them towards development and fulfilment. Luxembourg?s support will certainly not be lacking.   Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Opertti on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. We are confident that his vast experience and capabilities will lead this session to success. I would like to assure him of the full cooperation of my delegation. Allow me also to express our gratitude to his predecessor, the former Foreign Minister of Ukraine, for his commendable efforts and to express similar congratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and his able assistants for their efforts to ensure an improved performance by the Organization, to bolster its status and to achieve its lofty objectives. There are many questions in my country, in our Arab and African region, and in the rest of the world. There is a war raging between our neighbours on the eastern and southern borders. All of these questions need to be debated. The considerable improvement in the economic situation in the Sudan is reflected in the latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) reports, which indicate an increase in the growth rate and a reduction in the inflation rate. We expect the Sudan to become an oil- 30 exporting State in the next few months. This is an issue which we are very happy to brief you on. There is also the constitutional evolution and political openness in the Sudan, culminating in the approval by the Sudanese people in a referendum of a new constitution earlier this year. This will enhance the institutions of civil governance and the peaceful transfer of power based on a system of political pluralism. These developments are important to political stability in Africa?s largest country, the Sudan, a land of vast untapped resources. I also wish to talk about the humanitarian situation in the Sudan and the improvements in that situation. Sudan appreciates the efforts of the international community and expresses its full commitment to cooperate in the facilitation of these efforts. This is a matter which deserves further elaboration. There are also the peace efforts in southern Sudan and the positive response of the Sudanese Government to the calls for a ceasefire by the international community, including the Security Council, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the European Union. This ceasefire was rejected by the rebel movement, resulting in the continuation of war and more suffering for the citizens. This also is a matter which requires further elaboration. All these questions require more details, but I will leave that to other committees and forums, as I shall concentrate today on one single issue: the American aggression committed against my country on 20 August 1998. This American act, if not properly addressed, could undermine all the achievements made by our people through years of struggle and suffering. It would be appropriate to recall the events which began on 7 August. On that day the explosions took place in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. That same evening the Sudan condemned those heinous terrorist acts. We conveyed our condolences to the Presidents and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the United States, Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania. I also made telephone calls to my Kenyan and Tanzanian colleagues expressing Sudan?s fullest readiness to cooperate to the maximum possible extent in the efforts to search for, apprehend and punish the culprits. The American Administration requested fly-over permission for their military aircraft in order to evacuate the wounded and the dead from Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, and their request was granted. That was followed by another request for open fly-over permission for their military aircraft, to which we responded promptly and in good faith, as it was, in our view, a humanitarian request which deserved a response. Subsequently, contacts in this regard between the Sudanese and American security authorities were begun. We welcomed these contacts and gave assurances of our full cooperation. But, all of a sudden, within minutes and without warning, the Sudanese people were shocked on the evening of Thursday, 20 August, by a grave act of terrorism, as heinous and cowardly as those of Dar-es- Salaam and Nairobi. The “Al-Shifa” pharmaceutical plant, which only a few hours before that event was producing life-saving medicines for children, women and the elderly in the Sudan and which was a model of the economic development of my country, was completely destroyed. Some of the innocent Sudanese citizens, employees of the factory, lost their lives under the rubble, while others lost their sight, or some of their limbs, or were left swimming in blood. Families of the victims and the rest of the employees were suddenly bereft of the sources of their livelihood. A few minutes later, we watched the message of the American President on television, where he stated that the United States armed forces had launched air strikes against the Sudan and Afghanistan. He said that they had destroyed a plant in the Sudan linked to Osama Bin Laden which produced chemical weapons. This is the American perspective, which I have conveyed to you clearly. What then is the Sudanese perspective? I would like to state clearly and confidently that the factory produced medicine — and nothing but medicine. The plant belonged to the private sector. It was owned by a Sudanese businessman, and it had no link whatsoever with Osama Bin Laden. The factory was financed by the PTA Bank of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). It was one of the largest of its kind in the Middle East and Africa. In his speech at the inaugural meeting of this session of the Assembly, President Clinton spoke about the tolerance and greatness of Islam. We appreciate what he said and would like to add that Islam calls for mutual respect between civilizations, cultures and religions. Islam calls for dialogue — indeed, all the revealed religions call 31 for dialogue — and all of these religions abhor and renounce violence and injustice, because injustice begets hatred. All faiths call for justice. The principal rule of law stipulates that the accused is innocent until proven guilty. However, here we are faced with a situation in which the Sudan was accused by the United States, the Sudan was condemned by the United States and the Sudan was punished by the United States. Thus, the United States has acted as the adversary, the jury and the judge — the opponent and the arbiter. The whole world rejected the American aggression and its justification. Allow me to mention here some of those who supported our position in the Sudan: the Arab League, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), the Group of 77 and China, and large sectors of the American community, including former President Jimmy Carter, former Attorney-General Ramsey Clark, a number of Congressmen and the American mass media. Our position was also supported by high-ranking officials of Western countries, including presidents and foreign ministers, as well as by the British, Jordanian and American engineers who took part in the construction and operation of the factory and who continued their technical association with it until it was destroyed. A number of legal experts and lawyers from Western countries, as well as international trade unions and non-governmental organizations also voiced their support. In spite of this, the United States continues to oppose the dispatch of a fact-finding mission by the Security Council. The American officials claim that they analysed a sample of the soil near the factory and found that it contained chemical precursors used in the production of VX — a nerve gas. If they are so sure of what they found, we wonder why they object to the dispatch of a fact-finding mission by the Security Council so that the Council can be the judge. The factory has been destroyed, true; but the soil is still there and the remnants and the rubble of the factory are there. The fact-finding mission can easily collect soil samples and examine the machines, look into the documents and establish the facts about the output and ownership of the factory. This is the sole demand of the Sudan now. Last week the Group of Arab States presented a draft resolution to the Security Council. The draft does not seek to condemn the United States for its violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a Member State. It only requests the dispatch of a fact-finding mission to verify the allegations that were the basis of the decision by the United States to launch a strike against a medicine factory in the Sudan. It is the responsibility, indeed the obligation of the Security Council to do so. This is only a procedural measure to ascertain the facts — a procedure which the Council has always followed in similar situations. Therefore the Sudan and the entire international community call on the Security Council to send an urgent fact-finding mission to the Sudan so that the international community can verify the allegations upon which the United States based its decision to strike the medicine factory. The Sudan recognizes that sending a fact-finding mission is a legitimate request by a developing country that holds dear the principles of international legitimacy and believes strongly that the fight against terrorism, which we condemn in all its forms, whether committed by individuals, groups or States, must be based on the principles and channels of international legitimacy and cooperation and the renunciation of force as a means for hegemony and domination. We in the Sudan recognize that the United States is a super-Power, and we do not seek to involve ourselves in a confrontation or altercation with that super-Power. On the contrary, we are keen on establishing correct relations with the United States on the basis of mutual respect, common interest and constructive criticism. We are ready to engage in a dialogue with the United States and to cooperate with it on all issues of common concern. The people of the Sudan respect the American people and are eager to maintain good relations with them. It is incumbent upon the two Governments to work on reflecting this desire and to strengthen these historic relations. We have paid tribute to the countries that provided humanitarian assistance to those affected by the war in southern Sudan, including the United States. However, we are perplexed by the provocative statement recently made by the spokesman of the American Administration when he announced the donation of $25,000 to the victims of floods in the Sudan. The statement claimed that despite its differences with the Government of the Sudan, the American Administration is concerned about the welfare of the Sudanese people. 32 The American Administration launched 17 cruise missiles to destroy the pharmaceutical factory. Each of those missiles costs $1 million, for a total of $17 million to destroy our factory. Now the United States announces its contribution of $25,000 to the Sudanese victims of the floods, while the damage caused by the floods is estimated to exceed $40 million. Had the American Administration genuinely been concerned with the welfare and well-being of the Sudanese people, it would not have attacked and destroyed one of our main economic entities, which produced over 50 per cent of the essential and life-saving medicines which the Sudan requires. Therefore, on behalf of the Sudanese people, we say to the American Administration, that we want our factory back, the factory we built with our toil and sweat and which cost us millions of dollars. We need the medicine of which our people were deprived as a result of the destruction of the factory, particularly in this time of the flooding crisis which caused rampant diseases and epidemics, according to United Nations reports. Allow me now to briefly reflect on some of the conflicts that are taking place in our area, in view of their direct impact on peace and security in the region. I start with our eastern borders, where the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea will undoubtedly lead to a deterioration of the situation in the region. The Sudan, which still hosts hundreds of thousands of refugees from the two neighbouring countries, is strongly affected by this conflict. Hence, from this rostrum we urge the two neighbouring countries to exercise self-restraint and to resort to peaceful means to settle their differences. We also hope that the efforts of the OAU will succeed in reaching a peaceful settlement to this dispute. On the other hand, we are following with great concern the developments in our southern neighbour, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is suffering from external interference in its internal affairs. We hope that the efforts of the African countries will be successful in assisting the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in maintaining peace and stability on its territory. As regards the peace process in the Middle East, hopes for a final settlement have evaporated as a result of the Israeli intransigence, which placed hurdles on the road to peace. The Sudan welcomes the General Assembly resolution upgrading the Palestinian participation and supports the steps taken by the Palestinian leadership to declare the state of Palestine with Jerusalem as its capital. The Sudan also denounces the Israeli attempts to Judaize Jerusalem and change its demographic composition and legal status. Furthermore, the Sudan supports the rights of Syria and Lebanon to regain their occupied territories in the Golan and in southern Lebanon, and it calls upon the international community and the Security Council to exert pressure on Israel to implement the relevant Security Council resolutions and to heed the call for a just peace in order for the region to enjoy peace and security. The embargo imposed on Iraq has lasted for too long, and the suffering of the Iraqi people has deepened. Thousands of women, children and elderly people have lost their lives because of the lack of food and medicine, and the world is wondering when the blockade will come to an end. The latest impasse between the United Nations Special Commission and Iraq could result in catastrophic consequences in the area. This should prompt the Security Council to intervene by carrying out a comprehensive review of Iraqi compliance with Security Council resolutions with a view to lifting the embargo. The Sudan commends the efforts of the Secretary-General and expresses the hope that these efforts will lead to a breakthrough in the current impasse. The Sudan also wishes to stress the importance of resolving the issue of the detainees and the missing Kuwaitis as a humanitarian question, and it calls for redoubling regional and international efforts to settle this problem so that the women and children who have waited so long can be reunited with their husbands and parents. This would also eliminate the causes of tension and restore solidarity and reconciliation between Arab nations and States. As regards the issue of Lockerbie, we are very much concerned with the embargo imposed on the sisterly Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, our neighbour. The damaging consequences of this embargo have spilled over from Libya to the neighbouring countries, including the Sudan, which has hundreds of thousands of citizens living in the Jamahiriya. It is a cause for sadness that scores of those citizens have lost their lives while trying to cross the vast desert between the two countries as a result of the air blockade imposed on the Jamahiriya. While welcoming the recent positive developments in this issue, we stress the need to provide the guarantees requested by the Jamahiriya, as referred to by the President of Burkina Faso, the current Chairman of the OAU, in his statement before the Security Council last week. 33 Conflicts in Africa have caused numerous difficulties, including the problems of refugees and displaced persons. As a result, Africa has become host to the largest number of refugees in the world. Their number is estimated at more than 8 million, and they live in the harshest conditions. In its efforts to put an end to the suffering of refugees and to find durable solutions to this problem, the OAU decided to convene the first ministerial meeting of the Committee on Refugees and Disappeared Persons in Khartoum in December 1998 at the level of foreign minister. We in the Sudan look forward to the international community?s effective participation in and support for this conference in order to ensure its success. The countries of the continent are hopeful that the conference will produce results which would assist in dealing with this long-standing problem. I should like to conclude with a verse from the Holy Koran: “God commands justice, the doing of good, and liberality to kith and kin. He forbids all shameful deeds, and injustice and rebellion. He instructs you that ye may receive admonition.” (The Holy Koran, XVI:90)Allow me first to congratulate the President and wish him every success in carrying out his responsible task. The delegation of Poland will do its best to assist him in his important functions. I also pay tribute to the outgoing President, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, an eminent statesman from Ukraine, a country with which we have developed good- neighbourly ties of friendship and cooperation, for his excellent guidance of the work of the Assembly during its fifty-second session. I would also like to assure the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, not only of our respect and admiration, but also of our continued support for his tireless efforts to make the United Nations live up to the expectations of the twenty-first century and to the ideals set out in the Charter. We have a saying in Poland that is variously attributed to the Chinese or to the Jews — two nations well steeped in suffering and in wisdom: “Unfortunate one, you shall live to see your dreams satisfied.” And I, indeed, have come to experience the full measure of that truth. Ten years ago a dissident, I could barely even dream that I would be at the helm of my free nation?s foreign affairs, and in that role preside over the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), an organization which spans three continents in its attempt to promote security and cooperation in a conflict-torn world. And yet those 10 years ago, had I imagined that such a future were possible I would probably have believed that a man in my position could indeed help change the world, make it a better, safer place. Like so many of us present here in this Hall, I had to learn the bitter lessons of the limitations of power. These lessons should indeed teach us humility, but not serve as an alibi for not assuming our obligations. The world today is a better and safer place than it was 10 years ago, before the fall of the Berlin Wall. For all the needless suffering, the agony of hunger, the scourge of ethnic hatred and war, the shame of underdevelopment, the evil of oppression that human beings had to endure in so many places on the face of the planet — these are less than a decade ago. And even now the perpetrators attempt to conceal their doings, to show it is not so, and more, that suffering is contentment, war is peace, and oppression is liberty. Hypocrisy, as we all know, is a compliment sin pays to virtue. The world is a better place because time and time again evil has been avoided, circumscribed or reduced thanks to preventive action taken by concerned States. This action could be something as simple as sending food 20 where there is none, or as complicated as over a dozen nations pooling their military resources to prevent a new outbreak of ethnic hatred in Bosnia, and helping to rebuild that devastated nation. The world will never be the same. The world economy is currently confronted with the biggest financial challenge in a half century. We note the increasing interest on the part of politicians as well as economists in market intervention and capital controls. Obviously, a serious situation may indeed call for desperate remedies, but the really serious risk to the world economy seems to lie in a retreat from free market ideals and principles. Actions to limit the spread of weapons of mass destruction are an evident reflection of efforts made to consolidate peace and international security. Systematic progress in the field of nuclear disarmament, apart from important American-Russian and American-Chinese agreements, could become even more notable if the Parliament of the Russian Federation, heeding the appeals by the international community, ratified the START II agreements. We expect and hope that the indispensable decision will be taken in Moscow with no further delay. We welcome the decision of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament to enter negotiations on a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices. This is a significant and indispensable step for the further consolidation of the global regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. At the same time, we witness with concern and regret the developments in South Asia that are so dangerous to peace and international security. Although we do not question the right of any nation to sovereign decisions on issues concerning its national security interests, nothing, in our opinion, justifies acceptance of the nuclear option. The choice of the road of nuclear armaments by India and Pakistan comes as a blow to the ideals personified by Mahatma Gandhi. Together with the entire international community, we address to the leaders of India and Pakistan an appeal to refrain from any actions that could make the situation worse in the Indian subcontinent and to join, immediately and unconditionally, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The sixteenth-century Polish humanist Jakub Przyluski wrote: “Since man is ... more inclined to live in society than bees, ants or cranes, an isolated life is a thing most contrary to human nature. Man could then neither suffice to himself, nor come to the rescue of others... And since nature has established some kind of affinity between us, and the same definition encompasses all humankind, we are to consider it vile if man threatens man.” We, indeed, consider it vile if man threatens man. But it is in our nature, or at least in our better nature, to come to the rescue of others, the more so if by making others more secure, our own security is enhanced. Furthermore, neighbours usually know best the nature of the problems affecting the neighbourhood; they are therefore best placed to try to resolve them. That is why the concept of collective security is becoming so increasingly important and popular. But we must all learn this if this Organization is to successfully negotiate the transition into the twenty-first century. The United Nations has grown beyond the hopes and expectations — indeed, beyond control. Many of its specialized agencies accomplish their important jobs quietly and efficiently. We have perfect relations with many of them, especially with the United Nations Development Programme office in Warsaw. The Secretary-General is to be praised for his efforts to make the United Nations a better example of how the world?s institutions could function, rather than a cartoon of the way they actually do. But he can do this only with our support. Also, we can no longer delay the reform of the Security Council and the General Assembly. I am sure all of us look towards these changes with some dread, because knowing how wrong things could have turned out, we cannot believe that they have been going right until now. The United Nations is ripe for change. One of the most pressing issues on the United Nations reform agenda is the financial crisis. It is true this crisis is due in great part to the mismanagement of resources and, at times, excessive spending. But at least as much can be attributed to the deficit brought about by some Members? refusal to pay their dues on time. True, it is in large part because that pressure that a favourable climate for change emerged within the institution itself. It has become a truism to say that peacekeeping is ineffective when there is no peace to keep, and that peacemaking is impossible if there is no will to sustain the unavoidable costs. But this does not mean that 21 peacekeeping is ineffective. A wide spectrum of examples, from Cyprus to Moldova, shows that the contrary is true. But even in a successful peacekeeping operation we run the risk that we will not only keep the peace but also preserve the hatreds, envies and jealousies which were the root causes of the conflict in the first place. In this sense, each peacekeeping operation must also be one of peacemaking. Armed conflicts between States are giving way to internal conflicts, as in Rwanda and in the former Yugoslavia. Consequently, the United Nations peacekeeping forces are being faced, in many cases, with the dilemma of having to depart from the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of the State that is being torn apart by a civil war. We remain convinced that when a direct threat is posed to peace and security, the United Nations must be properly equipped to discharge its role and should not remain indifferent and ignore human suffering. Poland is proud of its continuous participation in United Nations peacekeeping efforts, following our old tradition of struggle “for freedom, ours and yours”. We are currently providing the largest contingent of troops involved in United Nations peacekeeping operations. We are convinced that the Organization should not allow the highest price to be paid in terms of the lives of women and men serving in the field under the United Nations banner. The security of people in United Nations peacekeeping and humanitarian operations must be ensured. My country finds itself at the centre of European transformation. Our aspirations to join European and trans- Atlantic political and military structures are in the process of being satisfied, fulfilling the dreams of a nation long subject to the cataclysms of European history. But far from turning our back on our neighbours who as yet remain outside these structures, we indeed wish to intensify our cooperation with them. We believe this would be conducive to a better climate on the continent, and in the best interests of both our neighbours and our allies. This is especially true of our cooperation with other Central European nations. Poland, solidly anchored in collective security and regional cooperation structures, can develop in peace and security and substantially contribute to the development of others. If there ever was a win-win scenario, this is it. It would be arrogant and unhelpful if we believed we could give lessons to others. But we do believe deeply that our experience of the last decade shows that nations can move away from authoritarianism, through negotiations — what we called round-table negotiations — to then successfully build a democratic system based on the rule of law, individual freedoms, freedom of economic enterprise and political democracy. To those, near or far, who proclaim that theirs will be a different course, based on the presumed specificity of their culture, history, customs and circumstance, we say, “Please reconsider. Do not waste the creative energy of your nations in futile experiments and grotesque performances.” This will not work. And time is a resource none can afford to waste. But at the same time, to those who would say, “Follow us, for history has proved that we are right”, — we would like to say that even among friends we can differ. We do not believe too much in the efficacy of punishment and sanction. Rather, we expect that nations need to develop apace. We can but help them on their way. This is best seen in the functioning of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which my country has the honour of chairing this year. It would be hard to imagine a collection of nations more geographically, historically, economically, culturally and politically diverse. Assuming the chairmanship of this organization for 1998, we have faced important questions and challenges. Can the organization that is the heritage of the past successfully cope with the challenges of the future? Is it needed during a period of both globalization and regionalization, a period of multi- polarity, when we are striving for the universalization of the Earth?s civilization? Will it be able to prevent conflicts and regulate inter-State relations? The Polish chairmanship started at the moment of significant changes in the so-called European security environment: when the Atlantic Alliance decided on its enlargement; when a conflict erupted in Kosovo, threatening South-Eastern Europe with destabilization; when the countries of Central Asia, born from the territory of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, signalled their more intensive interest in joining the current of values that are the foundation of the OSCE; and when signs of another crisis appeared in Russia. There arose the question of how to include OSCE activity in United Nations efforts for peace and security. We have found constructive and positive answers to many of those questions. The organization of an all- inclusive membership of the States of the region, from Vancouver to Vladivostok, turned out to be necessary to respond to threats left by the cold war. Two priorities 22 came to the fore: to prevent conflicts by reaching the roots at their early stage of appearance and to strengthen human rights and democracy, which the OSCE calls the “human dimension”. We have also taken up the ambitious challenge of preparing a European security charter, which would help to facilitate the functioning of cooperation in security within the OSCE, and would make it possible for all States, regardless of their membership in alliances or other groupings, to participate in the common effort of building a safe, democratic and united Europe. We want the OSCE community to have neither centre nor peripheries, neither more equal nor less equal. In many cases, as in the conflicts in Kosovo or Tajikistan, the lesson was bitter. One of the conclusions is that in the contemporary world, no organization can act alone. The consolidation of standards of civilizational cooperation within the OSCE must be coherent with the activity of other organizations, in this case the United Nations, the European Union, the North Atlantic Alliance, the Council of Europe and subregional organizations such as the Council of the Baltic States. We need this solidarity. There I wish to comment on the resolution adopted by the Security Council yesterday concerning Kosovo. It was an example of unity and solidarity, and I hope it will send a message to stop the bloodshed in that region and stop the activities of all those who are trying to introduce violence, repression and terrorism there. The OSCE has been able to engage in preventive diplomacy. We have done so together; we have strengthened our collective security together; we have fielded a host of projects in almost every imaginable sphere of human collective activity. In all fairness, one has to take into consideration the conflicts avoided elsewhere in the Balkans, as well as in Central Asia and in the Caucasus. We do not proclaim to be a model for others. The organization itself developed almost by chance, as a fortuitous assembly of the members of the two cold-war blocs. But we have been able to manage the transition and to set standards that we all try to maintain. Maybe other regions of conflicting interests could use some of our experience, both the successes and the mistakes. In the Middle East, we are facing a challenging and difficult time. Poland is committed to a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in that region. Therefore, we are deeply concerned by the stalemate in the peace process, and we strongly support all efforts to revitalize it, on the basis of Security Council resolutions, the principles of the Madrid Conference and the Oslo accords. In many aspects the world is now a safer and better place to live in than it was a decade ago. But there are new threats and dangers. We must deter and defeat terrorist acts. Poland continues to promote the idea of the elaboration of the comprehensive convention against organized crime, which should generate wide and efficient cooperation between States, since organized transnational crime cannot be successfully suppressed by any State alone. Borderlines are blurred. Ordinary crime blends with the organized underworld, which in turn intermingles with the terrorist community, and that in turn finds support and relief in more than one of the world?s capitals. Drugs and guns are replacing more conventional currencies as the universal currency of evil, profits from one serving to promote the dissemination of the other, in a concerted assault on human life itself. It is indeed a culture of death which seems to unite those who put guns and drugs into the hands of the young and teach them to hate others because they are of the wrong faith, race or nation. We cannot counter that evil with the same decisiveness, haste and cunning. We can, however, continue to support the alternative: a culture of life, founded on respect for the individual, his inalienable rights, dignity and freedom. In terms of everyday reality, this means that the determined effort of all States is required to implement the basic conventions guaranteeing these values — to implement them at home and to refuse to tolerate their violations abroad. Of these conventions, perhaps none is more important than the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, whose fiftieth anniversary we have been solemnly celebrating. And yet, among States whose representatives have expressed their attachment to that document, not a few deny their citizens the basic rights the Declaration guarantees. Obviously, the powerful political interests which lie behind such behaviour will not bow to simple declarations, nor will the international democratic community use force to implement its values. It is our deep conviction that we should continuously adapt United Nations human rights machinery to present and future developments in this area. The biggest challenge we have been facing over recent years is the violation of human rights in the context of armed conflicts and tensions of a domestic or civil character. For years the international community has not been able to 23 cope with this problem, although in the meantime the United Nations has developed a significant peacekeeping capacity. It is only after the traumatic experience in the former Yugoslavia and in the Great Lakes region that the approach has changed. “No man is an island”; no State is an island. Connected, as the Polish writer whom I quoted said, by a common definition of our humanity, we cannot help but try to implement the noblest goal, incarnate in the name of this Organization: the Nations United, in our common humanity, our planet and our future.   Allow me first of all to offer my sincere congratulations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay, Mr. Didier Opertti, on his election to the post of President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session and to wish him every success in this important task. I am confident that his long experience and abilities will contribute to the successful outcome of the current session of the General Assembly. I should also like to express our appreciation to the previous President of the General Assembly, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his energetic and professional work. I would like to take this opportunity to draw the Assembly’s attention to the problems that are of greatest concern to the States of our region. The international community fully recognizes the danger of recent developments in Afghanistan, South Asia and the Republic of Tajikistan. There is an enormous potential for conflict in this subregion today. The threat that the Afghan conflict may explode and spread to neighbouring States remains a real one. Uzbekistan has repeatedly appealed to the international community from this rostrum for assistance in resolving the Afghan problem. This goal should be served, inter alia, by our initiative to impose an arms embargo on Afghanistan. The appeal to halt deliveries of weaponry and matériel to all parties to the conflict has been reflected in numerous Security Council resolutions and awaits the creation of an effective mechanism within the United Nations so that it can be implemented. The Six Plus Two group, with the participation of Afghanistan’s neighbouring countries, as well as the United States and the Russian Federation, which was established as a result of a proposal by Uzbekistan, is today, in our opinion, the only effective international mechanism within the United Nations capable of launching the peace process. Its task is not to condemn the warring factions, to criticize them or to support one of them against the others. We are united by a common goal, which is to find a path to stability, security and peace. A great deal of interest is now focused on energy projects and transport communications in the region. However, the implementation of these projects should not cause confrontation, but should on the contrary promote stability and the development of mutually beneficial cooperation between the States of the region. Given the ongoing hostilities in Afghanistan, the importance of the Six Plus Two group as a full-fledged negotiating instrument is growing. Within that framework — and with the cooperation of the inter-Afghan forces — it is possible not merely to elaborate the terms of reconciliation but also the necessary measures to restore statehood to that country and bring about its economic revival. In that connection, we fully support the decisions of the meeting of the Six Plus Two group held at the level of Ministers for Foreign Affairs, which took place on 21 September of this year in New York. We also commend the efforts of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan, Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi. Recent developments in Afghanistan have confirmed that one of the most important conditions for the restoration of peace in the Islamic State of Afghanistan is the achievement of consensus at the regional level and the elaboration, under the aegis of the United Nations, of a 17 single position to be taken by the countries that have an influence on events in that country. Cooperation with the Afghan factions in order to reach a speedy settlement of the Afghan conflict is the ultimate goal of the proposed on-site meeting of the Six Plus Two group in Tashkent. We hope for further support for this proposal from interested States and the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan. The problems that affect the vital interests of Uzbekistan, in particular the establishment of lasting peace in Tajikistan, the cessation of war in Afghanistan, the imposition of an arms embargo on the Afghan zone of conflict, the establishment of a Central Asian nuclear- weapon-free zone, the construction of transport communications and the revival of Aral Sea are all part of global international processes that are under way and could be implemented under the aegis of the United Nations. I believe that the events of the last decade have convinced everyone that no State can, on its own, resolve transnational security problems such as illicit drug- trafficking, terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and of their components. The Government of Uzbekistan welcomes the efforts of the United Nations to counter the spread of narcotic drugs and to implement the Political Declaration adopted at the twentieth special session of the General Assembly, held in New York in June 1998. Today, in some European countries, up to 90 per cent of the narcotic drugs consumed originate in Afghanistan. The international community is aware of the need to take coordinated action to counter illegal trafficking in narcotic substances and to implement the principles of international cooperation in this area on the basis of mutual assistance and solidarity. However, we believe that these principles should also reflect specific regional aspects. In particular, once again we call for the elaboration of special programmes to plan for concrete, joint action by the States of Central Asia and the European Union. Unfortunately, terrorist acts have become a common occurrence in many countries. Existing international mechanisms to fight terrorism, including political isolation, economic sanctions and direct military intervention, are not achieving results. We should have no illusions about this phenomenon. Today we need coordinated and targeted action by the entire international community. In that connection, we welcome discussion of one of the most complex issues in international law: the possibility of and need for a new approach to the problem of terrorism. The importance of resolving this whole set of problems is obvious. In this connection, Uzbekistan has taken the initiative to establish within the framework of the United Nations a commission for the prevention of terrorist activities and for fighting international terrorism. The main task of such a commission would be to formulate recommendations on questions relating to the fight against international terrorism. Making use of legal norms, the United Nations could prosecute the organizers and perpetrators of terrorist acts. If Member States support this initiative, Uzbekistan will take an active part in bringing it to fruition. Uzbekistan has consistently taken steps to ensure peace and strengthen regional security. One of these is Uzbekistan’s initiative to establish a Central Asian nuclear-weapon-free zone. Considerable progress has already been made to implement this idea. Allow me to cite the closing statement of the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko: “In a decision designed to further promote the regime of nuclear nonproliferation, the Assembly adopted a consensus resolution supporting the initiative to establish one more nuclear-weapon-free zone, in Central Asia. The significance of that step became even more apparent in the light of the recent nuclear tests in southern Asia”. (A/52/PV.92) Here, let me express our special gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and to the Under- Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs, Mr. Jayantha Dhanapala, for their well-informed and strong support of this initiative. When considering potential threats to national security, we ought today to give special attention to problems of ecological security and environmental protection. It is common knowledge that the drying up of the Aral Sea has caused many complex ecological, socio- economic and demographic problems, whose origins and gravity are international, even global. The Aral crisis is one of the most serious of the world’s ecological and humanitarian disasters. It has had a direct impact on more than 35 million people who live in the Aral Sea basin. A number of decisions have been adopted at international and regional meetings on the problem of the Aral Sea. But these have not been backed up by practical 18 action. We are obliged to say that the idea is gaining ground in the international community that the Aral crisis can be contained through humanitarian operations. That is not the case. This is an extraordinary ecological problem that requires the establishment within the United Nations system of a regional commission on the ecology of Aral Sea. This initiative is justified by the need to formulate and implement a specific long-term strategy and programme for resolving the Aral crisis on the basis of the principles of sustainable development, maintaining the standard of living of the people of the region, and ensuring a decent life for future generations. Modern Uzbekistan is in the process of establishing a State based on the rule of law, a civil society and an effective, socially oriented market economy. It has an acute need for the experience and know-how of international bodies. At the same time, our republic is devoting great attention to the question of recruiting Uzbek experts for the activities of a variety of United Nations bodies. Let me stress that the level of training and knowledge of Uzbek specialists is fully in keeping with the requirements for recruitment to the bodies and specialized agencies of the United Nations system. I am confident that specialists from Uzbekistan can and should contribute to the work of international organizations. In conclusion, I should like to stress in particular that our relationship with the United Nations is intended not only to obtain assistance and support, but primarily to enable us to play our full part in the successful implementation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations and to give fresh content to the activities of the Organization.  First of all, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty- third session, convinced as I am that under your leadership and with your vast experience and profound knowledge of international affairs the work of the session will be successful. I would also like to take this opportunity to salute your friendly country of Uruguay. I would also like to express thanks to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for his successful conduct of the work of our previous session. I would like to extend, as well, our deep thanks to Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of our Organization, for the earnest determination and great competence he has brought to bear on the matters entrusted to him. This fifty-third session of the General Assembly is being held as we bid farewell to the current century and prepare to usher in a new millennium. A large portion of humanity is still facing international conditions that do not come close to enabling them to achieve their ambition and their hope to live in a world where peace, international justice, economic development and life in dignity prevail. Despite some signs of economic development in certain third world countries, the general trend points to an increasing gap between the advanced world and the developing world. The developing world is facing major changes over which it has no control, including a heavy debt burden, dwindling prices for raw materials, difficulty in gaining access to markets, financial speculation and low foreign investments. This situation demands that our Organization not merely confine itself to preserving international peace and security in the classical sense, but go beyond that and seek to reduce the economic and social burden of developing countries. This would contribute to the emergence of a new world order based on consensus, consultation and partnership among all countries. Since its independence, Morocco has firmly believed in the need to base its economic policy on the principle of free enterprise and external openness as a means of achieving the country?s economic progress and social development. Thus Morocco made an effective contribution to the multilateral trade negotiations that resulted in the founding of the World Trade Organization in Marrakech. Morocco will also participate, with the same degree of resolution, in the forthcoming negotiations with other Member States to ensure that the international community achieves equitable distribution of the dividends of the international trade system, without overlooking the need for proper coordination of monetary, financial and trade policies, lest the financial crisis currently affecting certain international markets have adverse effects on the economies of other countries. One of the world?s primary political trouble spots, indeed one of the most complex problems threatening world peace and security, is the problem of the Middle East. The many resolutions of the United Nations aimed at finding a solution to this problem have failed to enable the Palestinian people to enjoy their inalienable and legitimate rights or to compel Israel to withdraw from the Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem — Al-Quds — and the other occupied territories in the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon. Those resolutions met only with Israeli rejection and defiance. In this respect, the reneging by the current Israeli Government on the implementation of the agreements signed as part of the peace process following the Madrid conference and the Oslo meetings dashed the hopes that had been pinned on those agreements and again plunged the region into a spiral of despair and instability. Israel?s reneging is quite obvious in its current procrastination tactics as well as its attempts to impose a policy of fait accompli through the building of further settlements in the occupied territories, in violation of all international norms and laws. Recently, Israel further compounded the situation by implementing, in a provocative way, a policy for the Judaization of Jerusalem — Al-Quds — by changing its cultural and demographic characteristics and surrounding it with settlement colonies. The latest such measure was the announcement by the Israeli Government last June of the expansion of the municipal boundaries of Al-Quds, as part of what is known as “Greater Jerusalem”. 32 The entire Islamic world, as it denounces and condemns these practices, which affect the status of Al-Quds as an integral part of the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967, considers all these Israeli practices as null and void. This was indeed confirmed by the meeting of the Al-Quds Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, under the chairmanship of His Majesty King Hassan II, in Casablanca at the end of July. Morocco believes that this problem can be solved only through respect for the letter and spirit of the agreements signed and through the implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy, especially the relevant Security Council resolutions, in a way that will guarantee the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the establishment of their independent state, with Al-Quds as its capital, and the return of the occupied Arab territories to their legitimate owners. Despite the tremendous potential and enormous resources available in Africa, and despite the fact that most African countries carry out appropriate economic policies, the African continent is still suffering from serious political, economic and social crises which have led to the marginalization of our continent and the shrinkage of its role in the international arena. Some of these crises are clearly reflected in worsening unemployment, increased debt burden, falling prices for commodities exported by African countries, inadequate foreign investment and declining foreign assistance, which stands at barely 0.22 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries, despite the fact that the amount agreed upon is 0.7 per cent. It is indeed regrettable that the deterioration of the economic situation has contributed to a resurgence of political instability and military confrontations in certain African regions, as is the case at present in the Great Lakes region, the Horn of Africa and Western Africa. While expressing concern about this situation, Morocco supports efforts aimed at containing these crises and at guaranteeing the countries of those regions, especially the Democratic Republic of the Congo, their territorial integrity, stability and security. In this respect, Morocco commends the efforts made by the States members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to find a solution to the crises in Liberia and Sierra Leone. We hope that the efforts being made to overcome the crisis in Guinea-Bissau will soon be successful. In order to find a solution to African economic problems and their political repercussions, we would like to reaffirm the proposal made by His Majesty King Hassan II during the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting in Marrakesh for adopting an international plan similar to the Marshall Plan, with a view to ensuring African economic revival. We would like to thank the Secretary-General of our Organization for the important report he prepared on Africa at the request of the Security Council. We hope that the international community will seek to give concrete substance to its recommendations through the settlement of conflicts and the strengthening of security and stability in our continent so as to contribute to the necessary conditions for its economic and social development. Morocco has consistently affirmed that its membership in the Arab Maghreb Union is a free and strategic option which is irreversible, dictated by its historic and civilizational roots, as well as by its current and future interests. Given the existence of this membership, Morocco cannot but express its deep concern over the continuing suffering of the brotherly Libyan people as a result of the air embargo imposed on them, which caused them a great deal of hardship. We welcome the approval by the United States and the United Kingdom of the Libyan proposal, which was supported by the League of Arab States, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement, to try the two Libyan suspects in a neutral country. On the other hand, we deeply regret the suffering of another Arab people — the Iraqi people — as a result of the pernicious effects of the economic embargo imposed on that country. We hope that the agreement reached between the Iraqi Government and the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, will lead to a resumption of cooperation between Iraq and the United Nations so that the embargo can be lifted and the hardships of this brotherly people can be ended. We also hope that the Secretary-General will succeed in finding a definitive solution to this protracted crisis. As a Mediterranean State geographically located near European States, Morocco has been taking a special interest, as always, in efforts to consolidate Euro- Mediterranean cooperation. However, Morocco cannot but be concerned about the continuing status of the Moroccan 33 cities of Ceuta and Melilla and the neighbouring islands, which are still under Spanish occupation, at a time when the page of colonialism in most parts of the world has been turned. His Majesty King Hassan II proposed some time ago the setting up of a Moroccan-Spanish panel to consider and find a solution to this abnormal situation, in a way that would guarantee Morocco?s sovereignty over its territory while taking into account the economic interests of Spain. Although the Spanish authorities have not yet reacted to this fair proposal, Morocco remains convinced that the depth of its historical and economic ties with neighbouring Spain, coupled with the aspirations of the two peoples to achieve greater rapprochement, cooperation and participation in many fields, will be sufficient to enable the two countries to reach a formula for a definitive solution to this problem. With regard to developments in the referendum process in our southern provinces — the area known as Western Sahara — we can only point out that it is still experiencing some difficulties. The identification process was stalled from the outset because the other party, without justification, refused to take part in the identification of a large number of candidates. Yet these candidates fulfilled the agreed criteria and had been registered by the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara. Once again we are now faced with the refusal of the other party to participate in the identification of these candidates, who this time presented themselves in accordance with the Houston agreements that the other party had, indeed, also accepted. Those agreements confirmed the right of candidates to be identified and reasserted the validity of oral testimony. Indeed, in accordance with those agreements, the two parties had agreed to begin, as soon as possible, the identification of any individual who may present himself or herself for that purpose. We can only express deep concern over these developments, which will delay the referendum operation which has been long awaited by Morocco and the Saharan refugee brothers who have been yearning for more than 20 years to return to their homeland, Morocco, in order to participate in their region?s ongoing development. This will probably also have repercussions on the building of the greater Maghreb to which the peoples of the region aspire. The relentless determination to exclude a number of Saharans from participation in the referendum casts still more doubts on the will of the other party to ensure the necessary conditions for the organization of a fair and transparent referendum. We hope that the tremendous progress the world is currently witnessing will be a factor leading to the emergence of solidarity among all peoples, solidarity that will contribute to ensuring greater advancement towards development, security, peace and the spread of tranquillity and prosperity among all peoples of the world.   The election of the Foreign Minister of Uruguay as President of this session of the General Assembly is a source of great pride to Latin America. It is also a fitting tribute to Mr. Opertti, whose diplomatic experience and skills augur well for the success of this fifty-third session. Just when it seemed that we had secured stability, signs of a severe crisis reappeared in the horizon. Indeed, commodity prices have declined on average by 30 per cent, reaching their lowest levels in the last three decades in real terms. Consequently, exports from Latin America to developed countries, consisting primarily of raw materials, have begun to shrink, and trade balance deficits in the region have increased proportionately. There has been a decline in growth of output in Latin America. Businesses are reducing production volume, paying less tax and going further into debt with the banks. There is a proportionate decline in domestic savings and investment in infrastructure, in the training of human resources and in the production of goods and services. Visible unemployment is on the rise, and shadow economic activities are gaining ground. This brief account — no less grim for its brevity — of the current situation points to a dangerous recession in Asia and Latin America. Of course, the fact that this turbulence began about a year ago in Asia, halfway round the world, before reaching the Andes, reveals the extent to which the world economic system has become interdependent. Both the scale and the consequences of this interdependence would have been inconceivable until recently. The planet has indeed become the global village which was to be the sign of the future, as we had all heard. But there is an ugly and unfair side to globalization that I wish to stress. Countries — and when I use the word, I do not just mean abstract entities, but actual people with spiritual and material needs — are not paying only for their own mistakes but also for the economic policy errors and negligence of others. Let me take my own country as an example. A small country, with enormous structural limitations, it made a gigantic effort, at enormous cost and at the price of enormous sacrifices, to put its accounts and institutional structure in order. Bolivia overcame hyper-inflation, restored its macroeconomic balance and made progress in first- and second-generation structural reforms. We established a democratic system which, while not perfect, is being studied in our region as a model of political cooperation and social dialogue. We are prepared to commit all our energies to casting off the historic chains of corruption and poverty. This entire effort, just now beginning to be productive, may be thwarted by causes that are beyond our control and for which we bear no responsibility. It is true that our progress may not have been sufficiently rapid and that our economic and social structures are still weak, but the crisis we face today does not stem from these deficiencies. Bolivia and other countries will have to foot the bill for the mistakes of others, for far distant trivialities. We are suffering, the analysts tell us, from the contagion of the Asian crisis, and we would do well to pray harder to prevent anything happening in our own country or anywhere in the broad region surrounding us. My country did what it had to do and did it well. No one wants to go back to the past. No right-thinking Bolivian wants for a moment to return to the days of authoritarianism, hyper-inflation or the bureaucratic state. No, this is not what it is all about. But nor is it about acting as if nothing had happened — as if all that was necessary to overcome this crisis was to take a stronger dose of the same medicine. That would be an unforgivable mistake. The current situation has revealed such shortcomings in the international system, particularly with regard to international financial flows, that it would not make sense to keep things as they are. Next month there will be a meeting of the Ministers of Finance of the Group of Seven — the nexus of world economic power — to decide our fate. I do not know if our voice will be heard, 16 but I do believe that this Assembly of the peoples of the world is itself a message that can at least remind them of a few things. There is a need for prompt and concerted action on the part of the advanced and developing countries to diminish the volatility of financial markets and to provide some discipline and procedures for incentives and penalties aimed at remedying the major shortcomings in these markets. There must be an increase in the availability of public financial resources in the International Monetary Fund and other institutions to compensate promptly and efficiently for damage caused by unduly heightened risk in any given country or by the wanton recklessness of speculators on the world’s stock markets. There must be a discussion very soon about the nature and the new role of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and of the necessary adjustments thereto, because these bodies were created in a context quite different from that of today and clearly have been overwhelmed by the events of recent years, which could not be prevented. Their structure, their resources, their philosophy and their modus operandi were severely criticized since the 1980s in Latin America and in the Assembly, and today they have shown themselves to be unable to contain the impact of the current crisis. We have globalized the crises of poverty and unemployment. Let us also globalize the commitment to solve them. By virtue of the universal nature of this body, by virtue of the terms of the Charter of San Francisco and because it is here that the concerns and problems of the States Members of this supreme world Organization should be set forth, I must once again raise what is well known as Bolivia’s maritime problem. Almost 120 years ago, in a military confrontation not of its own making, Bolivia lost a long strip of coastline on the Pacific Ocean. Our country thus lost, temporarily, its maritime status, its sovereign access to the sea — an essential condition of its existence — as well as its geopolitical role and status as a bridge between the great basins of South America. The economic damage wrought by this loss was immense. I will not take time here today to mention the value of the minerals and fishing resources of this territory, as it is incalculable. Suffice it to recall that recent studies have shown that the cost of the landlocked condition of my country is estimated at $4 billion every 10 years, an amount equal to that of our foreign debt. However, perhaps the most serious consequence of this ill-fated event was that my country was condemned to be penned in behind the Andes, far removed from the mainstream of the passage of goods, peoples and cultures, which are the very lifelines of the development of nations. Therefore, ever mindful of the magnitude of the damage, my country never accepted this status of isolation imposed upon us. We have unceasingly called for this injustice to be redressed, but in doing so we have abided by our tradition as peaceful people that rejects conflicts. However, our voices never fell silent. We sought bilateral negotiations with Chile and brought our case to international forums. On various occasions, the bilateral negotiations concluded with agreements or concrete proposals for a solution whose main objective was the return to Bolivia of its sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean, with a coastline, a port of its own and an overland link. For reasons that I shall not go into now, these dealings were never concluded and were added to the long list of lost opportunities on the record of relations between our countries. Bolivia’s cause has always been met with the sympathy and understanding of the international community. There have been numerous expressions of such solidarity. I would just like to refer to two, one in the framework of the Non-Aligned Movement and the other in that of the Organization of American States (OAS). I will state only the relevant portion of the resolution adopted by the ninth General Assembly of the Organization of American States, which was held in La Paz in 1979. That resolution states, in its operative part that, “it is in the inherent interest of our hemisphere to find an equitable solution whereby Bolivia can obtain sovereign and effective access to the Pacific Ocean” as part of a proposal aimed at, “securing, in a spirit of fraternity and integration of the Americas, the objective referred to in the previous paragraph and to consolidate a stable peace which would stimulate economic and social progress in the region of the Americas directly affected by the consequences of Bolivia’s landlocked condition.” 17 In spite of everything, the problem still awaits a solution. It is a kind of throwback to another time, another logic, another way of seeing relations between neighbouring nations. This has left an indelible mark on the memory of my country. I must therefore state emphatically before the Assembly that Bolivia will never back down from its demand and that it will not be discouraged by how long its efforts may take. Bolivia has the staying power and limitless patience of an ancient people and knows that the time is sure to come when this long-standing issue will be definitively resolved. Our hope becomes conviction when we see how other nations find ways of unravelling the Gordian knot of conflicts at least as complex as our own. The case made by President Hugo Banzer last year in the Assembly is still valid. He recently put it again to the twelfth presidential summit of the Rio Group in the following terms: “There is no subject which cannot be discussed, if it is approached in good faith, without preconceptions or prejudices. The subjects of peace, security and democracy are not items reserved for diplomats and specialists. All the institutions of society have an opinion to voice and ideas to contribute. These are voices which must be heard and heeded. I would therefore like to propose that wherever there is open conflict between our nations or where the embers of ancient conflicts still smoulder, let us call upon our citizens to help us find the path to solutions. Let us throw open the windows of Latin American diplomacy and let in the fresh air of new opinions and the sound of new voices. Only recently I made the same point by suggesting that Bolivians and Chileans meet together and talk about the vast potential of our relationship and find a way of removing the obstacles which block its path. I am repeating this here today, because I am convinced that we must find a way of breaking with the status quo. We cannot bind ourselves to the inheritance of other times and other problems.” It could not be clearer that now is the time for economic integration and a political solution for access to the ocean, not for confrontations. The nature of the global system requires the formation of large-scale spaces in which ideas and goods can move freely, where common institutions can be built and where new cultures can be nurtured, the fruit of the mingling of diverse peoples. If this is true anywhere, it is true in Latin America. In order to clear the path along these major highways, we must remove the obstacles that are blocking or hindering the march towards integration. In the case of relations between Bolivia and Chile, this means resolving the age-old disputes which led to the breaking off of diplomatic relations at the end of the 1970s. The liberalization of trade, agreements on economic complementarity and arrangements for free transit are all essential parts of this picture, but not the whole picture. For this to happen, what is needed is vision and courage on both sides. If we want to find new, different solutions in keeping with the times, we can no longer remain mired in the juridical, diplomatic and military logic of the past. If we want to find answers, we may have to move outside those circles that have traditionally handled these matters up to now. This is the sense of the proposal of President Banzer: to bring businessmen, workers, churches, professionals and the peoples of Bolivia and Chile into the dialogue. Of course, the international community has a crucial role to play in the search for agreement. The counsel, guidance and help of friendly countries within the framework of the subregional integration processes in which they are engaged may just be the missing factor needed to get dialogue going, to bring diplomats to the negotiating table, to make leaders shoulder their historical responsibilities and to reach a solution bringing our peoples together. My country is convinced that the underlying problems must be dealt with because we know that integration will be consolidated only when economic agreements guarantee that it will be sustained by the political will and confidence of our nations. There are many initiatives that should not be left only on paper. Last June, during the special session devoted to the drug problem, important proposals were made. Bolivia put forth the idea of creating a body, similar to a consultative group, made up of countries that would help finance the high cost of the fight against drug- trafficking. We would like to know what steps have been taken to implement this, as well as the other initiatives that were proposed in that highly important specialized forum. The phenomenon of corruption, which is no stranger to most countries represented here, is a disease that spreads and damages our institutional structures, saps the legitimacy of democracy, distorts the economy, creates bad habits in public administration and erodes morality. 18 In compliance with a presidential order, last 21 September we had the honour of celebrating at a solemn ceremony the signing of an accord among the principal institutions of the State representing the three branches of power, whereby the National Integrity Plan came into effect. This Plan establishes a comprehensive strategy to combat corruption. The judicial basis for the Plan is taken from the Inter-American Convention against Corruption, which was signed by the member States of the OAS in 1996 and which Bolivia was the first nation to ratify as the law of the land. After careful thought, we have made this policy one of the highest priorities of the Government of Bolivia. We have begun to put into effect the first concrete measures to combat this evil and to make this proposal State policy. We now invite the international community to follow our endeavour closely and to support our initiative. Bolivia vigorously adheres to all the statements that have repudiated terrorism, a despicable practice that has no justification whatsoever. It will support any initiative or action that may be put forth to fight it. In another area, we wish to underline the Secretary- General’s task in the process of the reform of the United Nations. We believe that there has been progress in the efforts to reduce bureaucracy, rationalize expenses and avoid duplication in the work of the United Nations. We also believe that it would be healthy to enhance the Economic and Social Council in order to turn it into an economic, social, scientific and technological council. It would also be worthwhile to create a council for humanitarian affairs responsible for social problems of our time, such as poverty, unemployment, discrimination and all forms of exclusion. We meet every year to express our concerns and thoughts, to share experiences and reaffirm our faith in the purposes and principles of the San Francisco Charter. Each year, we would like to see positive advances in the solution of problems, in joint responses to crises, in the spread of peace on the world map. Thus, the United Nations will continue to grow even stronger. Bolivia wishes, as always, to contribute to the achievement of those goals.  Allow me first of all to congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. His election to that high office demonstrates not only the support that Uruguay enjoys in the international arena, but also the confidence and trust that the members of the Assembly have in his ability to guide the work of this session to a successful conclusion. Allow me also to record my delegation’s profound gratitude and appreciation to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, for the exemplary manner in which he steered the work of the General Assembly throughout the past year. I would also like to take this opportunity, on behalf of my delegation, to express our sincere thanks and admiration to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his untiring work and dedication in promoting the cause of this Organization. The Secretary- General deserves every assistance and cooperation from all the States Members of the Organization in his endeavours to fulfil the enormous responsibilities that we have placed upon his shoulders in achieving the goals of the United Nations in a world full of political unrest, ethnic conflicts and natural disasters. From the forest fires in South-East Asia, Europe and North America to the horrendous floods and droughts in Asia, Africa and the Americas, we have been witnessing a drastic increase in the number of natural disasters occurring in various regions of the world with immense loss to human life and property. The excessive effects of the environmental phenomena known as El Niño and La Niña are sweeping across four continents with deadly consequences. Record-breaking temperatures around the globe have spared no country. My country also experienced record high temperatures early this year, bleaching and killing coral reefs and causing enormous 6 imbalance in the ever so fragile ecosystem that surrounds our tiny islands. The Maldives may be situated outside the cyclone belt; we may have no rivers to flood, volcanoes to erupt or large forests to burn. But my country is as vulnerable to natural disasters as any other. Indeed, for the past decade we have lived with the fear of being slowly engulfed by the rising waters of the mighty Indian Ocean that surrounds us. Our fears have become more alarming since we have seen the death and destruction caused by the tsunami in Papua New Guinea and the devastating floods in Bangladesh. We have been forced to wonder what would happen if such a disaster struck our tiny, low-lying country. When my President addressed this Assembly on the impending dangers of global warming and sea level rise over a decade ago, the extent of the threat posed by climate change was not yet widely known or accepted. Today we note that the realities of global warming are being acknowledged by scientists and politicians all over the world. However, mere acknowledgement of the danger is not enough. As we have stated repeatedly over the years, if we are to arrest and reverse this lurking threat, we need the unwavering commitment and cooperation of the entire international community. It is important that we fully and urgently implement the commitments that we ourselves have undertaken at various international conferences. In this regard, I urge the international community, and especially the industrialized countries, to honour their commitments without any further delay. My delegation believes that full and unconditional implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States is essential for the continued development of those countries. My country, for its part, has done and will continue to do everything that is required of it to contribute to this goal, and we hope that the other Members of this Organization will fulfil their commitments. Although we were happy with some of the agreements reached at the Kyoto Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change last year, I regret to say that we were not fully satisfied with the achievements there. We accepted the Kyoto Protocol because we felt that it contained some important elements that deserved recognition and implementation, and because it is the best negotiated agreement available at present. In order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the climate change negotiations, we went one step further and signed the Kyoto Protocol as the first signatory State. We call upon all States to become parties to the Protocol and implement the targets specified in it. In our small island States, the environment and the economy are intertwined very closely. Tourism and fishing are the two dominant economic sectors in the Maldives, and in a number of other small island States as well. For the Maldives, the tourism sector has been the main source of foreign exchange earnings and has accounted for more than 40 per cent of gross domestic product. Effects of global warming such as sea level rise, beach erosion, coral bleaching, increasing stress on coastal ecosystems, salinization of freshwater aquifers and damage to infrastructure from tropical storms are, however, threatening to jeopardize the viability and the long-term sustainability of our tourist industry. Given the limited availability of resources, many small island developing States, including the Maldives, are not in a position to carry the burden of the high cost of environmental protection on their own. Therefore, we are fully convinced that without adequate, new and additional financial resources, transfer of environmentally sound technology on concessional and preferential terms, and provision for human resources development, even the mere survival of our countries will be impossible. The vulnerability to external factors of the economies of small island developing States, especially the least developed countries among them, is a well- known fact. Globalization, coupled with the ecological fragility of small island developing States, has marginalized those countries from the present multilateral trading system. Exports from least developed countries have grown far more slowly than world trade over the past two decades, resulting in a continued decline in their share of world trade. Market access for least developed countries is becoming narrower. Poverty still remains a stumbling-block in their quest for achieving sustainable social and economic development. Therefore, we would like to take this opportunity to call upon the major players in the world economy and upon our development partners to pay special attention to assisting small island States and other least developed countries in their efforts to become integrated into the world economy. When gross domestic product is used as an indicator to determine the developmental status of a country, the small island developing States may appear to be more prosperous than they really are. We believe that the criteria now used by the Committee for Development Policy in identifying least developed countries do not take 7 into consideration the special circumstances of the small island developing States and their vulnerability. The Committee has already recommended the graduation of four small island developing States from the list of least developed countries. The Maldives is, unfortunately, one of them. The irony of this is that the economies of these countries are heavily dependent on one or two industries, which may be extremely vulnerable to global economic and environmental changes and other external factors. Moreover, while the Committee itself has identified the obstacles to integration into the global economy and has called for continued official development assistance for least developed countries for at least another 10 years, some of the countries most in need of such assistance have been earmarked for graduation by the year 2000. My delegation feels that it would be grossly unfair to graduate countries from least developed country status unless they are able to sustain the momentum of growth that they have been able to achieve. Furthermore, the criteria which were adopted in 1991 need to be reviewed in the context of the increased pace of globalization during the 1990s. Until such time as a vulnerability index is developed, it would be very imprudent to graduate any small island States. This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a major milestone in the promotion and protection of human rights, providing an essential basis for democracy, freedom and justice. Human rights apply without regard to race, gender, creed, age, colour or economic status. But everywhere we look — north, south, east or west — the reality often falls short of the ideal. Therefore, we must redouble our efforts to promote and protect human rights the world over. The Maldives remains firmly committed to the cause of promotion and protection of human rights. I am happy to report that this year a new Constitution has come into force in the Maldives, providing stronger safeguards for civil liberties and the fundamental rights of the people, and strengthening the foundations and processes of our democracy. We have also been able to achieve remarkable progress in the realization of social, economic and cultural rights of the people through continued economic development and social progress. We believe that democracy, development and peace are essential for the realization of human rights. The question of reform of the Organization has been on the agenda of the General Assembly for quite some time. Although the process of reform has proved to be a difficult one, my delegation does not wish to see it prolonged, for we believe that its momentum cannot be maintained indefinitely. However, it is important that we remain focused on the central issue of making this Organization ready and capable of delivering the promise of peace, justice and prosperity for all human beings, irrespective of their colour, race, gender or belief, and the promise of providing the means to protect our environment and enjoy our fundamental freedoms. This means that reform should cover the United Nations system in its entirety. On the specific question of the reform of the Security Council, my delegation appreciates the efforts of the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters Related to the Security Council. However, we remain concerned about the lack of progress in its proceedings, and are worried about the prevailing difficulties which are preventing an early agreement on this important issue. We remain convinced of the importance of the early and successful conclusion of the efforts to make the Security Council more responsive to and representative of the current world realities in order to make it more effective. The commitment of the Maldives to arms control, disarmament and international peace and security remains unwavering. We are parties to all major multilateral instruments relating to arms control and disarmament. Since its inception, we have been faithfully and regularly contributing to the international Register of Conventional Arms. We signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) last year and are presently going through the process of ratifying it. This morning we have signed the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. My delegation is happy to note the considerable progress the international community has made in the field of arms control and disarmament, and commends the bilateral initiatives that have been proved to be so successful. We believe that both bilateral and multilateral approaches must reinforce and complement each other if we are to successfully achieve complete disarmament. In my delegation’s view, the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace in various regions of the world is a positive step towards achieving nuclear disarmament. At this juncture, we particularly stress the importance of the establishment of the proposed 8 nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia, and take this opportunity to call upon all countries in South Asia to exercise maximum restraint and contribute to the realization of this noble objective. In our quest to make the world a safer place we must not think only of the big Powers and the big bangs. Security is indivisible, whether in terms of geography or range of threat. The continuing scourge of terrorism, which rears its ugly and murderous head all too frequently, is as much the bane of international security today as is the spread of nuclear and other dangerous weapons. That terrorist groups may gain access to such weapons is an alarming thought. For small States the threats posed by terrorists are allied with and magnified by the activities of drug-traffickers, money-launderers and other manifestations of organized crime. That is why we have acceded to many international conventions against terrorism and are actively considering acceding to the remaining conventions. I would also like to take this opportunity to repeat the appeal made by my President at the historic fiftieth anniversary commemorative session of this body for the signature and early ratification of the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries in order to expedite its entry in to force. My delegation believes that in the face of these threats it is in the interest of the international community to provide adequate safeguards for small States, which are in reality the front-line States against most of these evil deeds. We are happy to see the establishment of the International Criminal Court. Those who perpetrate war crimes, genocide and other crimes against humanity must not be allowed to cross a border to safety or anonymity. This is why an international court that can systematically prosecute major war criminals wherever they are has to be established. This need has become more urgent in this post- cold-war period, which is characterized by the proliferation of conflicts of unprecedented ferocity. The horrifying crimes against humanity committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and elsewhere cannot be allowed to recur at any time or at any place. The perpetrators of those crimes should be brought to justice. My delegation strongly believes that the ultimate legal guarantee of peace and justice in the world lies in the strength and resolve of the international community and not in the strength and resolve of a single country. In conclusion, I once again would like to stress the vulnerability of small island developing States. My delegation believes that urgent and immediate action is absolutely necessary to alleviate the difficulties faced by these countries due to environmental degradation. If the present-day predictions for climate change were to come true, the Maldives and many other small island countries would have to face the frightful reality of extinction. Time is running out. Let us do something immediately. Otherwise, we will be no more.  I bring greetings, Sir, from the Government and the people of Nigeria, on whose behalf I am honoured and privileged to address this fifty-third session of the General Assembly, which is taking place under your presidency. Your election to the presidency is an expression of the confidence which Member States repose in you and a measure of our faith in your capacity to bring to bear on the work of the Assembly your wisdom, competence and diplomatic skills. I congratulate you most warmly on your election and also wish you a very successful tenure. My delegation would also like to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for the excellent manner in which he conducted the affairs of the fifty-second session. We also take this opportunity to express our immense satisfaction with the way Secretary-General Kofi Annan has steered the affairs of our Organization. We wish to assure him of our fullest support and cooperation as he leads our Organization into the twenty-first century. The United Nations represents the will of all mankind to collectively seek solutions to the common problems facing our world. It demonstrates the ingenuity of the human spirit to assemble the diverse peoples of the world in a collaborative effort to attain the goals of international peace and security, promotion of socio- economic development, respect for human rights, good governance and rule of law. Our active participation in the affairs of this Organization since independence in 1960 is indicative of our belief in its continued relevance as a unique institution where all nations — big and small, rich and poor, developed and developing — meet on the basis of equality and mutual respect to harmonize their interests and policies for the common good. It is for this reason that we have continued to demonstrate our commitment to work in collaboration with Member States for the strengthening and revitalization of the United Nations and its agencies. We therefore believe strongly that the issue of reform and democratization of the United Nations must be brought to the front burner. Reform is a continuing process and is consistent with the rapid changes taking place in our world. Our Organization will become irrelevant if it fails to adapt its structures and management style to present- day realities. In this regard, my delegation wishes to commend Mr. Kofi Annan, our Secretary-General, for his dedication and steadfast commitment to the cause of reform, and the generally positive attitude of Member States to the critical issues of reform and democratization of the United Nations. However, we must admit that substantive progress has been very slow because of the narrow positions which some delegations and regional groupings have continued to take on the fundamental issues of reform and democratization of the United Nations. We therefore urge all Member States to demonstrate urgent political will in this task of renewing the Organization for the next millennium by working out mutually acceptable compromises that will move the reform process forward. In doing this, we shall be able to build an Organization with the capacity and the potential to make our world safer and more prosperous. 7 With regard to the particular issue of the reform and democratization of the Security Council — a subject to which my country, being one of the original sponsors of the relevant resolution, attaches great importance — I am disheartened to note that no tangible substantive progress has been made five years after the creation of the Open- ended Working Group on the subject. We note here again that mistrust and suspicion among States thwarted any visible movement towards a successful outcome. Yet the status quo is not in the best interest of the general membership of the United Nations. Surely, the Council needs to be restructured, its membership expanded in both the permanent and non-permanent categories and its working methods, decision-making methods and decision- making processes improved. This is the path towards the democratization of the Council, which will thereby enhance the legitimacy and effectiveness of its decisions on critical issues of global peace and security. My delegation is also of the strong view that the reform of the Security Council must also touch on the proper relationship between the Council and the General Assembly. The Charter of the United Nations assigns to the Security Council primary, but not exclusive, responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security; hence, there is also a role here for the General Assembly. Unfortunately, however, the voice of the General Assembly, which is the most democratic organ of the United Nations, is often drowned out by that of the Security Council on issues of global peace and security. On the specific issues of the composition and size of the Council, my delegation continues to assert that the current anomaly of African non-representation in the permanent membership category must be corrected as a matter of urgency, as our continent, with its 53 Member States, collectively constitutes almost one third of the entire membership of the United Nations. In this context, the decision of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to seek two permanent seats for Africa in a reformed and expanded Council can simply not be ignored. The demand is legitimate, credible and made with a full sense of responsibility and relevance in the international system. It deserves the full support of all Member States. It is our deep conviction that a world without the United Nations would be inconceivable, especially in the wake of renewed conflicts in several parts of the globe. In this regard, it is a matter of concern that Africa accounts for a disproportionate share of global conflicts, with their implications for human suffering and deprivation. The scale of human tragedies arising from conflicts within and among African States is alarming. We are pleased to note that the Security Council is currently giving special consideration to the causes of conflict in our continent, with a view to identifying how the international community could work in partnership with us to resolve them. This initiative to focus attention on the need for a renewed and concerted international effort to promote peace and stability in our continent is clearly unprecedented and deserves our commendation. Nigeria?s role in the furtherance of the objectives of the United Nations, especially in the field of peacekeeping and peace-building, is well known. We have made great efforts in the promotion of peaceful resolution of conflicts in parts of Africa where innocent lives and property have been dangerously at risk. Nigeria has joined hands with like-minded States to restore law and order. This was the case in Liberia and, most recently, in Sierra Leone, where President Tejan Kabbah was restored to his position as the democratically elected President in March this year. This was the first time in the recent history of Africa that a democratically elected regime overthrown by a military coup was restored as a result of a collective action in a subregion. As the current Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Nigeria is proud to have provided the leadership within the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) for the collective subregional efforts which resulted in that epoch-making event. I should like to take this opportunity to express our deep gratitude to the international community for its overwhelming support during the crisis, which helped, in no small measure, to demoralize the rebel forces and speed up the restoration of democracy and the rule of law in Sierra Leone. The war in Sierra Leone is over; the same can be said of Liberia, but the threat remains. We therefore urge the international community and international humanitarian organizations to take an active interest in rehabilitation efforts in the two countries. A lot remains to be done there. Currently our subregional grouping, through its Committee of Seven, is actively involved in restoring peace in Guinea-Bissau, where a rebel group took up arms against the elected Government. It joined efforts with like-minded groups and a result a ceasefire was agreed upon a few weeks ago. We are optimistic that this agreement will hold. 8 We have also helped to create within the Organization of African Unity a continent-wide Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution. This facility enjoys wide support. However, it has been unable to live up to the lofty ideals for which it was set up, owing largely to inadequate resources in terms of military hardware and funding. We invite the international community and other interested bodies to support the cause of peace and security in Africa through the OAU regional and subregional instruments for conflict prevention, management and resolution. Nigeria is disturbed by the escalation of terrorist activities in many parts of the world. The recent tragic bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, where some 260 innocent lives were lost, have brought home graphically to us all the fact that no country or society is immune from the activities of terrorists. We condemn these bombings. Terrorism is one of the most heinous crimes against humanity. It constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security. We must enhance international cooperation to combat and eliminate it in all its manifestations. We must reflect our common concern for this problem through support for an international convention on terrorism. My Administration came to the helm in Nigeria last June and began its short tenure with a few clear-cut objectives and policy thrusts. The most important is the design and implementation of a transparent, free and all- inclusive programme of transition to civil rule within the shortest time-frame. This decision was welcomed by the political class. Our goal is to return our country to a democratically elected civilian government on 29 May 1999. To this end, we inaugurated the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on 11 August 1998, with full powers to organize and manage the various stages of the electoral process without pressure or interference from any external body or authority. There are no restrictions to the formation of political parties, and several political parties are already seeking registration. The party registration guidelines just issued by INEC emphasize the role of the electorate as the ultimate determinant of the existence and success of political parties. This is democracy par excellence and confirms the confidence of Nigerians in INEC. Furthermore, the Independent National Electoral Commission has published the timetable for the various elections in the Transition Programme, beginning with the local government elections in December 1998 and culminating in the presidential elections scheduled for 27 February 1999. We are committed to sustaining the independence, integrity and transparency of INEC. Every stage of the elections may be freely observed by international monitors from the United Nations, the Commonwealth and other interested bodies. These measures will ensure the credibility and integrity of the whole electoral process. In this regard, we note with satisfaction that both the United Nations and the Commonwealth have already dispatched assessment teams to Nigeria to meet with INEC officials with a view to reaching agreement on the modalities and the substance of cooperation between the Commission and the two organizations. The draft constitution presented by the National Constitutional Conference in 1995 has now been published and will be ready for wide circulation in due course. All comments and views arising from the public will be duly presented for consideration prior to promulgation. I am aware that on the question of human rights observance, Nigeria has recently been the subject of international attention. It is the objective of my administration, with the support and understanding of the international community, to move Nigeria in the direction of fullest respect for fundamental human rights, good governance, accountability and rule of law. This commitment to human rights has been amply demonstrated by the release of political detainees, the granting of pardons to some convicted persons and the withdrawal of charges against others. The general level of individual freedom, in particular freedom of expression and association, has greatly improved. The cases of people who are being detained and have not been arraigned before the courts and of a certain class of persons already convicted for offences are being examined, and appropriate decisions will be taken. Already, the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice of the Federation, in conjunction with the Minister of Internal Affairs and the National Commission on Human Rights of Nigeria, have zoned the country for the purpose of accelerating the decongestion of prisons. We wish to reiterate our call on those Nigerians who are currently in self-imposed exile to return and participate in the political and economic development of our country. With our quest to improve our socio- economic infrastructure and climate for governance, we will conduct a census of Nigerian professionals and those 9 with special talents currently excelling worldwide with a view to harnessing all of the country?s human resources. I have also visited all our military formations to reconfirm the commitment of the armed forces and police to the democratization programme. The officers and men of the Nigerian armed forces and police, like the majority of our people, yearn for democracy in a united and peaceful country. They are overwhelmingly in support of our democratization programme. I stand before this body as the leader of a country which is now fully engaged in a genuine and irreversible process of transition to democracy. Therefore, having honoured our commitment to the restoration of the fundamental human rights and freedoms of our people and advanced the prospects of democratization in Nigeria, we now call on the Western countries to lift the sanctions which some of them have imposed on our country. Today, perhaps more than ever before, we require the support and understanding of all the friends of Nigeria and the international community as a whole to help us in the implementation of our programmes and policies aimed at uplifting the living standards of our people. In conclusion, a silent but peaceful revolution is taking place in Nigeria. Our people are determined to ensure that sustainable democratic governance is established in the country. Nigeria is clearly at the threshold of a new beginning in its domestic political and socio-economic structure and its foreign relations agenda. This is the time, therefore, for the international community to give the necessary encouragement and support for our endeavours.  It gives me great pleasure to extend to Mr. Opertti and his friendly country, on behalf of the State of Kuwait, our sincere congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. We are confident that his extensive and incisive knowledge of international affairs will greatly help him to guide the Assembly?s deliberations to success. Let me assure him of our delegation?s willingness and desire to cooperate with him in a businesslike and constructive manner in order to achieve all the objectives of this session. I also wish to express our appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his remarkable stewardship of the previous session. Allow me take this opportunity to commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless efforts to reform the United Nations, to restructure it, and to streamline and revitalize it in various fields, with a view to making it responsive to the demands and challenges of the twenty-first century. In this regard, we welcome the statement made by the Secretary-General before the general debate, when he presented his report on the work of the Organization. We note with satisfaction that some essential proposals for reform presented by the Secretary-General have been implemented. We hope that the reform exercise will continue with the full backing of all Member States. The reform of the Organization and the enhancement of its effectiveness for the fulfilment of its objectives and the attainment of its priorities depend in large measure on the political will of Member States and the extent of their commitment to their obligations under the Charter and the resolutions of its various organs. We consider it unrealistic to expect the United Nations to deliver more while we provide less. Frankly, Kuwait feels that the success of the reform exercise hinges primarily on the availability of adequate funding for the various mandated activities. Such funding depends on the payment by all Member States of their assessed contributions to both the regular budget and the peacekeeping budget. In this regard, I am pleased to report that the State of Kuwait continues to fulfil its financial obligations in full and on time. It is our fervent hope that this obligation will be honoured by all Member States of the Organization. The reform and restructuring of United Nations organs has become a practical necessity required for the common interest of all Member States. There is no doubt that the circumstances in which the United Nations was established over 50 years ago have changed, and that vast developments which could not be overlooked have occurred at various international and regional levels. Therefore, Kuwait is in favour of restructuring the Security Council so that its composition and membership reflect current political and economic realities. The change should also ensure greater efficiency in the discharge of the primary responsibilities of the Council, as set forth in the Charter, regarding the maintenance of international peace and security. It is clear now, after five years of debate in the Working Group on the expansion of the membership of the Security Council and the reform of its methods of work, that reaching a consensus on the optimum increase in membership is not an easy matter. Deep differences still exist among Member States. Nonetheless, we remain hopeful that reaching an agreement is still possible. In this context, we wish to emphasize the need to improve the methods and procedures of work of the Council to ensure enhanced transparency and wider involvement in the decision-making process. The comprehensive paper submitted by the Non-Aligned Movement on 11 March 1997 to the Working Group constitutes an appropriate basis for working out an agreement on the procedures to be adopted and incorporated into the rules of procedure of the Council. As we stand at the threshold of the twenty-first century, our world is witnessing the emergence of a multitude of problems and issues whose implications transcend national and geographical boundaries. Their inherent dangers can threaten national and international security. Unless curbed, such hazards will undermine the achievements made thus far in the environmental, social and economic spheres. Among such problems — without being exhaustive — are terrorism, the arms race, narcotic drugs, environmental degradation, poverty, human rights violations, massacres and genocide. 17 In this context, Kuwait wishes to reaffirm its categorical denunciation and rejection of all forms of violence and terrorism, irrespective of their source. We support all collective international efforts to confront this phenomenon, including the apprehension and trial of the perpetrators of these crimes. Kuwait condemns the terrorist acts perpetrated against the United States embassy buildings in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam last August and extends heartfelt condolences and sympathy to the families of the victims of those tragic incidents. In the area of disarmament, we welcome the progress made thus far with regard to the Convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. When we in Kuwait talk about landmines, we have in our minds the bitter memory of the destructive impact of the millions of mines planted throughout Kuwait by the invading Iraqi forces. Those mines claimed the lives of hundreds of innocent children, women and elderly people. It took painstaking efforts, in which many States participated, to remove those mines. Kuwait had to expend great efforts and vast sums on the clearance operations. We therefore call on the international community to pursue its efforts to eliminate anti-personnel mines. Kuwait also encourages the movement towards curbing the arms race and developing controls and rules that contribute to tension reduction in all volatile and conflict-ridden regions, especially the Middle East, South Asia and the Indian subcontinent. A significant development in international efforts to combat crimes of genocide and massacres committed during conflicts and wars was the recent adoption of the Statute of the International Criminal Court in Rome last July. It is our hope that the Court will live up to the legitimate aspirations of the world community in trying all perpetrators of war crimes or crimes against humanity and in serving as an effective deterrent against serious violations of international humanitarian law. On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Kuwait calls for greater consolidation of international efforts, to ensure wider respect for and protection of the human rights consecrated in the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration. We maintain that it is the duty of all States, irrespective of their political, economic or cultural systems, to protect and promote those rights, with a view to ensuring the dignity of the human being and his or her rights to freedom of expression and belief. In the area of the fight against narcotic drugs, we believe that the efforts of the United Nations and of other competent international institutions to combat this pernicious phenomenon, and to minimize the illicit sale, trade and abuse of drugs should be supported and strengthened. In this regard, we welcome the Political Declaration adopted at the conclusion of the twentieth special session of the General Assembly, held last June. We are hopeful that the steps agreed to then will be translated into effective concrete measures to stem the tide of this phenomenon, which poses severe threats to human health and to the dignity and aspirations of millions of people and their families, as well as to the stability and independence of States. The State of Kuwait has the honour of holding the chairmanship of the current session of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which was established in 1981. Since its inception, the GCC has been working steadily to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of its peoples, who share a common view of their destiny and future. Leaders of the GCC member States hold annual summits to examine and review a wide range of issues and events that concern the family of the GCC community and have an impact on regional security and stability. A major issue on the agenda of the summit conferences in this regard is the implementation by Iraq of its obligations set forth in the Security Council resolutions relating to its invasion of the State of Kuwait. Therefore, the Gulf Cooperation Council leaders attached great importance to this question in their last summit, held in December 1997 in Kuwait. The final statement issued by that summit reflected a Gulf vision of the future modalities for establishing peace and stability in the region. It also outlined the conditions that must be met by Iraq in order to enable it to reclaim its normal position within the ranks of the international community. Let me cite the following excerpt from the Gulf Cooperation Council summit statement: “The Supreme Council reaffirms the necessity for the Government of Iraq to implement all relevant Security Council resolutions without selectivity, especially those relating to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction that remain in Iraq?s 18 possession, the release of Kuwaiti and third country prisoners, the return of all Kuwaiti property and compliance with Security Council resolution 949 (1994) by refraining from any act of aggression or provocation against neighbouring States. It also stresses that the invasion and occupation of the State of Kuwait by Iraq was a breach of inter-Arab and international treaties. Therefore, Iraq must solemnly acknowledge that by its occupation of the State of Kuwait, it violated the Charter of the League of Arab States, the Joint Arab Defence Treaty and the Charter of the United Nations. The Supreme Council invites Iraq to take the necessary steps to demonstrate its good intentions towards the State of Kuwait and other States in the region in both word and deed, with a view to sparing the region the horrors of another similar catastrophe and to ensuring security and stability for all States of the region. It reaffirms its support for the United Nations Special Commission in charge of the elimination of Iraq?s weapons of mass destruction, and for its Executive Chairman, with the intention of enabling it to fulfil its mandate, and invites the Government of Iraq to cooperate in earnest with the Special Commission without any restrictions or conditions. It stresses the need for Iraq to carry out all relevant Security Council resolutions with a view to mitigating sanctions and alleviating the suffering of the Iraqi people, a suffering with which member States of the Supreme Council are sympathetic, thus prompting them to welcome the oil-for-food formula as a means of providing food and medical drugs to the brotherly people of Iraq. It reaffirms its firm position that the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Iraq must be preserved.” In addition to this crystal clear position of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, the Non-Aligned Movement, at its recent summit in South Africa, underscored the need for Iraq to complete its implementation of all relevant Security Council resolutions. The same call was made earlier by the leaders of the Muslim countries when they convened their summit meeting in Tehran last December. Despite those legitimate demands and sincere calls to Iraq to respond favourably to and to put into effect the resolutions of international legitimacy, Iraq still persists in disregarding those calls and in challenging the Security Council resolutions. It claims that it has carried out what it is required to do. How can such claims be reconciled with the fact that until now we have not yet heard from Iraq any declaration or seen any initiative suggesting that it regrets what it has done? In fact, convenient selectivity is the dominant feature of Iraq?s approach in addressing the resolutions and demands of international legitimacy. The most recent crisis is perhaps a good example of the Government of Iraq?s procrastination and its breach of Security Council resolutions and of the Memorandum of Understanding it signed with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Such crises, which are periodically triggered by the Iraqi Government in its attempts to disavow and circumvent its legal obligations, have all failed thanks to the solid coherence and unity of position of the members of the Security Council, which insist on full compliance by Iraq with the relevant Security Council resolutions. There is no doubt that all these crises unfortunately contribute to the prolongation of the sanctions, for which the Government of Iraq alone bears responsibility. Accordingly, we call upon the international community to maintain its pressure on Iraq in order to force it to comply with all relevant resolutions of international legitimacy, to release all Kuwaiti prisoners and other detainees and to account for the missing persons. This is a long-standing humanitarian problem. Its continuation causes more pain and suffering for the affected families and the people of Kuwait, who remain hopeful for the return of their loved ones. It is our hope that this question will be resolved once and for all, in accordance with the traditions of Islam and the provisions of the relevant Security Council resolutions. The events of the past two decades in the Arabian Gulf region have demonstrated the need for building a regional system on the basis of full and mutual respect for the principles of sovereignty of all States, non- interference in the domestic affairs of others, non-use or threat of use of force, the right of each State to choose its own political, economic and social system, the sovereignty of each State over its natural resources and the importance of resort to peaceful negotiation for the resolution of disputes which may arise between them. Having said that, and in view of Kuwait?s belief in the inalienable rights of our sister State of the United Arab Emirates to the three islands of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, we wish to reaffirm our commitment to and support for the final statement issued by the Kuwait summit of Gulf Cooperation Council member States last December. Kuwait follows with great interest and concern the risks of the current stalemate in the Middle East peace process, which may threaten it with collapse and complete 19 failure due to the intransigent policies of the present Israeli Government, which persists in rejecting the implementation of accords concluded with the Palestinian National Authority and disclaiming the operational principles and framework of the entire peace process, primarily Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the principle of land for peace. This provocative policy which is pursued by Israel?s Government not only undermines the peace process but also creates a general sense of despair and frustration. It also destroys all efforts to build mutual confidence between the parties concerned. It is a push towards confrontation, tension, violence and instability throughout the region. Therefore, we demand that the Israeli Government halt its illegal policy of constructing settlements, confiscating land and demolishing houses. Israel should also cease taking unilateral measures to create faits accomplis on the ground inside the occupied territories. Instead, Israel should implement the United Nations resolutions and fulfil its pledges and accords signed with the Palestinian Authority within the framework of the peace process with a view to ensuring the attainment of all legitimate political rights of the Palestinian people, including its right to self- determination and to the establishment of its independent state on its national territory with Jerusalem as its capital. Here, we stress the need to halt the unabating Israeli measures aimed at changing the physical features of the city of Jerusalem and transforming its legal status. We condemn the Israeli Government?s decision last June to expand the municipal boundaries of the Holy City. We call upon the United Nations and the international community to fulfil their legal and political obligations in order to force Israel to comply with Security Council and General Assembly resolutions on Jerusalem and to preserve its Arab, Muslim and religious character. In the same vein, we renew our call to the two sponsors of the peace process, especially the United States, to redouble their efforts to salvage the peace process and to bring pressure to bear on Israel to resume negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track from the point at which they stopped, with a view to ensuring full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Arab Golan, as well as its complete and unconditional withdrawal in accordance with Security Council resolution 425 (1978) from southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa. Indeed, durable, just and comprehensive peace based on United Nations resolutions and the land-for-peace principle is the only guarantee for meeting the aspirations of the peoples of the region for a new era of peaceful coexistence and accelerated economic and social development. The tragic situations that prevail in Somalia and Afghanistan as a result of civil and ethnic conflicts that brought suffering to their peoples cause us concern. Kuwait, by virtue of its historical bonds with these two countries, reiterates its appeals to all warring parties and factions there to put an end to acts of violence and senseless bloodshed. We call upon them to respond immediately to regional and international appeals and initiatives for dialogue and negotiation in order to resolve their differences and to achieve overall national reconciliation. This would allow them to channel their potentialities towards the goals of development and the reconstruction of what these conflicts have destroyed. In condemning the killing of the Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan, Kuwait would like to extend its sincere condolences to the people and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and to the families of the victims of this tragic incident. We appeal to both the Islamic Republic of Iran and Afghanistan to be calm, exercise self-restraint and resolve their disputes through dialogue and negotiation instead of confrontation. While we appreciate the Government of Iran?s ability to handle the crisis in a way that will spare the two Muslim peoples the dire consequences of a war whose consequences we cannot predict, Kuwait supports the endeavours of the Security Council to achieve peace in the area. On the international plane, while we applaud the international efforts to ensure full and strict implementation of the Dayton accords to bring about peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we regret the aggressive practices of the Serb forces, including the systematic uprooting and “ethnic cleansing” of the Muslim population in the province of Kosovo. We urge the international community to maintain its efforts to put an end to these inhumane practices in order to ensure the right of the native population of that province to a life of dignity and freedom. In Africa, we are witnessing with deep regret the continuation of conflicts and civil wars in several States. These hostilities jeopardize the security and stability of many African States and strain their much needed energies and resources. Kuwait supports the efforts of the international community to bring about peace and security 20 and to provide the means that help the African peoples and States to achieve their aspirations for economic development and to overcome the problems and difficulties that they face in various fields. We also welcome the role played by the Security Council in examining the situation in the African continent on a periodic basis. Furthermore, we commend President Nelson Mandela for the role that he assumed in this regard as Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement. The world economic scene is currently going through severe turbulence and turmoil that have touched off and worsened economic and social crises in many countries, especially the developing ones. The major threat to the world economy is no longer represented by inflation, but by recession, stagnation and unemployment. Therefore, we call for concerted international action to redress those difficulties, which have adverse implications for everybody. National plans and programmes capable of addressing the underlying causes of these volatile situations should be established, and help with economic aid to the affected States should be forthcoming from international monetary institutions in order to help them rectify their economic systems and restore their vitality. In this regard, Kuwait, for its part, continued to provide economic assistance by financing many development projects in the developing countries through the Kuwait fund for development, despite the adverse impact on our economy of depressed oil prices, which plummeted this year to their lowest levels. Adherence to the noble goals and principles of the United Nations Charter, action in accordance with its provisions and the common endeavour to promote and bolster them are essential for strengthening the United Nations capabilities for facing the challenges of the next century. This will also help us in the crystallization of a new world order in which dialogue and cooperation can prevail, and in which conflicts and hostilities would disappear. It would also encourage active participation by all in strengthening the pillars of peace and stability, in consolidating all efforts for the enrichment of human civilization and in the fulfilment of the aspirations of all peoples for peace, security, freedom and justice.  I wish first to extend to the President my warm congratulations on his assumption of the conduct of the current session. Uruguay has indeed a major role to play in international developments, both at the regional and the international level. I also wish to congratulate the current President?s predecessor, Mr. Udovenko, for his performance during the fifty-second session. My congratulations and support are also addressed to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has deployed enormous efforts not only to keep United Nations services running, but also to further enhance their efficiency through the ongoing reform process. His political skills have been demonstrated in settling disputes which threaten international peace and security. The Austrian Foreign Minister delivered a statement on behalf of the European Union to which my Government fully subscribes. I would like to elaborate further on some particular issues. 27 Greece consistently endeavours for peace and security — security in political and socio-economic terms, security through human dignity and through international law and order. In that spirit, Greece welcomes the establishment by the Rome Conference of an International Criminal Court. We hope that the Preparatory Committee, to convene in the wake of the Conference, will decisively tackle the remaining definition aspects of the crime of aggression. Greece considers disarmament and non-proliferation to be guarantees of international peace. In the nuclear field, we welcome two significant developments: the signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the decision reached in Geneva to negotiate a treaty banning the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons and other explosive nuclear devices. My country shares the general concern about nuclear tests. We also concur with the general recommendations on the issue, namely, adherence to the comprehensive test ban and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, as well as compliance with the international rules. Bacteriological and toxin weapons, known as the nuclear weapons of the poor, remain a threat to humanity. Reinforcement of the relevant Convention remains an urgent priority. The Ottawa Treaty on anti-personnel landmines made history by totally banning their use. We urge those countries, particularly in the sensitive south-eastern European area, that have yet to accede to this Treaty to seriously consider the humanitarian aspect of this exercise and act accordingly. Peacekeeping plays a major role in staving off crises. Greece has taken an active part in a wide range of United Nations operations, such as the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission, and in the Western Sahara, in Georgia, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as in the United Nations humanitarian mission in Iraq and Operation ALBA in Albania. Greece also provides annually a significant financial contribution to the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus. The United Nations needs adequate resources and means in order to carry out its mandate. Greece has voluntarily accepted a higher percentage in the scale of assessments and pays its contributions to the Organization in full and on time. Combating drugs is a high political priority for the Greek Government. Greece closely followed the proceedings of the General Assembly?s special session on the international drug problem. Last June, my country?s commitment in the fight against drugs was reflected in its chairing the regional Dublin Group formation for the Balkans and the near Middle East. From its establishment, the modern Greek State has proclaimed that no discrimination based on colour, race or ethnic origin would be tolerated on its territory, while the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all individuals who set foot on it would be fully protected. We have made a tradition of adhering to, implementing and supporting compliance with the human rights norms set by United Nations instruments and major conventions. The restructuring and new membership of the Security Council rightly elicit our attention. The enlargement of the Security Council should be based both on the criteria of the United Nations Charter and on the ongoing realities. We understand that major regional organizations, such as the European Union, the Non- Aligned Movement, the Arab League, the Organization of American States, the Organization of African Unity, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Southern African Development Community, the South Pacific Forum and other important forums have a special responsibility in identifying those countries which, by evident commitment to principles enshrined in the Charter, may further subscribe and contribute to its goals. On the other hand, 53 years after the signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco, we have to acknowledge the new realities, such as the collapse of the bipolar system and the emergence of new stabilizing factors all over the world. The future of this body of countries with limited membership, regardless of their geographical location or ideological orientation, calls for our consideration. We hope that a renewed effort of the Open-ended Working Group, under your guidance, Sir, will eventually reach a compromise solution. Concerning the world economy, I share the view that globalization presents us with an array of opportunities and potential benefits. Nevertheless, it also entails increased risks. The international community has to make full use of the international financial institutions and instruments to weather crises and respond to the 28 challenges of globalization. No effort should be spared to help developing countries, and in particular the least developed among them, to avoid marginalization through globalization. Two very important aspects of the effort to better integrate developing countries into the world economy merit our consideration: first, the rapid and determined extension of debt relief, within the terms of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative; and secondly, improved market access so that developing countries can effectively benefit from the trade opportunities that the Uruguay Round offers. In this respect, financing for development assistance remains an additional element of paramount importance. In the field of environment and sustainable development, Greece supports the work of the appropriate United Nations Commission. The significance of this forum invites me to recall a grave problem: the threat to the environment resulting from the expansion of nuclear-power production plants, particularly when they are located in areas subject to earthquakes, neighbouring sea traffic and inadequate infrastructure. In addition, we are deeply concerned by the increasing stockpiling of nuclear wastes and shipments of radioactive materials, threatening the lives and properties of developing countries? populations, in particular those of the vast South Pacific area. Turning to my country?s presence in regional organizations, may I recall the active role played by Greece in the Council of Europe through the Committee of Ministers, which it currently chairs. Among the issues on its agenda, I note the European Court of Human Rights, which will enhance the protection of human rights at the European level. In the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Greece is involved in every effort aimed at promoting the notion of comprehensive security. With regard to activities in the human dimension, I simply mention my country?s contribution in the field of elections observation. Greece was happy to attend, as a guest, the twelfth Non-Aligned Movement summit held recently in Durban, South Africa. Its keynote was clearly the shape and scope that a movement born in a bipolar, confrontational world could claim in the coming millennium, ushered in by globalization. The message of the Durban declaration deserves our attention and consideration. A year has elapsed since I expressed in this very forum the hope that Turkey would finally abandon its intransigent policies on Cyprus. It has proven to be a vain hope. This was a year of stagnation and frustration. Frustrated have been the efforts of Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his Special Adviser, Mr. Cordovez, to relaunch the intercommunal talks. Special envoys from several countries, including members of the Security Council, hoping to unblock the situation, came back frustrated from Ankara and the occupied part of Cyprus. Frustrated remain the hopes of the European Union to bring the Turkish Cypriot together with the Greek Cypriot in a prosperous State of Cyprus that is a member of the European family. The reaction from Ankara, obediently echoed by the Turkish Cypriot leadership, has been one of harsh rejection, either in terms of a flat negation or by imposing conditions tantamount to cancelling what has been desired by the international community, prescribed by United Nations resolutions and even accepted by the Turkish Cypriot leadership itself. Such an attitude of rejection is easily explained by the notorious designs of the Turkish Government to effect the partition of Cyprus. Mr. Ecevit, Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey, has on several occasions said that the Cyprus question was resolved once and for all by his country?s armed forces? invasion in 1974. Twenty-four years after the invasion, Cyprus remains a divided island and the Turkish occupation forces increase their presence and weaponry, even denying their victims the right to effectively defend themselves. Twenty-four years is enough. It is time for the international community to strongly support the Secretary-General in fulfilling his mandate of bringing the two communities to the negotiating table to initiate a dialogue on gradual disarmament towards the complete demilitarization of the island. Greece wishes to establish good-neighbourly relations with Turkey, based on the principles of international law and respect for international treaties. The International Court of Justice at The Hague, whose compulsory jurisdiction has been accepted by Greece, is the appropriate legal forum for the settlement of problems in our relations. A positive response by Turkey to that effect would constitute a step towards the beginning of a new period of mutual understanding. 29 Greece pursues a policy promoting stability, good- neighbourly relations, cooperation and economic development in South-Eastern Europe. We participate in international projects or take our own initiatives, in the context of bilateral or multilateral schemes. We offer troops and counselling, funds and food. Greece offers to its neighbours and the region a much needed feeling of trust and security. My country accords a high priority to our relations with Albania. We welcome the efforts of the Albanian Government to further pursue the process of normalization of democratic institutions and its close cooperation with the international community. Greece considers it its duty to stand by Albania in its efforts to overcome the serious difficulties it faces. In the neighbouring Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and more particularly in the area of Kosovo, the situation has reached a critical point. The vicious circle of the use of force must be halted. The refugees and displaced persons must be allowed to return to their homes safely, without delay. Greece has sent humanitarian assistance to alleviate the plight of the refugees in northern Albania. We welcome the setting up of the Albanian negotiating group, and support the immediate start of negotiations with a view to arriving, as soon as possible, at a peaceful and negotiated solution on the future autonomy status of Kosovo, within the internationally recognized borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Terrorist acts and indiscriminate and disproportionate repression are unacceptable. Greece has actively participated, and will actively participate, in all international efforts aimed at securing a peaceful solution in Kosovo. In Bosnia, Greece notes with satisfaction the progress achieved so far in the implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement. We maintain close relations with the Bosnian parties and offer substantial contributions to efforts aimed at ensuring the stability and development of this country. Greek soldiers participate in the Stabilization Force (SFOR) as well as in international observer missions. Important programmes undertaken by the Greek Government in the framework of the donors conference, held in 1997, are about to be completed. In our relations with Bulgaria, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Romania, the promotion of mutually beneficial cooperation in all fields is of paramount importance. In the multilateral field, Greece is committed to, and actively involved in, such regional schemes as the South- Eastern Europe cooperation process, the Royaumont Initiative, the South-East Europe Cooperative Initiative and the Black Sea Economic Cooperation. We note with satisfaction that South-Eastern Europe leaders will meet again this year in Antalya, Turkey, thus consolidating the process we initiated last year in Crete. In the Middle East, the present stagnation underlines the urgent need to reactivate the peace process. Its revival will bring hope for peace and prosperity. Once more, we stress the need for full implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions and agreements, and we urge the parties to make every effort to achieve real peace, which should be a just, lasting and global peace. Greece welcomes any endeavour likely to produce positive results, while supporting the initiatives undertaken by the European Union?s special envoy in the Middle East. Successful meetings organized by the special envoy and the Greek Government bring together prominent Israelis and Palestinians in a conciliatory spirit. These meetings will, hopefully, be institutionalized as the “Athens Dialogue for Peace and Cooperation in the Middle East”. The Mediterranean remains our life companion. We have been the pioneers for the adoption of a European Union Mediterranean policy, accompanied by the Euro- Mediterranean Partnership (MEDA) regulation, through which financial aid to the countries concerned is considerably increased. The African continent is an emerging reality that will affect the future of humanity. However, progress in the fields of political pluralism and economic stabilization has been coupled, over the course of the last year, with regression in the form of ruinous civil wars or border conflicts in a number of African countries. The international community should stand by the African nations and their organizations on the eve of the twenty- first century, advocating the need for good-neighbourly relations and, within the countries themselves, democratic rule, respect for human rights and an open market economy. Greece shares the general concern about the developments in Asia. The financial turmoil is by no means settled. Indeed, it is still sending disturbing vibrations through the European and world economies. Asia can, however, overcome the crisis. Allowing external or internal tensions to drag on, with the prospect of escalation, obviously spells future disaster, in terms of 30 chasing or scaring foreign investment out of the area and of funnelling precious funds to such dangerous and vain projects as the production of weapons of mass destruction. Greece follows closely and contributes actively to the historical process of eastern European countries? reintegration into the European system. Our political credo and vision is that of a Europe without dividing lines and scars from the past. In this context, Greece supports the enlargement of the European Union with the 10 candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe, together with Cyprus, advocating the simultaneous launching of a global and inclusive accession process with all candidate countries. Greece also extends its institutional links and promotes its historical, economic and cultural ties with the Russian Federation and the Ukraine and the other newly independent States in the Caucasus, Black Sea and Central Asia. Our excellent relations with the United States and Canada are further enhanced through political and military cooperation in peacemaking initiatives and peacekeeping activities in South-Eastern Europe, as well as cooperation in preventing and eliminating terrorism. Furthermore, Greece, as a member of the European Union, stands for a broad transatlantic dialogue and the advancement of the New Trans-Atlantic Agenda. Greece has traditional ties of friendship with the countries of Latin America, and, both bilaterally and as a member of the European Union, systematically supports ongoing, comprehensive dialogue and cooperation with them. Until very recently Greece had been a recipient of development assistance, but for three years now we have been an important contributor, equal to the standards of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). We may not be such a wealthy country, but we are trying to grant effective and qualitative assistance to those interested in it and in need of it, using our experience to make this as beneficial as possible, supporting the struggle against poverty and famine and for economic and social development, and also trying to help promote human rights, democracy and institutions of civil society. I would like also to refer briefly to an issue which is of particular concern to my country, the Olympic Games. Inspired by the Olympic Ideal, Greece presented on 4 February 1998 to the International Olympic Committee in Nagano, Japan, a comprehensive proposal outlining a set of organizational structures and a broad range of activities aimed at the practical realization of an Olympic Truce at the Athens Games of 2004 and at the strengthening of the role of the Olympic Movement. In order to support these important activities, Greece proposed the establishment of an international centre for the Olympic Truce, at the very site of ancient Olympia. Further, Greece took the initiative and proposed the creation of a cultural Olympics for the first time in contemporary world. This would strengthen dialogue among different cultures the world over. This proposal was welcomed by the International Olympic Committee, and preparatory work has already started between the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the International Olympic Committee and the Greek Government. I would like to spare the delegates another pre- electoral speech. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands preceded me, I had to scale down my speech and become very modest, but I cannot avoid referring to the candidacy of Greece for the 1999-2000 term for one of the two non-permanent seats allocated to the Group of Western European and Other States on the Security Council. My Government has legitimate and justified ambitions for requesting the support of United Nations member countries to such a distinction. Our long-standing foreign policy is dedicated to world peace and security, to the trend of decolonization and self-determination, to assisting developing and less developed countries and to respect for international law and human rights. We condemn terrorism in all its forms. We are in favour of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of all United Nations Member States and of the implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Charter, including the democratic principle of fair and balanced representation of all Member States in the various organs and agencies of the United Nations. I would like to draw the honourable delegates? attention to this last principle. In the Western European Group, a situation is occurring in which very few members — five of them — have by now served during 44 of the 52 years of this Organization?s existence. Small and average-sized countries should also have a chance to be present on the Security Council, and I am proud to 31 represent one of those average-sized countries, as I propose my country?s candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council.  On behalf of the people and the Government of Papua New Guinea, I wish to join previous speakers in congratulating you, Mr. President, on your election to your important post. Your unanimous election as President of the General Assembly shows the esteem in which the international community holds both you, personally, and your country, Uruguay. The Papua New Guinea delegation is confident that you will guide this fifty-third session of the General Assembly to a successful conclusion. May I also take this opportunity, through you, to express my delegationâs sincere appreciation to your predecessor, the former Foreign Minister of Ukraine, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his outstanding stewardship in facilitating the work of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly. We would also like to place on record our appreciation to the Secretary-General and the Secretariat staff for the care they put into the planning of the affairs of our Organization. This is the first occasion on which I have addressed the General Assembly. The year since I was elected Prime Minister has been a year of great challenge in which my Government has been confronted with problems associated with natural disasters and those that have resulted from many years of neglect. The realities of life in the rapidly shrinking world mean that a partnership must, in practice, be turned into something practical and viewed in a much broader global perspective as an element of a worldwide partnership in managing and, where possible, directing change. The point is brought home by a series of natural disasters which have affected Papua New Guinea over the past year. First came the drought caused by the El NiÃ±o effect, and then followed frosts, which led to severe food shortages in many different parts of the country. Then came the tsunami which completely destroyed villages in the Aitape area of the Sandaun province on the north coast of the mainland, killing more than 2,100 people, mainly children and women, and injuring many more. In between came floods and landslides, which caused death and destruction in several places. Meanwhile, people 11 around Rabaul continue to cope with the effects and try to rebuild in the aftermath of the 1994 volcanic eruptions. The drought, in particular, showed that people and States throughout the world have to be partners in dealing with the causes of disasters arising from climatic or other forms of environmental change. The prompt and generous response to the series of natural disasters by our neighbours and friends in many different countries showed that they are truly our partners in dealing with the effects of such changes. Like other developing countries, Papua New Guinea faces the challenge of providing its people with opportunities to improve both the material standard of living and the quality of life. My Government has had to address these multiple changes while dealing with natural disasters and carrying out a comprehensive programme of structural adjustment. In doing so, we are working hard to make sure that private initiative contributes to public welfare and national development, as it can and should, by focusing on trimming the public sector so that State resources are used where they can be most effective. The result has been a stable economy with continuing economic growth. It has been achieved and is being maintained despite the negative impact on trade and investment prospects arising from the economic crisis affecting so many of our East Asian neighbours. The lesson we draw from the experience is that the world is truly becoming a global community. The challenge we face is to develop a global partnership â€” strong, focused, and determined enough to manage and, where possible, to direct change. The lesson has obvious implications for a world in which some countries experience â€œaid fatigueâ€, while increasing numbers of people elsewhere fall and remain below the poverty line, where survival itself is the most pressing issue. I know that with its small, open economy, my countryâs development is directly influenced by developments in world markets for our products. Currently, my country is suffering from the economic crisis experienced by our major trading partners, in which we are forced to undertake significant reform programmes to protect our economy and our people. In this regard, we turn our attention to international financial institutions to help us restructure our economy. Unfortunately, we have had mixed reactions from them. Some of them, including the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank, have been very positive in their discussions with us, while others appear to be slow in responding. This leads me to think that sometimes some of these organizations are insensitive and do not appreciate the difficulties and hardships faced by our people without their help. This year, despite the El NiÃ±o drought and other natural disasters that devastated my country, Papua New Guinea, we have continued to become more vigilant to these challenges and to take remedial measures. Notwithstanding the hardship our economy is experiencing because of the international economic crisis, the value of our currency has consistently been recovering. For Papua New Guinea to realize and sustain its current reform programmes, it has to secure external financial support. The challenge is to forge a new global partnership for change â€” a partnership in which both developed and developing countries join together to address the issues that the global community will face in the twenty-first century. This partnership will be necessary if the shared hopes of humanity for peace, justice and a better way of life are to progress. I see my Governmentâs foreign policy of partnership in the Asia-Pacific as a building block for the global partnership on which the future depends. For developing countries in particular, there is really no alternative way. In facing the challenge of improving both the material standards of living and the quality of life of our people, we are carrying out comprehensive programmes of structural adjustment and changing our focus so that both private and State resources can be directed to social welfare and national development. Despite the negative effects of the current global crisis, we are achieving a stable economy, stabilizing our currency and attracting investments. When my Government came into office in July 1997, my priority was the resolution of the nine-year-old Bougainville conflict, which had caused terrible suffering and the loss of lives and property. Three factors â€” the desire of the men and especially the women of Bougainville to end the fighting, my desire for a consensus resolution and the moral and practical support of Australia and New Zealand â€” led to a meeting in 12 Burnham, New Zealand, in October 1997 where a truce was signed. As an integral part of the truce, my Government approached our friends in the region to form an unarmed and neutral regional Truce Monitoring Group. The Government of the Solomon Islands â€” which played a very constructive role in the processes â€” New Zealand, Australia, Fiji and Vanuatu provided personnel to the Truce Monitoring Group, and its presence helped mutual confidence-building and made people feel safe. The peace monitoring group that took over on 1 May this year continues to provide a positive role in maintaining and consolidating peace. In March this year, I met in Lincoln, New Zealand, with the main Bougainvillean parties involved in the conflict, and we agreed that a permanent and irrevocable ceasefire should take effect from 30 April 1998. Proceeding on a bipartisan-national basis and in close consultation with all of the major Bougainville parties, I agreed that the State would approach the Security Council to endorse the Lincoln Agreement on Peace, Security and Development on Bougainville. I also requested that the Council send a small observer mission to monitor and report on developments. As the internationally recognized representatives of all of the people of Papua New Guinea and being proud of Papua New Guineaâs independence and sovereignty, we made these requests with mixed feelings, but with determination made strong by our faith in the cause of peace. I am pleased to report that the Security Council responded positively to our request, and, through the efforts of other South Pacific Forum missions in New York and others in close cooperation with the Secretary-General, the Observer Mission is now on Bougainville, operating side by side with the personnel of the peacekeeping mission. As I speak, my Government is making arrangements for a Bougainville restoration Government to take office within the framework of our Constitution before the end of this year. At the same time, the people and leaders of Bougainville are performing the traditional ceremonies of reconciliation. Our partners from Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, Japan and the United Nations Development Programme are providing resources for restoration and development. A number of non- governmental organizations, including churches, the Red Cross and Doctors Without Frontiers are also active. My Government is taking practical steps to strengthen civil authority by training Bougainvillean policemen to work in Bougainville. Having begun the processes of peace in Bougainville, we must now do everything we can to make peace work through peaceful means. While the peace process on Bougainville is still fragile, my Government is confident that with the support of all Papua New Guineans and of our neighbours and friends in the international community, it will continue to gain strength. As it gains strength, we expect direct international involvement to become of less importance, decreasing by agreement as mutual confidence and trust consolidates. The Bougainville peace process has shown in a practical and constructive manner how people can seek reconciliation and forgiveness. The Security Council, together with the Secretary- General, have given both moral, and through the Observer Mission, visible and practical support. On a separate though broadly related matter, Papua New Guinea commends the United Nations on 50 years of cooperation in international peacekeeping and reaffirms its commitment to these processes. Papua New Guinea makes a resolute commitment to the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. In doing so, we recognize that like any other institution, the United Nations has limitations. Consistent with our view of the United Nations as a means of promoting global cooperation and partnership to meet the challenges of change in the twenty-first century, Papua New Guinea continues in its strong belief that its moral values and organizations offer hope to humanity. Consistent with our commitment to the United Nations, my Government is actively engaged in bringing our national laws, policies and practices into line with the important declarations and plans of action produced by the United Nations. We give priority to implementing United Nations declarations and plans of action to advance the rights of women and the elimination of child abuse. In common with the other Member countries, we believe that it is timely to bring the United Nations Charter into line with contemporary reality by eliminating references to â€œenemy Statesâ€. Papua New Guinea strongly supports calls for a new Security Council for the new millennium. 13 As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, we endorse the Declaration issued by its thirteenth Summit, held in Durban, South Africa. The Security Council should be reformed and expanded. An effective Security Council should be of a size and composition which matches the enhanced role that the world expects it to play in coordinating global approaches and actions directed to deal with the issues we will all face in the twenty-first century. Consistent with the mutual respect and equity on which partnership must be based, Papua New Guinea believes that all permanent members of the Security Council should have similar privileges and rights. Changing the world from a system of relations between imperial Powers to a partnership between sovereign States through decolonization is among the United Nations greatest achievements. The process will not be completed, as it must be, until the remaining 17 dependent territories have exercised their inalienable right to self-determination. Neither small size nor remoteness should be allowed to qualify or limit their rights. The recently concluded South Pacific Forum, held in Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia, has confirmed its support for that right. As one of the States which has always taken a close interest in the situation and in the rights of the indigenous Kanaks of New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea is pleased to note the progress made in implementing the Matignon Accords, culminating in the recent Agreement to the Noumea Accord. The Noumea Accord will, we believe, provide a sound basis for the future fulfilment of all legitimate political aspirations. We urge all parties to honour both its letter and its spirit. The United Nations should continue to monitor developments in New Caledonia until implementation is complete and self-determination has been achieved. More than 80 per cent of Papua New Guineans live in rural villages, where they depend directly on the land, rivers, lakes and sea for their livelihood. Our national Constitution commits us to use and develop the rich variety of the countryâs natural resources for the common good and the benefit of future generations. In doing so, it upholds the most up-to-date principles of international environmental law. The same provisions also provide a sound basis for domestic policy and law-making. Papua New Guinea has spoken out strongly and worked actively on a wide range of environmental issues. Consistent with our record and ongoing commitment, my Government will shortly be signing and then ratifying the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In line with the importance we attach to such matters, Papua New Guinea is party to conventions arising out of the Rio Summit on environment and development and Agenda 21. My Government will continue to follow and support the future work of the Commission, including efforts to translate and integrate internationally agreed objectives and standards into domestic laws and programmes of action. Like other members of the South Pacific Forum, Papua New Guinea is firmly committed to the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island States. We strongly urge its full implementation. Together with other States in the region, we have joined as partners with distant-water-fishing nations to develop a programme to manage the sustainable use of tuna stocks in the western and central Pacific. The worldâs leading scientists have concluded that the rise in global temperatures poses serious threats, such as sea-level rise and an increase in natural catastrophes, such as the El NiÃ±o phenomenon. Papua New Guinea, together with the small island States in the Pacific, will continue to stress the urgency for developed countries to take a strong lead in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The Kyoto Protocol has paved the way for annex I countries to fulfil their commitments under the Convention on Climate Change and the Protocol itself. We urge those parties to translate their legally binding targets for the reduction of their emissions into concrete action. While it is our firm conviction that there must be a global approach, we cannot support shifting the burden to developing countries as a precondition for the ratification of the Protocol. At the recent South Pacific Forum meeting, our Government, together with other heads of the South Pacific region, confirmed our support for the South Pacific Environmental Programme and the Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) as a key sector. The FFA programme will ensure the maintenance of sustainable fisheries in the region as well as enhance the economic 14 security of coastal States, particularly those economies which are highly dependent on this one resource. This is the International Year of the Ocean. Papua New Guinea will work actively with other South Pacific Missions in New York to commemorate this Year, with particular emphasis on the sustainable use of resources derived from the oceans. With its recent share of national disasters, some of which have taken the ultimate human toll, Papua New Guinea is concerned about climate change, rising sea levels and the urgent need to reduce carbon and other emissions in the atmosphere. Having experienced natural disasters at first hand, I would say that the greatest challenge for the United Nations is to strengthen the global communityâs capacity to respond promptly and effectively to natural disasters. I am sure that my friends from China and Bangladesh, where large areas have recently been devastated by floods, would agree. Papua New Guinea strongly supports the renewal of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction and preparedness and the Yokohama Strategy adopted in 1993. Consistent with our shared commitment to a stable, peaceful and environmentally safe world, my Government supports the objectives of the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We support efforts to ban transboundary movements of radioactive and other hazardous wastes in and through our region and to ensure that damage arising from nuclear explosions is adequately compensated. Together with our partners in the South Pacific Forum, we recently reaffirmed our determination to maintain the South Pacific as a nuclear-free zone. We also expressed our support for the other regional nuclear-free zones, in Africa, South-East Asia and the Latin American and Caribbean region, and the proposed new initiative in Central and South Asia. Like people and Governments throughout the world, we in the South Pacific were seriously concerned about the series of nuclear weapons tests conducted by India and Pakistan. The best course of action would be not only to stop testing now but also to destroy all nuclear weapons. Papua New Guinea believes that the same should apply to all weapons of mass destruction in other parts of the world. Encouraged at the positive signs of progress towards resolving conflicts and securing peace in several areas of tension and concern in Asia and Africa, Papua New Guinea nonetheless remains anxious over recent developments affecting Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea and Ethiopia. We are heartened by the efforts made by the Organization of African Unity to restore peace and stability in the Great Lakes region. Also, we support the initiative of President Nelson Mandela of South Africa to revive a common vision for peace in Africa. Consistent with our commitment to peaceful dialogue between nations, Papua New Guinea condemns those who employ terrorism against innocent people, including women and children. Diplomacy is the means by which States join together as partners and cooperate in bringing about changes to promote peace, development and justice for people both in principle and, even more importantly, in practice. It is therefore vital that diplomats be able to live and work safely, free from the threat of terrorism, such as that practised against American diplomats in Africa. In this connection, following recent events on our common border with Indonesia, my Government would like to make clear its strong and consistent recognition of the sovereignty of Indonesia, including Irian Jaya, and the continuing mutual respect in all aspects of our relationship. In conclusion, I wish to reaffirm Papua New Guineaâs commitments to the United Nations Charter; to the inalienable rights of the independent territories to self- determination, noting the Matignon and Noumea accords for the Kanak people of New Caledonia; the declaration to advance the rights of women and eliminate child abuse; to our determination to maintain global natural disaster preparedness; to work actively in commemorating the Year of the Ocean; to the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol on global warming; and to the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island States. Partnership in promoting change is the key to addressing the challenges that the world will face in the twenty-first century. I believe the challenge for the Member States is to join together to change this Organization for the better so that it will serve as an effective basis for partnership, to address and resolve the issues that lie ahead.   It is my distinct honour and privilege to address this body once again. In doing so, may I take the opportunity to offer, on behalf of the Commonwealth of Dominica, sincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. My thanks are also extended to Ambassador Udovenko, who so ably guided the fifty-second session. Our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has been indefatigable in his efforts to bring about peace in various countries and regions. To him we express our thanks and congratulations. Last year, I extended an invitation to him to visit the Caribbean. He has not yet done so. The invitation remains open. The Caribbean region continues to demonstrate its commitment to the democratic process. Since we last met in this forum the people of several of our States, within the provisions of the existing rules, freely expressed their will as to who should lead them into the new millennium. Our assertion that democracy is alive and well is not a reflection that all is well in the region. The Charter of this Organization imposes an obligation on all its Members to work for the peace, security and economic and social development of all peoples of the world. As we seek to discharge that obligation, it behoves us to be constantly cognizant of those factors and events which would militate against our success. Some of these are natural and unavoidable; others are man-made and regrettable. The Caribbean was only a few days ago severely impacted upon by one such natural disaster, Hurricane Georges. The damage inflicted was extensive, particularly in St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. On their behalf, I urge this body to generously respond to their expressed need for assistance in the reconstruction work. But the Charter obligations of the United Nations call for more than an ad hoc response arrangement. We must first recognize the acute vulnerability of small States to natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, volcanoes, earthquakes and so on, and their intrinsic limitations in mitigating and responding to them. What is being proposed, therefore, is the establishment of a disaster reconstruction fund under the auspices of the United Nations, the resources of which would be available for quick and effective response to the needs of small States post disaster. And there is still more that must be done. Global warming and the greenhouse effect must be halted. There are on the agenda of this fifty-third session of the General Assembly many matters of profound importance to the Commonwealth of Dominica and the Caribbean Community as a whole. These include macroeconomic policy questions on trade and development; the revitalization of the economic growth and development of developing countries; the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty; the protection of the global climate for present and future generations of mankind; and cooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community. That cooperation is nowhere more necessary than in our fight to maintain the integrity of the market for our bananas. Our fight is against some very powerful members of this very United Nations, which seem determined to derail our democracy, upset our efforts to eradicate poverty and undermine the peace and security of our region. The people of the Commonwealth of Dominica and the people of the Caribbean Community look to the United Nations to intervene on their behalf. The people of the Commonwealth of Dominica and the Caribbean Community are firm in their conviction that globalization and trade liberalization cannot be allowed to result in the marginalization and economic disintegration of small developing States. We seek a level playing field on which our people can engage meaningfully in trade and development, rather than be for ever subjected to the aid-and-dependency syndrome. Our expressed desire to hold on to our banana industry, which has served us well, in no way reflects any misunderstanding of the reality of the current trade and economic environment. We in the Commonwealth of Dominica are actively engaged in the diversification of our economy, involving the agricultural, tourism and service sectors. We have made progress towards improving air access to our country and are providing increased opportunities for our children to receive secondary and tertiary education. We consider the recent naming of one of our national parks, Morne Trois Pitons, as a World Heritage site to be a resounding statement of our commitment to the preservation and effective utilization of our environment. It is a source of comfort to us that all this has been achieved in an environment of social and political stability. We must, however, sound the warning bells, as we note with great foreboding the practice by some of deporting to our countries hardened criminals who have learned and practised their trade in their adopted homelands for several decades. In like manner, the unwarranted disruption and dismantling of families through inhumane immigration laws requires the attention of this Organization. I respectfully submit that in all our deliberations and actions, as indeed in every aspect of human endeavour, the aspirations and legitimate expectations of the people must be central. The 21.5 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan aspire to be represented in this body. They have a legitimate expectation that their country, a founding Member of the United Nations, should have its membership restored. We cannot but lend them our support. Ours must be a policy of inclusion. A cursory look at our agenda reveals 21 items dealing with the financing of United Nations peacekeeping or observer missions, all associated with war, threats of war, “ethnic cleansing”, terrorism and the like. This suggests that although much has been achieved, much more must be done. We must focus our attention on the preservation of peace and security, thereby reducing the need for the restoration of peace and security. There should be no compromise in the fight against terrorism, whether it be in Kenya, Tanzania or Northern Ireland. We note and are glad for the encouraging signs emanating from the Middle East. We should take our cue from the famous British politician who said “To jaw-jaw 2 is better than war-war”, and seek to settle our disputes peacefully in the spirit of our Charter. By the time this fifty-third session of the General Assembly comes to a close, many speeches will have been delivered from this podium, articulate, substantive speeches, delivered by men and women who together hold and wield enormous power. The peoples of the world have heard us talk. But is that all they want from us? I submit that the answer is a resounding no. They want action. An agenda that includes 165 items suggests that much work lies ahead of us. Yet I propose one additional task: that the Secretary-General and his able team of professionals subject all of our speeches to detailed scrutiny and analysis and, in keeping with the directive of the Summit of the Americas, let us “put words into deeds”. In this way, we will give the lie to those critics who claim this place is only a talk shop, and demonstrate to them that it is indeed an action station. The Commonwealth of Dominica and the Caribbean Community hold dearly to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. We are firmly committed to working with all Members and nations to bring about an improved quality of life for all the peoples of this world.   The principality of Monaco is particularly pleased that you, Mr. President, are carrying out the high functions and responsibilities of this fifty-third session of our General Assembly. Your election by acclamation bears witness to the confidence that the international community has placed in your personal qualities and in your experience. It is also a manifestation of the respect that Member States have for your country, Uruguay. I would also like to include the newly elected members of the Bureau in my cordial congratulations to you and in the wishes for success that I extend to you. It is also a pleasant duty for me to pay a most earnest and sincere tribute to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, who presided with such great talent and effectiveness over the fifty-second of the Assembly. Geography often dictates the fate of a nation. This is particularly true for the Principality of Monaco, whose life and development for centuries have depended on the sea. So it is that my country has always attached great importance to all issues concerning the sea. In fact, we host several institutions devoted to the marine environment. In this International Year of the Ocean, it seems fitting to recall that the Principality is also celebrating the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the birth of Prince 10 Albert I of Monaco, one of the founders of oceanography, to whom our country owes a great deal of its renown. My illustrious forebear, born in 1848, devoted a substantial part of his life to the scientific study of the oceans. An accomplished and passionate seaman, he was a pioneer during 30 years of scientific study that led him from the Azores to Spitzberg. Prince Albert I created in Monaco in 1910 the Oceanographic Museum in order to share what he had learned from his maritime expeditions and to reveal the beauty and wealth of the marine environment. Previously, in Paris in 1906, he had founded the Oceanographic Institute, which, in the same spirit, he devoted to teaching and research. He was also a forerunner of oceanology, in that some of his work or his insights led to major medical discoveries, such as anaphylaxis and antibacterial action. By advancing research on what he called the meteorology of the upper atmosphere of the oceans, he paved the way for studies of oceanic atmospheric exchanges and their impact on climate. Following his example, we should encourage climatological studies in order to prevent as much as possible such tragic flooding as that which — victimizing too many people — rages today in Bangladesh, in China and in the Chiapas region in Mexico. This is not to overlook, of course, hurricane Georges, which is now striking the Caribbean islands with such force. In responding to the wishes of the Ninth International Oceanographic Congress, on 30 March 1910 Prince Albert I brought together a special commission to propose a programme for the scientific exploration of the Mediterranean. Because of the First World War, the general constitutive conference could not be held until 1919, in Madrid. In the presence of representatives of eight States with coasts on the Mediterranean, the programme and working methods of the international commission for the scientific exploration of the Mediterranean were established. The comprehensive activities of this institution, unique in nature and mission, continue today. The institution brings together very high-level political leaders and scientists. Last June in Croatia it held its thirty-fifth meeting. Prince Rainier III, my father, who is now the Chairman, took that opportunity to again express his confidence in the scientific community, encouraging it not to underestimate the influence it might have on political decisions, especially in the area of maritime affairs. It is in this spirit that we attach special interest to the work conducted by the Independent World Commission on Oceans, under the leadership of the former President of Portugal, Mario Soares. We hope that its conclusions, which are essential for the lasting conservation of our marine heritage, will receive all the attention they deserve. Inspired by the scientific work of Prince Albert I, Prince Rainier III, my father, and his Government have in recent years continued and strengthened his visionary policy. Two examples are the scientific centre established in 1960 and the RAMOGE agreement signed with France and Italy so as to prevent all types of pollution — which are numerous in the Ligurian Sea. Furthermore, since last 27 March the Principality has had a law that brings together in one legislative body all provisions relating to the law of the sea, conforming them to the legal and technical requirements of the contemporary maritime world — first and foremost to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and other relevant international instruments to which Monaco is a party. We are also very much involved in activities carried out by the International Whaling Commission. Our efforts recently led to the establishment of 40 degrees south as the boundary of the new southern sanctuary designed to ensure protection for the feeding and reproduction grounds of 90 per cent of large whales. The Governments affected by this decision have committed themselves to limit the number of so-called scientific hunting permits in order to protect effectively this sanctuary. I would like, furthermore, to draw the attention of the General Assembly to fresh threats to the marine environment posed by new synthetic chemical products, such as dioxins and certain pesticides which affect the neurological and brain development of many species. Large amounts of these products are now found in the flesh of fish and other marine vertebrates in the northern hemisphere, presenting an imminent threat not only to the balance of marine biodiversity but also to the health of the human race. I am thinking in particular of the Beluga whales, now among the most poisoned animals on our planet. 11 The substantial contribution of Prince Albert I to progress in oceanography should not allow us to forget his research in other areas, such as the study of prehistory. Thanks to discoveries made in coastal caves, it has enabled us to identify one of the links in human evolution, which has helped to establish scientifically the common origin of the human race. These fossils, along with other archaeological objects found in the caves of the region, are preserved in the Museum of Prehistoric Anthropology, which the Prince created in 1902 in Monaco. Just as he had established the Oceanographic Institute in Paris to promote marine sciences, Prince Albert I gave the French capital an Institute of Human Paleontology, where since 1910 courses have been given and interdisciplinary research has been conducted on geology, prehistoric paleontology and ethnography. Like many scholars, Prince Albert I did not limit his activities to research. He felt the profound need for communication, teaching and propagation of knowledge. He gave talks in Italy, Belgium, Spain and Austria. He inaugurated congresses in Paris, Bordeaux and Washington. One could also see him in the outskirts of the French capital giving night classes to workers enrolled in the People?s University of Paris. Prince Albert I probably anticipated the immense enthusiasm with which at the beginning of the 1960s men and women of all disciplines and a large part of the peoples of the world were to come together in favour of ecology — that is, respect for nature, its balance and the interdependence of the beings that live in it. Since the beginning of the century he had perceived some of the bases for an environmentalism which was both popular and scientific and which he himself tried to put into practice. So it is that his temple of the sea, the Oceanographic Institute Museum of Monaco, was, on his initiative, surrounded by superb gardens containing original and varied Mediterranean species. Also very interested in botany, he established on the rocky, arid coast of Monaco an exotic garden open to the public where we find succulent plants, some very rare and endangered, preserved with great care. My ancestor was to some extent a forerunner of those involved in the defence of biodiversity. A profound believer in justice and an ardent defender of universal friendship, Prince Albert I in 1903 also created in Monaco the International Institute for Peace, where he brought together jurists, economists, philosophers and scientists to whom he assigned the mission of considering “ways of solving disputes between nations, propagating dedication to methods for bringing about harmonious understanding, and eradicating hatred from the hearts of peoples”. Forty-two years later these words echoed in the preamble to the United Nations Charter adopted in San Francisco. The Academy for Peace and International Security, which meets regularly in Monaco, perpetuates, on the initiative of my father, the reigning Prince, the determination of Prince Albert I to promote research on peace and the causes of conflict as well as the study of war. Its thirtieth session, which I was pleased to open on 19 March, devoted its work to globalization and international security. The discussions were led by high- ranking personalities from the worlds of diplomacy, defence and business, as well as by representatives of major international organizations. Its recommendations and conclusions essentially deal with the risks of tension and conflict inherent in the globalization of the economy and the best ways to overcome these risks. The interest in humankind expressed in his research on primitive man and his environment, his commitment to scientific knowledge and its spread, his rejection of violence and his tireless fight for peace and respect for nature are all very contemporary messages which Prince Albert I bequeathed to us. This was the meeting of a human life with history, and his multidimensional legacy has come to us through time. He has influenced the minds of the people of Monaco, generation upon generation, in making us a welcoming, peace-loving people, respectful of our environment. Enriched by and adapted to world developments and progress by his successors, primarily my father, this heritage is now at the core of essential missions which we have entrusted to the United Nations. My country, within its modest means, is more prepared than ever to make its experience, inherited from its difficult past, available for understanding and rapprochement. The defence of human rights and respect for human dignity, which are inscribed in letters of gold in the United Nations Charter, were no doubt of inspiration to Prince Albert I when he personally committed himself to the rehabilitation of Captain Dreyfus and when he decided to grant constitutional political rights to his subjects in 1911. These fundamental human rights are being commemorated by the international community today. This is a great event. Fifty years ago, on 10 December 1948, our General Assembly at its third session, held in Paris at the Palais de Chaillot, adopted the Universal 12 Declaration of Human Rights. One of those primarily responsible for it, the French professor René Cassin, received in 1968, 20 years after the solemn proclamation, the Nobel Peace Prize. This commemoration should be an opportunity for collective soul-searching. To what extent are human rights enjoyed internationally? Above all, what is the position with regard to the initiatives taken to realize the right to development, which was officially recognized in 1993 by the international community at the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna? The current fierce economic competition which is aggravating macroeconomic imbalances is not without an impact on the enjoyment of human rights. While respect for civil and political rights seems to be less affected, economic, social and cultural rights underpinning the right to development have made only modest progress — where they have not, indeed, met with major setbacks. The current financial crisis is depriving millions of men and women of their basic rights, when not actually destroying their lives. At the world level, it has led to an overall drop in life expectancy, an increase in infant and maternal mortality, greater unemployment, growing insecurity, uncontrolled migration and a grave deterioration in social welfare, accompanied by a relentless drop in income among the active population. The high-level dialogue on the theme of the social and economic impact of globalization and interdependence and their policy implications, which was held in this Hall on 17 and 18 September, clearly stressed these facts. Human rights are indissoluble. They must be enjoyed by everyone everywhere. As the General Assembly proclaimed on 10 December 1948, they are a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations. The highest authorities of my country, along with the entire Monegasque people, are thoroughly convinced of this. One thought comes to mind. It may be a lengthy one, since the question is delicate and quite complex. The Government of the Principality is perfectly well aware that urgent and concrete steps must be encouraged at the national and global levels. Mrs. Mary Robinson, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, has our full support and all our confidence. We know how difficult her task is and how pitiful are her resources in the face of reality. The Principality of Monaco also attaches the highest importance to the tireless and courageous work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which, I am pleased to recall, received the Nobel Peace Prize nearly 45 years ago in 1954. Mrs. Sadako Ogata and her colleagues deserve our support and respect. The United Nations humanitarian activities, which are necessary today as never before, and its efforts to eliminate anti-personnel landmines and the human tragedy they entail also deserve our greatest encouragement. I wish here to emphasize the special interest which my father, the Sovereign Prince, and I, President of the Red Cross of Monaco — currently celebrating its fiftieth anniversary — attach to respect for and strict implementation of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949. Despite the tireless efforts of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, as well as of many humanitarian organizations that I wish to commend here for the altruism and courage of their members, we note an increase in serious violations of this text, as well as of the most basic human rights of the most vulnerable sectors of the population, including children. Last June, the Security Council rightly expressed its grave concern at the terrible consequences to children of armed conflict. It energetically and unequivocally condemned the abuses to which they are subject, especially the humiliations, outrages, sexual violence, kidnapping and displacements, as well their recruitment and use in combat, in violation of current international law. The authorities of Monaco unreservedly share that position and are prepared to lend active support, to the extent of their abilities, to the Secretary-General?s Special Representative for Children in Armed Conflict so that he may fulfil his noble mission. Unfortunately, the fate of children may be equally tragic outside armed conflict. Following the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, held in Stockholm in August 1996, the Government of Monaco, as I stated to the General Assembly at its fifty-first session, has striven to reform its criminal legislation in order to bring it into line with its commitments. In implementation of article 34 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Monaco is Party, new legislative provisions have been enacted, with broader scope to criminalize to the greatest possible extent the sexual exploitation of children to satisfy the vices of others. The establishment, last July in Rome, of an International Criminal Court is a source of great hope. 13 This represents major progress, a far-reaching change in the international order that fosters respect for the essential principles of humanitarian law. Its Statute, adopted by a large majority, opens the way to the prosecution of war crimes and the most heinous crimes against humanity, many of which affect children, of course, but also woman and the defenceless elderly. The Principality of Monaco, which participated in the Diplomatic Conference in Rome, welcomes this historic decision. The Royal Government is grateful that such weighty issues as the definition of crimes, the principle of complementarity, jurisdictions, the independence of the prosecutor?s office and relations with United Nations organs were all solved satisfactorily. I also wish to express on behalf of my country our great satisfaction at the work which the Secretary-General has done in recent months. The reports he submits to us note progress in many areas, including administrative and financial management and the restructuring of the Secretariat. Outstanding progress has been achieved thanks to the trusting and close cooperation he has established with representatives of Member States and with officials of the most influential international world and regional bodies. His diplomatic initiatives, carried out with great wisdom, patience and determination, have often been crowned with success, despite the obstacles and difficulties he has encountered. We are especially pleased that, in come cases, his initiatives have allowed us to prevent or stabilize conflicts that might otherwise have been extremely devastating. The Secretary-General?s well-written and incisive report on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa has riveted our attention. It is a valuable source of inspiration and ideas for bringing peace to Africa. In this respect, I cannot fail to recall that we are commemorating this year the fiftieth anniversary of peacekeeping operations. It was in 1948 that the first United Nations observer mission was established. I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to all those men and women who have served under the United Nations flag and to salute the memory of those who gave their lives in the line of duty. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld was among them. More recently, in Kabul, an Italian Lieutenant Colonel was killed and a French military adviser wounded. The Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, adopted by the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session, is more relevant than ever. Ten years ago, on 10 December 1988, United Nations Peacekeeping Forces received the Nobel Peace Prize. As I see it, this high distinction should be recalled on the occasion of this anniversary. I would like to express great sadness felt in my country over the accident of Swissair flight 111. My saddest thoughts go to the victims of that accident, some of whom belonged to the great United Nations family. We share the grief of their loved ones. Africa and Europe have recently experienced a tragic series of terrorist attacks that have taken a toll of hundreds of victims including women, children, elderly people, many of whom were present merely by chance. Those attacks have given rise to an inevitable escalation of the use of force and an increased risk of conflict. The authorities and people of Monaco have felt these painful events very deeply. Through me, they wish to reaffirm to the Governments concerned and to the families of the victims their solidarity and their deepest sympathy. On 13 August 1995, the Security Council firmly condemned acts of terrorism, which they called an outrage. It recalled its statement of 31 January 1992, issued at its high-level meeting of heads of State and Government. The Principality of Monaco agrees fully with that position. It is perfectly aware that terrorism endangers not only the security of States and their citizens, but also international cooperation and peace. My country is more convinced than ever of the need to strengthen international cooperation, with a view to combating more effectively this scourge, which is a serious and tragic setback in relations among human beings, nations and peoples. It fully endorses the provisions of General Assembly resolution 52/165, adopted on 15 December 1997, and its provisions aimed at the elimination of international terrorism. Our Government is now considering the possibility of adhering to the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, which was adopted last year without a vote and which is currently open for signature. Furthermore, we hope that negotiations under way on a draft convention on the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism will be concluded quickly. In conclusion, it is my hope that the work of this fifty-third session of the General Assembly will be crowned with success and that the activities of the 14 Organization will be strengthened in such vital areas as international security, disarmament, sustainable development and the protection of the environment.  I wish to recall the late B.P. Koirala, the legendary leader who became the symbol of democracy in Nepal because of his long years of imprisonment, self-sacrifice and struggle. As the first elected Prime Minister of Nepal, he stood at this podium 38 years ago to this very day and declared that the foreign policy of Nepal would be inspired by the purposes and principles of the United Nations. He said that Nepal looked upon the United Nations as an instrument for promoting peace and justice among nations. Those sentiments have always guided Nepal?s international relations. It is my pleasure to extend to you, Sir, the warm congratulations of my delegation on your election as President of the General Assembly. It is a tribute to your great country?s contribution to the work of the United Nations and a recognition of your own personal qualifications. Please be assured of the cooperation of my delegation in your work. I would also like to place on record our appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Udovenko, for the wisdom and deftness of touch with which he guided the previous session. I would also like to express, on behalf of the Government and the people of Nepal, our deep sympathy and condolences to the Governments and the peoples of Bangladesh and China on the massive loss of life and property due to the recent devastating floods in those two friendly neighbouring countries. We also sympathize with the victims of hurricane Georges. It is heartening to note that this year we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. While we are guided by lofty human rights goals in the international field, we are no less committed to attaining them at the national level. Our commitment to democracy, human rights and uplifting the quality of life of the people is unflinching, despite a low level of economic development and the innumerable constraints, including the problem of refugees. It is our firm belief that democracy and 4 development should reinforce each other. Society can enjoy uninterrupted peace and progress only when the rule of law and the participation of an entire people in governance and development are ensured. We are a small nation with a great heritage. Our tradition has been one of peace, compassion and brotherhood. We have always striven to promote understanding and goodwill among different nations, especially with our neighbours. While retaining our age-old cultural values, our people have struggled for years and have made great sacrifices to establish democratic institutions and to uphold the principles of human rights and dignity. In this endeavour we are conscious of the challenges that we have to face. But we are determined to make all possible efforts to fulfil the aspirations of our people and, in our limited way, to contribute to the achievement of the noble ideals of this great Organization, which provides us with a forum to express our views on the concerns of mankind. I consider it a privilege and an opportunity to make an appeal to the developed nations to extend support and cooperation in our endeavour to preserve the dignity and honour of our people and the sovereignty of our nation. We are determined to face every eventuality to defend those ideals. Centralized planning has failed to produce desired results even after many years. We believe that unless people are mobilized, from the grass roots to the policy level, the reality on the ground is unlikely to change. To realize this, institutional and legal changes are necessary. Administrative, financial and political systems have all to be decentralized. Real power has to be transferred to the people. We have taken certain steps in that direction. However, I admit that this is not enough. We are committed to the empowerment of women. But changing gender hierarchies without changing social and economic hierarchies is not possible, as gender relations do not operate in a vacuum. It is a fact that gender relations are related to and influenced by social, economic and political systems. Nevertheless, as a prelude to the political empowerment of Nepali women, 20 per cent of the seats in local bodies have been reserved. As a result, 36,000 women are now in the political hierarchy at the grass-roots level. In my opinion, this is a significant breakthrough. The list of problems facing us is endless. We live today in an unequal world, where global disparities in wealth and income are rising rapidly, widening the gap between the rich and the poor, increasingly dividing human societies into one of plenty, luxury and power, on the one hand, and one of poverty and hardship, on the other. The low level of economic development due to the lack of capital and technology, among other things, is hampering the progress and prosperity of developing countries. Similarly, the falling prices of primary commodities, the lack of access to international markets and the low level of resource flows and the unfavourable international economic environment have compounded the difficulties of the developing countries. The worldwide wave of liberalism in trade and services in the aftermath of World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements has moved the international economy to greater competitiveness. However, the capacity of the developing countries to trade needs to be sufficiently enhanced to ensure a level playing field. The current financial and economic crisis facing many countries is affecting even the advanced economies of the world, not to mention the vulnerable and weaker ones. This calls for much-needed reforms in the global financial system. The developing world consists of 85 per cent of humanity, more than one third of them in the least developed countries. One third of the countries in this most vulnerable category are landlocked, and this structural deficiency is the greatest handicap to fair competition and development. All these countries have a vital stake in peace and development. In the shaping of a new global dispensation, each category of nations should have a voice and should receive fair and equal treatment. Sustainable development is not only an economic or ecological phenomenon; it also involves participatory governance, empowerment of women and promotion of equity and justice. In a developing country such as Nepal, the role and participation of women in the development process are of great significance because of the multiple responsibilities of women. In this context, the role of the United Nations system in enhancing the participation of women in national development and in creating awareness of the issues relating to women is laudable. On our march towards a democratic and just society, we face many challenges, such as pervasive poverty, mass illiteracy, environmental degradation, population explosion and, above all, gender inequality. We believe that many problems related to economic development can be more effectively tackled through regional and subregional cooperation among nations. Tremendous opportunities are 5 available for subregional cooperation in our part of the world among the countries in the Ganga-Brahmaputra- Meghna basin. These opportunities include water resources development, flood control, energy supply, forestry management and environmental protection, among other things. Development efforts in water resources, for example, would help irrigate the fertile fields in the plains of India, improve the waterways so vital for the transportation sector of Bangladesh and generate hydropower in Nepal to meet the energy needs of the region as a whole. Such a development strategy may be the key to the future prosperity of the region. Nearly a quarter of the world?s population continues to live in extreme poverty. This is largely because our approach to development, in which the State plays an overwhelming role, has given rise to inefficiency and corruption, and our reliance on unregulated market forces has led to an increase in inequality across the world. We believe there is a need for a third alternative in which the human being is at the centre, not the State or market forces; the human being with faith, values, emotions; the human being with dreams and aspirations as a citizen, as a member of family and as an economic being. This approach takes into account all the dimensions of the human being and society. Changing economic relationships and structure alone is not enough. The individual also has to change. We believe that this is what we should be pursuing in the twenty-first century. I bring the greetings and good wishes of the Government and the people of Nepal to the Secretary- General, Mr. Kofi Annan. In a comparatively short period of time, he has proved his dedication to the task of modernizing our Organization and his great diplomatic talent and statesmanship in defusing situations posing a real threat to international peace and security. In the process of reform which he has started with his far-reaching package of proposals, he can count on Nepal?s support. Reform by its very nature is a continuing process. The United Nations and its principal organs, such as the Security Council, must adapt to the dynamics of change. However, we, the Member States, have so far failed to arrive at a general agreement to improve the composition and functioning of the Security Council to better reflect the reality of a vastly expanded membership of the Organization. The recently concluded summit of the Non- Aligned Movement in South Africa reaffirmed the collective position of non-aligned countries in this regard. No scheme of reform, however, should undermine the power and authority of the General Assembly, which is the nearest thing to a world parliament. All the leaders of Nepal who have addressed the Assembly have underscored the role and authority of this most democratic and representative organ where each of us has a voice and vote equal to that of a great Power, on any questions or any matters within the scope of the Charter of the Organization. Sound and secure financing is the basis for good management of the Organization. We believe that all Member States must fulfil their obligations to make full and timely payment of their dues. In its primary role in the maintenance of international peace and security, peacekeeping has been and will remain one of the indispensable tools of the United Nations. As a troop-contributing country, we are happy to commemorate 50 years of United Nations peacekeeping. Over these years, Nepal has contributed more than 32,000 troops and military and civilian police monitors to various peacekeeping missions of the United Nations around the globe. Many of them have lost lives or limbs in the cause of peace. Nepal has signed a stand- by system agreement with the United Nations. We are committed to deploying up to 2,000 troops, including medical and engineering units, military observers and headquarters staff, and 200 police monitors available to be called at any time by the United Nations, even on short notice. The recent nuclear tests in South Asia, which came as a disturbing development, have nevertheless reinforced our commitment to speeding up the time-bound nuclear disarmament process. We welcome the declarations made by the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan in this Hall last week to facilitate the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. My delegation is happy to note that the Secretary- General has recognized that the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, known as the Kathmandu Centre, has provided a valuable forum for meetings on regional confidence and security-building measures. As host to the Centre, Nepal would urge Member States of the Asia-Pacific region to increasingly avail themselves of the services of the Centre. Problems related to drug abuse and terrorism defy territorial barriers. As the Prime Minister of Nepal, 6 Mr. Girija Prasad Koirala, stated at the Durban summit at the beginning of this month, they add to the intricacies of complex regional and global relations. The terrorist bombings in Kenya and Tanzania deserve universal condemnation. These bombings and the subsequent missile strikes came as a shock, reinforcing our belief that concerted international efforts are essential in this regard. Let me conclude by briefly mentioning the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), consisting of seven countries of the region representing one fifth of humanity. We are united in a common effort to improve the quality of life of all our peoples. The recent Colombo summit agreed to draw up a SAARC social charter to give further dimension to regional cooperation. The seven SAARC countries also finalized a text of a regional convention on combatting the crime of trafficking in women and children for prostitution. The convention will be signed in Kathmandu at the next SAARC summit. This will be another landmark in regional cooperation in South Asia. I would first like to congratulate our colleague, the Uruguayan Minister Didier Opertti, on his election to the presidency of our General Assembly. I would also like to associate myself with the statement made by our colleague, Mr. Wolfgang SchÃ¼ssel, who spoke on behalf of the European Union. My country shares and supports entirely the concerns and objectives he outlined. Unprecedented crises over the last few months have shaken our economies and the economies of the entire region. To varying degrees, the economies of the world have all sustained the social and political consequences of interdependence and the information systems that link them. It therefore seems to me that the time has come to rethink seriously the way in which international institutions and national Governments deal with the tensions and constraints which result from globalization. This means specifically that we must reflect upon the quality of life humankind will have in the next century. Despite worrisome forecasts, we seem unable to come up with a list of priorities which reflects the global public interest. We must establish a common frame of reference that ensures the peaceful coexistence of States and their citizens while at the same time respecting their diversity. This task is the indispensable corollary of globalization, which has numerous ramifications for current problems. The international communityâs responses have therefore been flawed and partial and subject to corporate logic and a narrow view of the issues. The limitations of these responses are well known to us. Countless children died last year from diseases which could have been eradicated. Tropical forests covering an area equivalent to three times the size of Belgium 21 disappeared. The developing worldâs debt remains untenably large, while expenditures for weapons continues to grow. Incalculable numbers of people have been detained, tortured, killed or forced to flee their countries. Hundreds of innocent victims have lost their lives in terrorist attacks. Global information networks and new technologies reduce distances. Thanks to television, more than one billion people can today discover both manâs incredible inventions and the worst abuses he is capable of. This is a scenario which touches our conscience. Todayâs crises affect the entire global system and call for solutions on the same level. The only way to respond effectively is to give a greater role to international solidarity and social justice. Those are the two pillars of the new international ethic that I would like to call for today. This is not a simple task. No Government likes to limit its room to manoeuvre, even for just causes, if it is the only one paying the price for its commitments. I am nevertheless convinced that the United Nations is the best forum to have a debate on this matter of international public interest. It is here, and nowhere else, that we can draw up universally accepted norms that have the approval of the largest possible number of States. The Organization can help us strengthen international consensus and the acceptance of codes of conduct designed to set the boundaries of human dignity and peaceful coexistence. Economic and financial power dominates the world, but the last few months have shown that it is not capable of running it. The globalization of political life and civil society leads us to attempt to reach beyond national limitations to confront our problems. Liberalization has generated significant growth in trade and investments. It has also led to increased transparency between our different social systems. This transparency obliges us more than in the past to reflect upon our concepts of the rights of the individual and the need to defend them. However, access to the global economic village has not led to a concomitant strengthening of solidarity. The capacity of men and women to adapt has been severely put to the test. The grip of the logic of the marketplace on the individual seems to relegate him to a secondary role in the international system. Our societies should henceforth reconcile the often very divergent effects that globalization has on the individual and on the State â€” namely, unemployment, competition and financial speculation. The balance between the freedom of some and the rights of others is all too often disturbed. Marginalization and abject poverty are reappearing, thereby threatening the exercise of the most fundamental of rights. After the 1980s â€” a lost decade, from the point of view of development â€” the decade of structural adjustments has been unable to put economies back on the road to sustainable development. Differences in income, both at the level of society and at the global level, have been accentuated. What can we do? What must we do? The Internet and the financial markets by themselves cannot hold the international community together. We know that Governments alone are incapable of dealing with the problems with which they are confronted. This is why new forms of solidarity and new ways of dealing with these issues are indispensable. Only a strong political international organization can counterbalance the forces of the financial markets. The loss of power of nation-States over financial and economic decisions is glaring; the social consequences are even more so. This does not call into question the existing consensus on the validity of controlled liberalization of trade, but it does put all Governments up against the wall. Has the time not come for some sort of regulation that benefits everyone? Indeed, liberalization cannot be an end in itself. It has no purpose if it does not contribute to social progress for the largest possible number of people. We should therefore strive together to find concerted responses to the uncontrolled and painful effects of this evolution by strengthening public control throughout the world. In this regard some have proposed an economic security council. This is obviously an ambitious idea, but it does serve to show how serious the threat of financial instability and economic uncertainty is to our societies. In any case, an intensified dialogue between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions must be instituted as a first step. Of course, regional strategies have been developed to strengthen economic convergence in certain regions and to integrate them into zones. Nevertheless, these regional strategies should respect the rules of multilateralism. Efficient partnerships based on mutual trade have to be developed with other regions without marginalizing third States. Developing countries must be integrated in commerce and enjoy the fruits of market liberalization. In this respect, my country supports the efforts placed on record by the European Union in the spirit referred to as â€œfair tradeâ€. 22 I would now like to say a few words about the United Nations, which is at the centre of all these interactions. I say to you, the representatives of the 185 nations committed to the pursuit of the objectives of the United Nations, that we have all too often forgotten our obligations under the Charter. Now that we are free of the shackles of the cold war and its ideological deadlocks, the obligation to strengthen cohesion between States and to promote social justice is more than ever the real order of business. In this respect, I support the proposal to devote the Millennium Assembly to the issue of the fight against poverty. The gaze of much of the world will be turned towards the United Nations at that time. It would be a terrible failure if on that occasion we were only able to refer poverty to various committees, soothing our conscience with meetings of fleeting significance. As the Secretary-General stresses in his report, the fight against poverty starts with good governance. Political democratization and mechanisms for revenue sharing are indispensable elements. The question of Central Africa is currently of particular importance for Africa. After hopes were raised for what some wanted to call an African renaissance, the continent has again become prey to violence that is becoming dangerously ethnic in character. Once again, the principal victims are among the most vulnerable people in the world. The crisis in the Great Lakes region is a moral challenge for the United Nations. It imposes on us the duty of solidarity. We must help Africa to find solutions and to implement them without interfering or trying to impose solutions. The United Nations, together with the relevant regional and subregional organizations, should involve itself in an initiative to restore dialogue to the region and to put confidence-building measures in place. I believe that a conference on regional security and cooperation in the Great Lakes region â€” if it is viewed as a process rather than as a single event â€” could serve as the vehicle for stabilizing the region. My country is willing to support such an initiative. Political instability, uninterrupted violence and challenges to the nation State have led to large-scale population movements. In Central Africa, Kosovo and elsewhere, hundreds of thousands of families have been forced to flee their homes and their land. It is our shared duty to continue to assist humanitarian organizations in their efforts to come to the aid of these refugees and to enable them to return home. However, sometimes, when the roads or the family land are littered with landmines and children cannot go to school without being exposed to physical danger, returning can be a problem. We must rid ourselves of these landmines; their production must stop. These devices of death must be for ever banished from the Earth. I welcome the entry into force of the Convention on the total prohibition of anti-personnel landmines and appeal to donor and victim countries to support the integrated activities undertaken by the United Nations in this field, including through voluntary financial contributions. But that is not enough. Conflict prevention should be a priority, and within our Organization we must also pay attention to the less spectacular aspects of conflict prevention, such as early warning and the establishment of an appropriate United Nations presence on the ground. Conflict prevention will make no sense if we do not at the same time put an end to the acquisition of arms by those who attempt to resolve their problems through violence. Belgium has responded positively to the European Union initiative to formulate a code of conduct for arms transactions. My country is also a strong advocate of giving the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms effective universal application. It is also behind several initiatives designed to block the illegal transfer of small arms. The Brussels conference, which will take place in October, and our participation on the Panel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms, provide further examples of our commitment, which extends to all sectors of disarmament. How could it be otherwise, when some countries consider it useful to put on an alarming show of their nuclear expertise? A significant contribution to ethical renewal in international relations was the adoption, after much work, of the Statute of the International Criminal Court. It is indeed shocking that those responsible for the most reprehensible crimes, in particular genocide, can go unpunished. Belgium has recently signed the Statute of the International Criminal Court and intends to work for its effective establishment. My country will also continue to support the two existing United Nations ad hoc criminal tribunals. Some countries still harbour doubts about that important undertaking. However, a balance has been found between international security and justice. The only remaining question is whether we, so-called civilized nations, are prepared to adopt binding rules so as to ensure respect for the most elementary and universally 23 accepted principles of respect for the human being and international coexistence. Adopting voluntary restrictions to strengthen an international ethical code can only benefit States and their citizens. That is truly the role of the State: to ensure that its citizens are protected â€” if necessary, through international law. I do not consider it realistic to develop a global ethical code without working for the protection and education of our children. Working together with other countries, the United Nations Childrenâs Fund (UNICEF) and other United Nations organizations, Belgium has played an important role in a number of initiatives. I propose that the General Assembly at its fifty-third session build upon its achievements with respect to the definition of standards for the protection of children. Child labour is a waste of human beings â€” for the girls and boys who are subjected to it and for future generations. Market forces must yield in this area. Like the enlistment of child soldiers, child labour is a moral scandal that must be remedied through the development of alternatives adapted to the sociocultural context at the local level. One of my Governmentâs priorities is the fight against the most repugnant forms of exploitation. We are alarmed by the use of the Internet by those who traffic in children and by networks of prostitutes and all the new forms of crime that make a mockery of traditional methods of defending the rule of law. Here, too, international cooperation is the only solution. I am also ready to take the initiative, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the Convention of the Rights of the Child in 1999, to organize, together with UNICEF and all interested countries, a meeting in Belgium at which we can all share our experiences with regard to our respective legislation. The ideas that I have outlined will be not bear fruit if Member States do not cooperate fully with the Organization. Denying the Secretary-General the resources needed to turn the United Nations into an efficient instrument will only make matters worse. The Secretary- General deserves our full support in his reform efforts. The Security Council is crucial for the maintenance of international peace and security. Its reform is of concern to us all. I hope that in the not-too-distant future, a balanced enlargement of the Council can be agreed upon. The work undertaken during the past year has sometimes been disappointing because of the stubborn resistance of several countries. Belgium belongs to the majority of Member States arguing for a strengthening of the authority of the Council. My country clearly laid out its position: we would like an equal increase in the number of permanent and non-permanent members, better representation of the various regions and self-imposed limits on the use of the right of veto under certain conditions provided for in advance. The privilege of veto is excessive when it is used to the detriment of the interests of the international community as whole. The consensus proposal put forward by the group of 10 has numerous advantages and offers material for further reflection. It is quite disturbing to see that a minority of Member States are ignoring the evolution of international relations over the last 50 years while at the same time claiming for themselves a preponderant role in the maintenance of international peace and security. Postponing reform of the Security Council is tantamount to an assault on its credibility. The financial health of the Organization has not improved much over the course of the last year. Belgium believes that countries that accumulate arrears harm the entire international community. The damage goes beyond the resulting debt, because the Organization is denied the means fully to discharge its mandate. Furthermore, the reform process is jeopardized. Nothing can make up for the damage this does to international cooperation and social progress. The political and moral responsibility of those Governments is at stake. None who speak from this rostrum can claim their attachment to United Nations ideals without accepting the financial obligations involved in being a Member, that is, payment in full, on time and without conditions of their financial contributions. In face of the excesses of the international system, the international community must be on guard. Here as well our Organization can be the worldâs conscience. Its weighty role is to help Member States formulate adequate responses to the globalization with which we are confronted. It is therefore in a serious yet hopeful frame of mind that I look at the agenda of this session of the General Assembly and pledge my countryâs full support for the work ahead of us. On behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Korea, I sincerely congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti on his election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. We are fully confident that the Assembly will reap fruitful results under his distinguished leadership. I would also like to pay tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko, and to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan. I would like to discuss today our common future and the various efforts that we will need to consider to ensure its betterment. With the new millennium just around the corner, we must contemplate the possibilities for our future world. With confidence and pride, we can look back over the past five decades and note with appreciation the tremendous contributions the United Nations has made towards international peace and prosperity. We must also note that today the United Nations is confronted with enormous challenges and opportunities. The identification of these challenges, both within the United Nations itself and in the world with which the United Nations must engage, is where our discussion must begin. As a world community, we face trends and challenges that test our wisdom and courage. Before I discuss our common efforts, I would like to begin by addressing how we are now handling our own concerns in Korea. Last February, the Republic of Korea inaugurated the Government of President Kim Dae-jung. This Government carries special significance for the Korean people because it marks the first time an opposition party has acceded to power in the 50-year constitutional history of Korea. The Republic of Korea is one of the countries that gained independence during the last half-century; it has subsequently developed into a liberal democracy within a relatively short period of time. Poverty-stricken and war- torn only 50 years ago, the Republic of Korea has now grown to be a middle-power State. My country is currently endeavouring to overcome enormous economic difficulties and to ensure the parallel and harmonious development of democracy and free market economy. We are well aware that the world is watching to see if and how we can accomplish such a difficult task. On 15 August 1998, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Government of the Republic of Korea, President Kim Dae Jung proclaimed the launching of our “Second Nation Building” to define the nation?s efforts to overcome the current crisis and to foster Korea?s democracy and market economy to greater maturity. Our immediate concerns, however, are not only economic. The new Government of the Republic of Korea formulated the “Sunshine Policy”, a policy of constructive engagement, as the cornerstone of its stance towards North Korea. Division, war and confrontation have more often than not characterized inter-Korean relations. Changing the nature of this relationship requires the restoration and cultivation of mutual trust between the two parties. To achieve these goals, President Kim announced the following three principles immediately after his inauguration: no tolerance of any military provocation by North Korea; no attempts on our part to absorb the North; and the active promotion of inter- Korean reconciliation, exchange and cooperation. In line with these principles, my Government is encouraging private sector initiatives to pursue exchanges and cooperation with the North at their own discretion, while maintaining the principle of reciprocity at the governmental level. The Republic of Korea will remain committed to actively responding to the appeals of the United Nations and other international organizations to assist North Korea to overcome its food shortages and economic difficulties. We believe that inter-Korean consultations are indispensable for North Korea?s economic recovery. In this regard, we also look forward to the role of the United Nations system as a facilitator of this process. In his August speech, President Kim Dae Jung further proposed the establishment of a permanent inter- Korean dialogue arrangement headed by ministerial or vice-ministerial officials, in the hope of opening a new 11 era of reconciliation and cooperation between the two Koreas. He also made it clear that the Republic of Korea is willing to send an envoy to Pyongyang to discuss this proposal. The main thrust of President Kim?s engagement policy is to establish a workable system of peaceful coexistence based on reconciliation and mutual trust. The Democratic People?s Republic of Korea reacted passively or even negatively to these proposals. It provoked the Republic of Korea by infiltrating a submarine into South Korean territorial waters in June, and again in late August by launching a rocket into the western Pacific Ocean without any prior warning. My Government deplores these acts of provocation. They pose a serious threat to our security. But despite these acts of provocation, my Government continues to uphold the keynote of its engagement policy so that the two Koreas might come to enjoy the benefits of peaceful coexistence. My Government hopes that the leadership of the Democratic People?s Republic of Korea will put aside its defiance and respond positively to our calls for dialogue and collaboration. We would like to revitalize and implement the Inter-Korean Basic Agreement of 1992 through South-North dialogue. My Government will try to ease tension and create a peaceful environment on the Korean Peninsula through the four-party talks process. I wish to reiterate that our immediate objective is, first and foremost, peaceful coexistence. We hope that the Democratic People?s Republic of Korea will respond with an equal display of sincerity and good faith to our policies of accommodation. I would now like to share some thoughts with you on the current global economic situation. In the past decade, we have witnessed deepening interdependence among countries in the accelerated, market-driven process of globalization. However, contrary to earlier expectations that the globalization process would stimulate world economic growth and reduce the gap between developed and developing countries, the international community is now baffled by the negative repercussions of rapid globalization. Asian countries, which have long been a model of economic development, are now struggling with serious financial crises. Other countries are also suffering economic unrest, and together these may lead to global economic turmoil. The international community, amid sudden and unexpected economic turbulences, would be well advised to develop a common strategy to maximize potential economic benefits of market liberalization and globalization. Towards this end, my Government welcomes the United Nations initiative to strengthen its dialogue and cooperation with the Bretton Woods system. The United Nations is expected to play a more active role in addressing diverse problems arising from the globalization process. Among the various factors that triggered our own domestic economic difficulties was a loose application of the rule of accountability in the corporate and financial sector. My Government is trying to turn the current financial crisis into an opportunity to reform and revitalize its economy. We are taking bold and decisive steps towards a comprehensive structural reform based on democracy and market principles. This structural reform is intended to ensure deregulation of economic activities, transparency and accountability in the financial and corporate sector, and mobility in the labour market. When the ongoing structural reform is successfully completed, the Republic of Korea will be a more free and more open society, contributing to the resurgence of economic dynamism in the Asian region. This is the goal of our structural reform. In spite of overall growth in the world economy, the least developed countries continue to be marginalized and still do not receive their fair share of the benefits of that general trend. As a community, we should pay more attention to the deteriorating situation in these marginalized countries and should strengthen economic and development cooperation for their sustainable growth. For this purpose, my Government supports the development of the least developed countries through the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and cooperates with United Nations regional economic commissions, such as the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA). Even with the current financial crisis, the Republic of Korea continues to play its due role in development cooperation, with KOICA as its focal point. While contributing to the strengthening of multilateral cooperation, we are also participating in regional cooperation efforts aimed at stimulating and sustaining steady regional growth and balanced development for the Asia-Pacific region. We are contributing to regional liberalization of trade and investment through active involvement in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC). In addition, my Government is scheduled to host the third summit of the Asia-Europe Meeting in the year 2000. We will do our 12 best to make the summit a milestone in building a comprehensive partnership between Asia and Europe. Beyond these immediate concerns for economic revitalization in Korea and the world community in general, we are faced with another long-term challenge, that of environmental protection. Climate changes, for instance, demand urgent attention and concrete actions by all countries. Last year, we made historic progress in combating global warming by adopting the Kyoto Protocol. I am pleased to say that my Government will accede to the Kyoto Protocol this afternoon. I should like to take this opportunity to say a few words about the International Vaccine Institute (IVI). My Government has hosted IVI as a part of its commitment to international efforts to prevent childhood diseases, especially those in developing countries. Thirty-two Governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) have signed the Establishment Agreement of IVI, aimed at developing and distributing non-commercial vaccines. Yesterday in New York, the Government of the Republic of Korea and IVI signed the Headquarters Agreement. I look forward to more active support and to the substantial participation of Member States in this worthy project. Fifty years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and despite strenuous efforts by the United Nations and human rights defenders, we are still witnessing, to our dismay, serious human rights violations and blatant challenges to United Nations human rights mechanisms throughout the world. Notwithstanding these grim realities, I am convinced that history is moving towards universal respect for human rights and dignity. In this context, my Government fully supports the Secretary- General?s initiative to mainstream human rights in all of the United Nations activities and programmes. As an initiative to bolster national human rights safeguard mechanisms, my Government has begun preparations for enacting a comprehensive human rights act and establishing a national human rights institution. My Government welcomes the adoption of the Statute of the International Criminal Court in Rome last July. We are confident that the establishment of the Court will be a landmark in strengthening the international legal system. We earnestly hope that the Court will be launched as soon as possible. In the rapidly changing international security environment of the post-cold-war era, the United Nations is now faced with new challenges arising from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. We deeply regret the recent nuclear tests carried out by India and then Pakistan. These tests seriously undermine the nuclear non-proliferation regime. We call upon the States concerned to desist from further nuclear testing and weaponization, and to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) without delay. We also urge the international community to maintain vigilance to prevent the transfer of their nuclear weapons-related materials, equipment and technology to third countries. In this context, we believe that the early entry into force and the securing of the universality of the CTBT should be a high priority of the disarmament agenda. My Government is proceeding with its domestic procedures for the ratification of the CTBT next year. At the same time, we welcome the decision made at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva last month to establish an ad hoc committee on the Fissile Material Cut-off Convention. We also call upon all nuclear-weapon States faithfully to comply with their obligations to undertake nuclear disarmament pursuant to article VI of the NPT. We stress once again that the Democratic People?s Republic of Korea, as a State party to the NPT, should fully comply with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards agreement. It should also carry out its obligations to freeze its nuclear activities and eventually dismantle the related facilities in accordance with the Geneva Agreed Framework. In particular, it should cooperate closely with the IAEA in preserving necessary information related to its past nuclear activities. Furthermore, we urge the Democratic People?s Republic of Korea to demonstrate its sincerity in upholding the Agreed Framework by guaranteeing full transparency with regard to the recently discovered underground facilities near Yongbyon. For its part, my Government will make continued efforts, together with the United States, Japan and other parties concerned, for smooth progress in the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) project, pursuant to the Agreed Framework. As the KEDO project contributes to the peace and security of the region, we look forward to continued political and financial support from the international community. We also believe that both Koreas should renew their efforts to implement the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula of 1992. 13 My Government shares the grave concern of the international community over the launching of the rocket- propelled object by the Democratic People?s Republic of Korea on 31 August. The Democratic People?s Republic of Korea?s ability to develop delivery means of weapons of mass destruction poses a serious threat to peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in North-East Asia. The international community should make concerted efforts to induce the Democratic People?s Republic of Korea to refrain from conducting further missile development, testing and exporting. Chemical and biological weapons are another category of weapons of mass destruction that requires our serious attention. We commend the valuable achievements of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons over the last year and a half. Regrettably, a number of countries presumed to possess chemical weapons, including the Democratic People?s Republic of Korea, have not yet acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention. We urge those States to do so without delay. My delegation also hopes for an early adoption of the Verification Protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention. In recent years, we have seen the United Nations peacekeeping operations expand their activities to such areas as repatriation of refugees, demilitarization and disbanding of armies, and the policing and monitoring of elections. While this trend can be viewed positively, my delegation is deeply concerned about the increasing number of victims among civilian volunteers and United Nations personnel. The Republic of Korea, while serving as a member of the Security Council last year, initiated a Council open debate on protection for humanitarian assistance to refugees in conflict situations, which led to the adoption of a presidential statement. We hope that the Secretary-General?s report on this topic, released this week, will renew the international community?s awareness of this issue and lead to concrete follow-up measures. My delegation is deeply disturbed by the recent increase in brutal international terrorist activities. The Republic of Korea will not tolerate any acts of terrorism, and urges all Member States to cooperate in devising effective international measures to combat terrorism. On the threshold of the new millennium, the international community is encountering an increasingly complex set of challenges to peace and security. At this critical juncture, the Security Council needs to reform itself to adapt to the drastically changed international environment. The Republic of Korea fully supports an expanded, more representative and democratic Security Council. However, no Security Council reform package will be feasible without universal support among Member States. In this regard, we hope that the Council reform package will be worked out on the broadest consensus possible, far exceeding the mandatory endorsement by two thirds of the members of the General Assembly. In this context, we note with appreciation the efforts of the Working Group on Security Council reform to seek a realistic and practical solution which should enjoy general agreement among Member States. My delegation welcomes the reform efforts that Secretary-General Kofi Annan has made since taking office. The Republic of Korea has consistently supported the Secretary-General?s reform initiatives and will continue to do so in our common efforts to revitalize the Organization in the years ahead. We hope that the Millennium Assembly, to be held in the year 2000, will serve as an opportunity to crystallize the visions and strategies needed to meet the challenges of the twenty- first century. We look forward to the twenty-first century with great expectations. The time ahead of us will undoubtedly pose daunting challenges. Of this, I am certain. But it also promises a bright future if we, together, can successfully rise to the occasion. The United Nations is a tool and a forum; it is a symbol — the best that we have — of our joint commitment to making the next century more secure, more humane and more hopeful than the last one. The Republic of Korea, together with other Member States, stands ready to make its due contributions towards these lofty goals.   On behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Yemen, I have great pleasure in expressing to Mr. Opertti 38 our heartfelt congratulations on his election as President of the present session of the General Assembly. We are confident that his competence and experience will enable him to guide the sessionâs deliberations and achieve its objectives. At the same time, I should like to express our recognition of the good offices of Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the Organization, and of his great success in serving peace within the framework of preventive diplomacy in order to defuse international crises before they flare up and to protect innocent victims. I also have great pleasure in noting the intellectual and organizational efforts that are being made to revitalize United Nations activities in order to keep abreast of developments at the end of the present century and meet the demands of the next. We wish Mr. Annan every success in carrying out his future tasks. The Republic of Yemen, its Government and people, has made consistent endeavours to strengthen democratic practices based on political pluralism, freedom of the press, guarantees of public freedom and the protection of human rights. The Republic of Yemen has realized the vital importance of carrying out political, economic, financial and administrative reforms, together with a programme of stabilization and restructuring. When the due historical process brought about the unity of the country, Yemen inherited two political and economic systems based on different organizational, cultural and ideological structures. The Republic of Yemen, which represents the united Yemen, has therefore launched a process of radical political and institutional reform intended to bring about national, social and political integration, making democratic practices more deeply entrenched and increasing societyâs participation in the political decision-making process. This includes increasing the social role of Yemeni women, liberating them from all constraints on their participation and encouraging their integration in development. Naturally, bringing about economic and administrative reforms based on an open and liberal economy, free trade and the increased participation of the private sector requires new legal and administrative mechanisms which may have a negative impact on segments of society with limited income and on the unemployed. Undoubtedly, this provides an incentive for the provision of assistance for all the countries engaged in this experience, including Yemen, in order to achieve the concrete economic and financial results that can alleviate the negative impact of such changes on the social sectors that are unable to respond to the process of economic and financial adjustment and appropriate restructuring in a natural and appropriate way. That is why it is imperative for the economic reform process to be accompanied by a social safety net to ensure social and economic equilibrium and alleviate the impact of change affecting the poor, unemployed and limited- income groups, with regard to their simple lives and subsistence existence. This is a task which makes it incumbent upon the international financial institutions to recognize their responsibilities in those areas and to intensify their development programmes with social, demographic and environmental dimensions. The flow of investments and assistance from rich countries to the less developed countries have to be increased in order to bridge the structural gap and enable our society to integrate and increase its positive partnership in sustainable development. The world today is based on integration and complementarity. It aspires to globalization based on free trade, free exchange and open markets. However, these can only be achieved by regional cooperation of government and private sectors of the countries of each region. Thus our transition to globalization can be achieved through the bridges of regional cooperation, enabling us to make gains and achieve the common interests of our peoples without disregarding specificities or neglecting elements of harmony and regional integration. This approach would undoubtedly help in making concrete the spirit of fraternity, interdependence and integration, and would provide an opportunity to ensure that the fundamental factors for peace and acceptable coexistence exist, with respect to all regional parties, which will assist in ensuring a balanced and comprehensive world peace. In this context, we demand that help and assistance be provided to the developing countries and the least developed countries, in order to enable them to minimize the negative impact of the globalization of the world economy on their national economies and to achieve levels enabling them to participate with the developed countries through competitiveness in producing high quality commodities at competitive prices. This could be accomplished once they have made reasonable progress in the context of regional integration. Democracy, social justice, human rights, economic and political reforms and serious regional cooperation can 39 only be achieved when there is peace, stability and full security. Today, given the unstable nature of peace in our region, we are again apprehensive lest the situation explode. This is due to Israeli intransigence and continuous disregard of the resolutions of international legitimacy. It is also due not only to the Netanyahu Administrationâs continued rejection of international resolutions obliging Israel to withdraw from the Palestinian occupied territories, the occupied Golan Heights and South Lebanon, but also of the undertakings of the previous Administration of the late Yitzhak Rabin at the Madrid Conference and in the Oslo accords. The current construction of new settlements; the changing of the historical heritage of East Jerusalem, including the attempts to obliterate its Arab identity; the changing of historical realities and demography: all this testifies to the present Israel Governmentâs flagrant obstinacy and arrogance. We therefore demand that these practices, which present further obstacles to the peace process, be halted forthwith. In order to prevent the region being plunged back into the cycle of conflict, tension and bloodshed, we appeal to the international community to take the necessary measures to compel Israel to honour its international obligations, pursuant to the resolutions of international legitimacy and all other relevant obligations and agreements. It has become clear that the policy of starvation, deprivation and economic sanctions imposed on States, whether individually or collectively, is of no avail as an effective means to the realization of certain political goals, especially in an era in which freedom, democracy, and enhanced respect for human rights and the right to self- determination are reaffirmed. Consequently, the victims of this policy are the most vulnerable sectors of the targeted States. That is why we must reconsider the policy of imposing sanctions, and must reassess their impact, reaffirming the importance of humanitarian values and ensuring that the real interests of peoples are not arbitrarily violated or threatened for reasons of which these peoples are innocent. As we have already said, sanctions are no longer a useful tool for the realization of political objectives. We must engage in peaceful dialogue, and define a time framework and agreed criteria for the sanctions before they are imposed and put into effect. We must also ensure that the people and the poorest social sectors are not the first and direct victims, as is currently the case in Iraq and Libya. While reaffirming respect for international resolutions, we reiterate the need to lift the sanctions from Iraq and Libya. These have caused serious damage and severe human suffering in these fraternal countries. Children, old people and women have been particularly affected. Terrorism has become an international phenomenon, and its effects and repercussions are not confined to any one country, people or ideology. It concerns all nations and peoples, and there is a pressing need for the international community to respond immediately to the demand to establish a political, intellectual and institutional system at the international and regional levels in order to combat it and eradicate the causes of this uncivilized and inhuman phenomenon, and to deal with its negative consequences. In this regard, the Republic of Yemen has absolutely rejected all forms of terrorism. Yemen shares the feelings of every member of the international community: fear and concern at the continuation and increase of this anti- civilizational phenomenon which goes counter to all human values. We therefore call for genuine cooperation to combat this phenomenon collectively and responsibly. My country pays particular attention to developments in fraternal Somalia. We hope that the international community will help to resolve the conflict between the various warring factions and political groupings. But at the same time we would like to remind our brothers in Somalia that there can be no solution without the cooperation of the Somalis themselves primarily with regard to the solutions offered to them from abroad. Our concern for the situation in Somalia is a result of our feelings of fraternal responsibility, in addition to being a duty dictated by neighbourliness, especially since we are the only country in the region that has received waves of refugees from Somalia and other countries fleeing either national conflicts or purely economic circumstances. The Republic of Yemen has paid a high price and has sustained heavy suffering for its proximity to the Horn of Africa. Our modest potentialities are not adequate to deal with this human influx into our country. We already have difficulty meeting the needs of our own population. The refugees have exacerbated our difficulties, and represent an intolerable economic and social burden. The provisions made by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are insufficient to meet the 40 needs of the refugees in our country. We therefore request the international community to provide us forthwith with assistance in carrying out our humanitarian responsibilities towards our refugee brothers. We further call upon all parties in the Horn of Africa and the concerned Arab parties to cooperate in reaching realistic solutions to this protracted crisis. Many years have elapsed since the issue of reforming the United Nations was first raised, especially with regard to equitable geographical representation on the Security Council and the formulation of criteria to limit the coercive use of the veto. We fully support the call for the application of democratic norms in and universal representation on the Council in order to reflect the growth of the membership of the General Assembly since the 1950s and the major developments since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of the cold war and the expansion of the horizons of globalization â€” all of which make it imperative to reform the Security Council. It is a pressing need that must be answered if justice and democracy in international relations are to be achieved, in conformity with the increased contacts and improved relations between peoples. We therefore support the Open-ended Working Group set up for this purpose. We appreciate what has been achieved within the framework of its mandate, pursuant to the resolution of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly in 1993. We also appreciate the cooperation demonstrated by this Working Group. We call for the continuation of its work in order to fulfil its mandate at an early date. It is incumbent upon us to cooperate in creating an appropriate atmosphere for the establishment of a new international order based on justice, freedom of choice and tolerance. It is our responsibility to work together for humanity and its prosperity, and to draw ever closer to our objective to live as neighbours on the planet.  I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election. I wish you good fortune and all of us a successful session. I should also like to thank Ambassador Udovenko for the dedicated way he conducted the business of the fifty- second session. He advanced the reform process at the United Nations and kept it on the agenda. We can and must follow up these efforts. This session of the General Assembly has a special significance for my country. It was 25 years ago, almost to the day, on 19 September 1973, that Walter Scheel became the first Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany to address the United Nations. When he described our perception of the United Nations, he said that it meant more than the mere security of States, more than the mere regulation of their diplomatic relations. He said that what it is all about is the beginning and the objective of any rational policy â€” people. That description of our role in the United Nations remains valid. United Germany too feels committed to a world free from fear and want, protected by the rule of law, a world in which every individual has his opportunity and which preserves the integrity of Creation for future generations. It is the vision enshrined in the International Bill of Human Rights. We have come a lot closer to that vision over the past 25 years. The division of Germany, Europe and the world has been healed. The world is developing ever more into the â€œone worldâ€ on the foundations of democracy and human rights. But it is also becoming increasingly clear that the human race has never been so bound up together in its common destiny, united by common challenges, as it is today. The crises in Russia and Asia have shaken the world economy. The global scourges of drugs, organized crime and terrorism spread their tentacles around the globe. The year 1998 is the year of climate disasters. Two thirds of Bangladesh is under water and the Yangtze floods in China have claimed thousands of lives. No State, whether super-Power or small island State, can master these global challenges alone. And no one can escape them, least of all the suffering people: the homeless in Bangladesh, the drug addict in Europe, the victim of civil war in Africa. We can shape our future only through joint efforts. We therefore need global action and global management for the global challenges of the twenty-first century; not tomorrow or the day after, but today. This is a test not only for Governments but also for the other global players: the non-governmental organizations and the multinational corporations. Never were the non-governmental organizations so important as they are today. Without them the Ottawa Convention banning landmines could not have been signed in December 1997. And, let us not forget, 51 of the worldâs hundred largest economic entities are now companies, and only 49 of them States. All this shows that the time has come for new alliances for peace, freedom and prosperity throughout the world. The age of globalization is the age of the United Nations. Only here do all nations of the world come together. Only here can we find joint solutions to the global challenges of today and tomorrow. This is why we Germans want to help get the United Nations in shape for the twenty-first century. We are facing up to this responsibility â€” as the second largest export nation and the third largest economy in the world, and as the country with the largest population in the European Union. We owe Secretary-General Kofi Annan our gratitude and support for his reform proposals. Now it is up to the Member States. The Security Council still mirrors the world as it was at the end of the Second World War, but not the enhanced status of Asia, Africa and Latin America with the Caribbean. The same is true of the greater weight of Japan and united Germany. I wish to thank all Member States that advocate a permanent seat for Germany on the Security Council. Security Council reform cannot be delayed any longer; otherwise, the momentum will be lost and that would be bad indeed. 16 Since the ending of the cold war the United Nations has had more burdens to shoulder than ever. It therefore needs effective institutions, and for this reason it has a right to expect members to pay their dues on time. All, and especially the big members, must help according to their ability to ensure that the world Organization can accomplish its tasks. Germany, the third largest contributor, will continue to meet its obligations. We know from recent experience that we should not add to but rather ease the burden of the United Nations. This is a task especially for regional organizations like the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Organization of African Unity (OAU). If they succeed in settling conflicts locally, the Security Council will not need to deal with them. I think that would be very well-advised, because it would free capacities for all of us. New avenues of joint action are therefore called for. To pretend globalization is not happening would be absurd. Only those who face up to the challenge can exploit the opportunities and cushion the risks. The impact of the crises in Russia and Asia shows that the world economy needs a reliable framework. That is not to say we need a global financial authority or fixed exchange rates, least of all a new wave of protectionism. But we do need better early-warning mechanisms, more transparency and more efficient banking systems, especially in the newly emerging economies. This is not a task for Governments alone. What is needed now is a global public-private partnership between Governments, international financial organizations and corporations. We therefore support the American initiative for a dialogue between the G-8 and the newly emerging economies on a new international financial architecture. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank should not always have to serve as the stopgap when the opportunity for structural reforms has been missed. Managing globalization also means weaving a network of partnerships between the big regional groupings and the big countries. The regional groupings are the components of a new global order under the roof of the United Nations. The European Unionâs partnerships with regional organizations like the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) prove we are on the right course: We want an open, not a confrontational, kind of regionalism. I am confident that the European Union will be an anchor of stability in the twenty-first century. By introducing a single currency on 1 January 1999, it is focusing its energies. Its global role will increase. It is about to begin further negotiations on accession with associated partners. What Willy Brandt said about Germany in 1989 applies today to the whole of Europe: â€œWhat belongs together is now growing togetherâ€. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) too is also gradually opening its doors to the new democracies. In the year of its fiftieth anniversary it will admit Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Together with Russia, Ukraine and the other Commonwealth of Independent States members, we are developing a comprehensive security partnership. True, the Russians are having a rough time at present, but the world needs a democratic and stable Russia, a Russia which will play the role commensurate with its size, its status and its potential. Russia faces a Herculean task of consolidating the economy and maintaining social stability. All those responsible must face up to the challenge: the President, the Government, the parties and business. Of course, the regions too are called upon. I know from my talks with Prime Minister Primakov last week in Moscow that Russia intends neither to change course nor to go into reverse. The crisis in Russia affects us all. We will not abandon Russia. It can count on us. The Kosovo conflict remains a thorn in Europeâs side. A humanitarian disaster in the true sense of the word is looming. The situation of the refugees, more than 250,000 of them, is desperate. International organizations, the European Union, the United States and Russia are coordinating their efforts to enable those who have been driven out to return to their villages. Time is getting short; winter is just around the corner. Most of the responsibility for this drama lies with Belgrade, with President Milosevic. He must realize that the international community will react with military force if necessary. We still seek a political solution for Kosovo â€” self-administration within the Yugoslav Federation. However, this cannot be achieved without Belgrade and Pristina. So the weapons must now be silenced. We condemn the use of force by the Yugoslav security forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army. The recent reports we have received from Kosovo are very 17 disappointing, troubling and worrisome. I hope they are not true. NATO is prepared to provide the backing for a political solution. Yugoslavia and Kosovo are a part of Europe. Their future can only be a European one. The history of Europe in this century shows that we can overcome hatred and mistrust. But we have to have the willingness to do so. In Bosnia, too, we have seen animosity slowly being replaced by trust and cooperation. Recently I paid my twelfth visit to Sarajevo. That tormented city is slowly beginning to blossom again, and the countryâs reconstruction is progressing. Nonetheless, the peace process must continue to be buttressed by NATO and the Stabilization Force (SFOR), for the process is not self-sustaining. Regardless of the result of the elections, the international community will not tolerate any reversal of the implementation of the peace agreement. Furthermore, genuine peace will not return until the presumed war criminals and enemies of peace â€” Mr. Karadzic and his lot â€” have been brought to trial in The Hague. Only when those guilty of crimes against humanity, torturers and terrorists all over the world, have been brought to justice will we all be able to sleep peacefully. Thus, the establishment of the International Criminal Court on 17 July as a major step towards a world order in which the force of law, not the law of force, prevails. Germany was the driving force. I appeal to all countries to sign and ratify the Courtâs Statute. No one stands more at the mercy of those who wield power than refugees. At present more than 20 million people worldwide are in flight: despairing elderly people, women, children; people who are sick, homeless and destitute and have absolutely no idea what is going to happen to them. Over the last several years I have been to many refugee camps, in Albania, Africa and the Middle East. Every refugeeâs case is a story of immeasurable human suffering. Germany is now the country with the second largest number of refugees. From Kosovo alone, 150,000 refugees have found refuge in Germany. The suffering of the refugees is a humanitarian and political challenge to the international community as a whole. What is now needed, therefore, is a global refugee policy. The United Nations, too, has to do something about it. Specifically, this means, first, a more equitable distribution of the refugees, as I recommended here in the General Assembly in 1993. We cannot leave the poorest countries to their own devices in trying to cope with the refugee problem. Secondly, greater efforts will have to be made to remove the causes of flight and expulsion. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has declared the twenty-first century a century of prevention, and with good reason. To wait until a situation gets so bad that people have to take flight is to make oneself partly responsible. Trouble must therefore be nipped in the bud. This is the task of preventive diplomacy, of human rights observers and peacekeeping forces. Striking at the root of mass flight and migration also means eliminating the economic, ecological and social causes. The gap between rich and poor grows wider. The wealthiest 20 per cent of the world population consume 86 per cent of all goods, the poorest 20 per cent only 1.3 per cent. This equity gap must be closed. Every individual has a right to live in dignity, free from hunger and want. All nations must be given a fair chance in global competition, the poorest ones in particular. Hence, it is up to the rich countries to help the poor make the most of their opportunities for development. Our aim is a social world market economy. This is why in 1997 Germany spent 10.25 billion deutsche marks on bilateral and multilateral assistance measures â€” an investment in peace and stability. Africa shows what can be achieved when the international community and the countries concerned pull together. Today, democratic elections are held in more than half of the African countries. In 20 African countries economic growth is between 4 and 6 per cent, and in 11 it is higher still. We want the Africans to know that we will not abandon that vast continent and its 800 million people, despite the heavy burdens it still has to bear. 18 Poverty and refugee problems are also exacerbating the situation in the Middle East. The people in Israel and in the Palestinian territories long for peace more than anything else on earth. The peace process requires fresh impetus. The Israelis and Palestinians must move towards each other again and rediscover the lost mutual trust. We Europeans will continue to support this process with our American friends. We back Israelâs legitimate claim to security for its State and citizens. The Palestinians have recognized that claim; now words must be followed by deeds. They must see to it that terrorism has no chance. But Israel, too, must show compromise as regards a further partial withdrawal. Neither side should put any new obstacles in the way of a deal â€” and that includes allowing new settlements in the occupied territories. Particularly in the Middle East, we have time and again seen that terrorism leads to a dead end, destruction and suffering. We must pit all our strength against the cynics who advocate violence, the fanatics and ideologues; the dead of Omagh, Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam serve as a warning. Those who plant bombs and murder people must be brought to justice. Drying up the sources of terrorism â€” poverty, ethnic conflict and fundamentalism â€” is our common responsibility. But to fight terrorism is not to fight Islam. Islam is one of the great world religions. Nothing could be further from the truth than the clichÃ© that Islam is synonymous with fundamentalism and violations of human rights. We want a dialogue of cultures and religions, especially with Islam. There exists an ethic of humanity that unites us all. This ethic is based on the inalienable dignity of every individual, as expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the human rights covenants of the United Nations. These are the benchmarks for our joint action in the twenty-first century. Violations of human rights are no longer an internal matter of States. They concern us all. Any group which, like the regime in Kabul, denies women their basic human rights places itself outside the international community of common values. The world of tomorrow will be judged by how we treat our children today. They are our most valuable asset. Yet the rights of many children are still being trampled underfoot. Millions of children have no chance to live a life in dignity. Millions of children are forced to work. Particularly appalling is the fact that every year some two million children all over the world are sexually abused. Only through joint action can we stop child prostitution, traffic in children and child pornography, including that proliferated via the Internet. I therefore propose that the United Nations set up a contact point to coordinate worldwide efforts to eradicate sexual abuse of children. The optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child designed to afford better protection against sexual exploitation should be quickly adopted and quickly put into effect. Children are small people who need big rights. Protection for children during armed conflicts must be improved, including by outlawing their use as soldiers. We all hoped that with the ending of the East-West confrontation the danger of a nuclear conflagration would be gone forever. This has proved to be an illusion. The threat of proliferation of means of mass destruction hovers over the human race. We can safeguard world peace in the twenty-first century only if we keep such terrible weapons under control. In Geneva, India and Pakistan have agreed to negotiations on a cut-off. Thatâs a good sign, but not nearly enough. It must be followed by their accession to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. And all nations should now sign the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. This also applies to the conventions banning chemical and biological weapons. The adoption of a verification protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention is now urgent. Next March the Ottawa Convention imposing a worldwide ban on anti-personnel landmines enters into force â€” a great success. Only if all countries now sign the Convention will these diabolical devices soon be wiped from the face of the earth. It is our common task to get rid of the 100 million mines still remaining, using state-of-the-art technology. We must also radically rethink our attitude to nature. The victims of the floods in China and Bangladesh are a warning. We must swing the wheel round now. This we owe to our children and grandchildren. We can save our blue planet and its ecosystem together or not at all. 19 Take the world climate. The Kyoto Protocol launched a global effort to protect it. That was a big step forward. But time is getting short. We have just had the warmest half year this century. At the fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, scheduled for Buenos Aires in November, we shall have to agree on the instruments with which to achieve the objectives of Kyoto. Take water. Water is irreplaceable. Water is more important than oil. Yet in more than 80 countries it is in short supply. Two billion people have insufficient access or none at all to clean drinking water. Finding joint solutions for the peaceful use and conservation of water, the source of life, is one of the great tasks of the twenty-first century. The pursuit of this scarce commodity must not be allowed to spark fresh conflicts. Germany intends to remain in the vanguard of the international campaign to protect the environment. I am gratified to note that our commitment has been acknowledged by the appointment of Klaus TÃ¶pfer as Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme. But we are not going to rest on our laurels. A few days ago I opened an international conference in Potsdam on early-warning mechanisms for natural disasters. The conference has shown that progress can be achieved if we want it. Specifically, it is now a question of establishing effective global early-warning systems for environmental crises and natural disasters, and developing emergency management arrangements for the coordination of international relief measures. We must now get down to this task, and the United Nations is the right place to do so. Four hundred and sixty three days from now the twentieth century comes to an end â€” a century of unprecedented violence and destruction. The coming century must be a century with a humane countenance. What a wonderful vision. But talking about it is not enough. Only if we act together will we survive together. The United Nations is indispensable to this task. Strengthening it to secure a peaceful and more equitable world â€” that is our responsibility. This we owe to coming generations. My country will devote every possible effort to this task.  On behalf of the people and the Government of Sao Tome and Principe, and on my own account, I congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session, and wish you success in carrying out your duties. On the occasion of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe would like to join with all other countries of the world in advocating the cause of development, peace and liberty for all the world’s people. We want also to state our deep concern at the grave problems which affect mankind and which pose a threat to the world. We are one year away from the beginning of a new millennium, and it is with sadness that we observe a world deeply divided between North and South, rich and poor, and developed and underdeveloped countries. The African continent continues its process of healing and its struggle towards development. In recent decades many countries of our continent have become independent and democratic, and are ready for the open market. Some of them have experienced significant economic growth. Economic reforms and democracy have made them favourable ground for development. However, against this background, many African countries have become poorer. Bad management and various types of crisis have given these countries very few opportunities for development. In 1996, 240 million Africans were living on less than one dollar per day. Africa’s share of international trade was only 2 per cent, and the continent received 2 per cent of foreign investment. Poverty is increasing, and political instability is creating violent conflicts which are very difficult to control. With deep sadness, we observe too many armed conflicts, such as those in Sudan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, the Great Lakes region, Guinea-Bissau, Eritrea and so on. Too many lives have been lost; too much economic infrastructure and too many homes have been destroyed; too many refugees have been created. That is the result of armed conflicts in our continent. This situation merits the attention of all in order to prevent armed conflicts, by creating an environment for dialogue and reconciliation based on democratic principles, good governance and respect for the human rights of minorities. The situation in Guinea-Bissau requires the special attention of the international community in order to promote dialogue between all the parties in conflict. We participated in negotiations as a member of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, together with the Southern African Development Community, and our mediation resulted in a ceasefire. We appeal to both parties to create a good environment to secure peace and tranquillity and restore the normal functioning of democratic institutions and respect for the Constitution. 19 Angola is also our concern. We call on the international community to avoid another war in that country. We also appeal to UNITA and to the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation, of which UNITA is a part, to fulfil all the objectives of the Lusaka Protocol and work for peace and development. The situation in Central Africa and the Great Lakes region is for us the most worrying in our continent. I do not want to exaggerate, but I can say that this subregion is in flames which can spread into other countries. Our desire is to work together with the international community and all countries in the subregion to seek a solution. Despite all the approaches already made to end the conflict peacefully, we cannot remain inactive while the conflict is widening, with catastrophic consequences. The international community must continue to work for peace to stop the suffering of innocent people. Besides the conflicts on the African continent, there are others, such as that in East Timor. The East Timorese people have been suffering under foreign occupation. They are fighting for self-determination, the right to freely choose their own destiny, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. If we deny them those rights, we contradict the principles of our Organization. Against this background, we reaffirm our support for the Maubere people in their struggle for self-determination. We appeal to the United Nations and the international community to continue supporting the negotiations to reach a peaceful end of the conflict. The world is facing serious environmental problems. The development of programmes to protect our planet must be a priority, and we must work together to avoid behaviour that damages the environment by creating pollution, land degradation and destruction in general. We need to follow the Rio Declaration if we want a safe environment and sound development. We have to pay special attention to the problems of desertification, water pollution, deforestation and biological diversity. I would like to call attention to resolution 2758 (XXVI), adopted in 1971, which denied over 21.8 million people their right to international representation and totally contravenes the principle of universality, consecrated in the Charter. The admission of the Republic of China on Taiwan as one of our own would not pose a challenge to any of the existing Members, and the peaceful coexistence of the two sides in this Organization would be a catalyst to end one of the largest and most enduring sources of instability in Asia. Taking into consideration this and the changes that have taken place in international relations, we call on the General Assembly to review resolution 2758 (XXVI). Fifty-three years after the United Nations was founded, I would like once again to emphasize and praise the positive contribution this Organization has made to freedom, development and peace. The Organization faces more and more challenges, and it is necessary and convenient to proceed with reform of the system to make it capable of responding to the demands upon it. The reform must also include the Security Council; it is time to reform its structure to provide a better geographical representation. It is our understanding that a more democratic, efficient and less bureaucratic United Nations may better shoulder its obligations and carry out its duties, in order to guarantee progress and universal peace. The struggle against organized crime, drugs, money laundering and international terrorism must be one of the priorities of the United Nations and of all countries. Everybody must contribute to fighting these problems and their catastrophic consequences. My country is facing a difficult moment in its history. The economy of Sao Tome and Principe has been undergoing deep changes. Statistical data show that there is a significant improvement. It seems that inflation has slowed; there is an improvement in the fiscal system and the value of the national currency has risen. The Government has been making efforts in order to achieve satisfactory results in the area of economic development and reducing poverty. One of our concerns is related to the problem of our high foreign debt, estimated at nearly $270 million and which is 54 times greater than the value of our exports. Despite all the efforts that have been made, these numbers are still tragic. It is essential for Sao Tome and Principe to benefit from having its foreign debt forgiven. It is very important for us to be able to participate in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative. In closing, I would like to thank the United Nations and its specialized agencies for the support given to my country.  Let me first associate myself with the statement by my colleague, the Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the European Union. We embark upon this session of the General Assembly in the midst of challenges that affect all continents. We can deal with those challenges only if we display resolve and a common vision. That vision, clear and simple, is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. We must strive to maintain international peace and security, respect for human rights and dignified living conditions for all. Every State joining the United Nations has committed itself to that vision. To realize our vision, the rule of law must prevail. We base our national societies on the rule of law, and much is made of the rule of law within our societies. The rule of law offers the strongest defense against arbitrary exercise of power, but we sometimes neglect its importance in the international context. My call for greater commitment to the rule of law internationally is not meant to belittle the progress made. The Charter has inspired an impressive body of specific treaty law governing the behaviour of States. Laws on human rights, disarmament, the environment and outer space, and the law of the sea and international trade law are important examples. We celebrate this year the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, proclaimed by the General Assembly in December 1948. The Declaration covers civil and political rights, as well as economic, social, and cultural rights. It has had an immense impact upon the standard-setting work of the United Nations and within each Member State. Human rights are universal. They must be guaranteed to all persons without discrimination and observed by all countries irrespective of their form of government. That is the essence of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Indeed, it would be contradictory to talk about human rights if they were not accorded to all human beings, wherever they live. To deny the universality of human rights is to deny our common humanity. Freedom from torture, for example, must be respected everywhere, regardless of local traditions or local problems. Obviously, situations differ, but the human rights foundation is the same everywhere. All States in Vienna in 1993 reaffirmed that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights constitutes a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations. All States further proclaimed that the promotion and protection of human rights is a legitimate concern of the international community. A feature of present-day international law is that, by now, we have almost all the standards against which to hold Governments accountable for their acts. What we are still missing is an effective international machinery to ensure the implementation of all the rules in practice â€” to move from declarations to deeds. I wish to pay special tribute to the many human rights defenders who struggle in the front line for the defence of our common human values, often at the greatest personal risk. 15 It is a most proper contribution by the United Nations to adopt this year a declaration for the protection of the work of human rights defenders, those who strive to realize the solemn pledges contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We also warmly welcome the progress made in firmly establishing the rights of indigenous peoples. Another landmark contribution was achieved this year through the historic adoption in Rome of a Statute for a permanent International Criminal Court. Time and again, we have observed the failure of national criminal law systems to punish the perpetrators of atrocities and those behind them. The shocking events from Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and now Kosovo and elsewhere are fresh on our minds. The prospects for reconciliation and lasting peace are undermined if the perpetrators remain at large. A key objective of the International Criminal Court is exactly to restore the rule of law and end impunity. This is a matter not only of justice, but also of peace and security. The ad hoc Tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia have been an important first step, but only a preliminary step. We need a permanent institution. Denmark urges all States to ratify the Statute of the International Criminal Court. It is an urgent task to set this historic building block in the construction of international society in place. In light of experiences gained, the door is open for adjusting the functioning of the Court to the needs of the world community. The review clause in the Statute â€” a proposition strongly advocated by Denmark all along in the negotiations â€” assures that. The signature in December last year in Ottawa by 121 States of the Convention to ban the use and production of anti-personnel landmines has established a very important norm in international humanitarian law. For too long has this inhumane, indiscriminate weapon been allowed to claim thousands of innocent civilian victims every year. We welcome the entry into force of the Convention by 1 March 1999. Let us now intensify our joint efforts to clear the many mines already in the ground. Denmark offers its continued support. A most disturbing factor in the international legal order are the terrorist attacks taking innocent lives and jeopardizing relations among States. The international community must continue to condemn all acts, methods and practices of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable under all circumstances, wherever and by whomsoever committed. No ends justify such means, but, apparently, condemnation is not enough. We need to further strengthen international cooperation to prevent, combat and eliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. There must be no safe haven for terrorists. Those responsible for terrorist acts must be brought to justice. If traditional extradition agreements cannot bring about such a result, less traditional arrangements must be contemplated, as envisaged in regard to the horrendous terrorist bombing over Lockerbie. In May this year, India, regrettably, decided to resume nuclear testing after 24 years of self-imposed restraint. Pakistan, regrettably, followed Indiaâs lead and conducted its own tests for the first time. These tests not only contradict the non-test norm that had developed over the past two years. They also endanger peace and stability in the region and internationally. Therefore, the nuclear testing by India and Pakistan is of legitimate concern to the international community. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons enjoys almost universal support. A substantial number of countries have ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and more are following every month. These two Treaties are the cornerstones of the international non-proliferation regime and the foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament. I urge those countries â€” including India and Pakistan â€” that have not yet done so, to sign and move to ratify these Treaties without condition. This year marks the first half-century of United Nations peacekeeping. The first mission was established 50 years ago, based on the goals of the United Nations Charter. Since then, United Nations peacekeeping has developed norms and principles of its own: consent of the parties, impartiality and non-use of force. These principles continue to guide the international communityâs efforts in securing peace and stability on all continents. Peacekeeping operations are an important illustration of the resolve of the international community, represented by the United Nations. Their successes are real. In the Middle East and Cyprus, the United Nations has been a source of stability for many years. In Mozambique, United Nations peacekeepers have demobilized thousands of combatants and made room for democratic elections. In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the 16 United Nations preventive deployment remains an essential stabilizing factor. And in Bosnia and Herzegovina today, the United Nations is responsible for the crucial task of training and restructuring local police forces. Denmark has a long tradition of contributing to United Nations peacekeeping operations. Danish forces took part from the very beginning and have served the United Nations faithfully for the last five decades. In recent years, Danish forces have served all over the world, from the Middle East to the Balkans, as well as in Asia and in Africa. Todayâs peacekeeping challenges differ from those of earlier decades and much work has been done to adjust the United Nations to the new challenges. Denmark has taken an active part in the process. Together with other countries, Denmark aims to improve the United Nations capacity for rapid reaction within the framework of the standby system. Denmark is also engaged in the creation of a new peacekeeping capacity of the Baltic States and of southern Africa. The demand for adjustment and reform continues. There is still work to be done in areas such as preplanning and logistic support. But peacekeeping goes beyond military operations. A broader, integrated approach involving components such as civilian police, preventive diplomacy and humanitarian assistance is called for. Such conceptual flexibility will add to the strength of United Nations peacekeeping. We, the United Nations Members, must be ready to meet our obligations and equip the Organization with the necessary tools for these future challenges. We must also, of course, ensure the safety of personnel working for the United Nations. We are witnessing an enhanced role for regional organizations. Their special expertise has proved valuable in addressing causes of conflict and establishing a basis for settlement. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is a good example. A division of labour between organizations is necessary, but it must not lead to confusion in leadership and responsibility. The United Nations remains the core institution in the international legal order and must maintain a central role in international efforts to ensure peace and security. We are approaching the twenty-first century, a century in which international society also should be governed by the rule of law. The norms of international law are universal but, sadly, they are not always universally respected. Respect for national sovereignty cannot be invoked as an excuse to avoid the obligations of international cooperation and international law. International criticism of violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law is fully legitimate. The role of the United Nations in this respect remains crucial. Indeed, direct intervention by the international community through the United Nations can be fully justified and legitimate, including in grave cases of humanitarian law being violated. Respect for the rule of law in international relations can be ensured only if the international community and the United Nations possess the instruments and the resolve to act. In this respect, regrettably, we must note a certain paralysis in recent years in the face of grave humanitarian conflicts and emergencies. Disagreement among Member States on how to deal with a particular crisis weakens the resolve of the United Nations to act. But we must, unfortunately, also note a lack of general support for the United Nations in certain quarters. The least we can expect from Members is for them to make the necessary resources available for the Organization, inter alia, by paying their contributions in full, on time and without conditions. We must find ways which enhance the ability of the United Nations to deal with violations of international peace and security and other serious breaches of international law. Failure to act on such challenges is morally indefensible and betrays the principles of the United Nations Charter. Violations and breaches must be met convincingly, with resolve and with the legitimacy of international law. Legitimacy will usually be provided by the Security Council. That is how it should be. Disagreement in the Security Council about a particular line of action must, however, never lead to the paralysis of the international community. If, for instance, members of the Security Council cannot agree on a mandate for a peace operation, they must allow for other possibilities for effective action. 17 When faced with an urgent agenda, the option should not be action or no action, but what line of action. There will usually be a broad range of actions available for the international community. It is a question of choice and political will. It does not suffice to leave everything to the humanitarian agencies. Emergency relief, however necessary, is not a substitute for political action. A reform of the Security Council can serve to strengthen the authority of the Council. But in the end we depend on the readiness of the members of the Council to act and to apply the same yardstick to all cases. I should also like to emphasize the role and prerogatives of the Secretary-General in the field of peace and security. The Secretary-General has exercised these functions in a highly commendable way. Before concluding, I wish to refer to the normative role of the United Nations as an important aspect of the rule of law. In particular, the United Nations conferences of the past decade have set valuable norms for improving living conditions for mankind. Common standards have been set in such important areas as eradication of poverty, environmentally sustainable development, gender equality and promotion and protection of human rights. Achievements have been made in meeting these standards, but much remains to be done. The responsibility falls both to Member States and to the international institutions. The United Nations system must ensure, on its part, an effective and coordinated follow-up to the global United Nations conferences. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that the financial resources are provided to attain these common standards. Denmark will continue to contribute development assistance in the amount of 1 per cent of our gross national product. Let me conclude by expressing my conviction that the best way to promote the rule of law in international relations is through respect for democratic norms in our own societies. The norm-setting activities of the United Nations have given an indispensable impetus towards democratization and good governance. Assistance to the establishment of democratic institutions in developing countries and countries with economies in transition can also make an important contribution. This is an overriding objectives of Denmarkâs considerable assistance to those countries. Whatever challenges we face to the international legal order, we must never fail in our determination to follow the words of the preamble of the Charter: â€œto reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and smallâ€.  Let me at the very outset extend to Mr. Opertti our warm congratulations upon his election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty- third session. We are particularly pleased to see presiding the Foreign Minister of Uruguay, a country with which Ireland has always enjoyed the friendliest of relations. His rich experience in politics, education, diplomacy and the law will serve the Assembly well as he directs its work for the coming year. Also on behalf of the Irish people, I wish to pay a particular tribute to the Secretary-General for the thoughtful and determined leadership which he has brought from the African continent to the discharge of his most challenging office. Commitment to the work of this Organization is a central part of Ireland?s foreign policy and of her place in the world. Irish people strongly support that commitment. We feel close bonds with the United Nations. With many like-minded countries, we have striven to uphold and develop the universal role of the Organization for the promotion of peace, development, international cooperation and human rights. These purposes are linked in the Charter and they are linked in reality. All around us, side by side with rapid technological and material development, we see in every region of the world uncertainty, insecurity and conflict. Our attention has been gripped this year by the severe economic and financial difficulties which are besetting developed and emerging markets as well as economies in transition. The full effects of these difficulties have yet to play themselves out. We are all affected. More than 1 billion people struggle to survive on less than a dollar a day. Environmental degradation and natural disasters wreak unnecessary havoc on entire nations. Meanwhile, obscenely disproportionate levels of resources are diverted to fuel the arms trade and supply the unjustifiably large arsenals in parts of the world that can least afford it. Human rights remain to be fully respected in all regions. I think that these realities are among the root causes of the conflicts confronting us today. If the new millennium is to open with real prospects of alleviating such conflict situations, it is the root causes which we must together tackle; prevention is always better, and certainly less costly, than cure. As my Swedish colleague has said, the Austrian Presidency has spoken and addressed the Assembly on behalf of the 15 Member States of the European Union, expressing our position on many issues. Nevertheless, I will focus my remarks on a number of issues which are of particular importance to the country which I represent. We should all acknowledge that there can be no real peace or security without development. Development is about dignity and offering impoverished people around the world the chance of a better life now and better prospects for their children. This is not too much to ask. Its achievement, however, requires a new partnership of international engagement and commitment. All of us must share a determination to break down the walls of exclusion and marginalization that divide our world. A new partnership must address not only aid flows but also the crippling problem of debt. It must assist developing countries to participate on a fair basis in the world economy. Development cooperation is not only about reducing unacceptable levels of poverty. All countries, developed and developing alike, must together address shared priorities that affect all our countries and all our peoples. An integrated approach is called for, as previous speakers have mentioned. In this context, I welcome in particular the seminal report of the Secretary-General — I have already welcomed it in a committee today — on the causes of conflict and sustainable development in Africa. We will work actively with other Member States to ensure that this report receives the strongly positive response it deserves. I will allude for a moment to Ireland?s development cooperation programme, if I may. As for Ireland?s contribution, it is with some pride that I can say that we have one of the fastest growing development cooperation programmes in the world today. The Irish Government is committed to reaching the United Nations target for official development assistance — that is, 0.7 per cent of gross national product — and I think it?s fair to say that we are fully determined to make further progress towards this goal in the coming years. Last week, my Government agreed on a package of debt alleviation measures for developing countries, in the multilateral and bilateral fields, amounting to some $46 million, which is a considerable sum of money for a country the size of Ireland, and I think it was a measure 36 of the bona fides of our intention in this whole area of development cooperation. For Ireland, support for development cooperation means, by definition, support for the United Nations in this vital area. The United Nations has only the resources which the Member States give it. These must reflect our political commitment to confront challenges. I think that is why declining contributions to core resources for United Nations funds, programmes and agencies are a matter of deep and grave concern. For its part, Ireland has increased significantly the level of its commitment. I am pleased to say that our Development Assistance Programme now supports 32 funds, programmes and agencies of the United Nations system, compared to 13 just five years ago. I pledge before this Assembly the continuation of Ireland?s support in that regard. Again, the question of disarmament and nuclear disarmament was raised by my Swedish colleague, the previous speaker. The end of the cold war provided the international community with a unique opportunity to accomplish the final elimination of nuclear weapons and to usher in a nuclear-free world. Yet, while the past 10 years have witnessed important steps to reduce nuclear arsenals, there has been no clear commitment on the part of nuclear- weapon States to proceed rapidly to nuclear disarmament, as required by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Ireland?s advocacy of nuclear disarmament has been consistent and unrelenting. We have been the strongest protagonists of the achievement of the goals of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which Ireland proposed in 1958 and was the author of at that time. We must begin to take certain fundamental steps now to achieve the NPT?s non- discriminatory and universal application. We cannot enter the third millennium with the prospect that nuclear weapons will be considered legitimate for the indefinite future. That is why Ireland has, this year, joined with seven like-minded States — Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia, South Africa and Sweden — to launch the declaration “Towards a Nuclear-Weapons-Free World: The Need for A New Agenda”. The steps called for in the New Agenda are premised on a clear and unambiguous commitment to be undertaken by the five nuclear-weapon States to engage in nuclear disarmament negotiations within an entirely new context. They are also premised on a similar commitment by the three nuclear-weapon-capable States — India, Pakistan and, of course, Israel — not parties to the NPT. This session of the General Assembly provides a unique opportunity to give substance to proposals such as those contained in the Joint Ministerial Declaration of 9 June. My colleagues and I have therefore prepared a draft resolution which sets out an agenda for the definitive elimination of nuclear weapons for all time and which we ask the Assembly to consider and adopt in the First Committee. On the question of landmines, coincidentally and fortuitously, last week I presided over a landmine conference in Dublin while the International Campaign to Ban Landmines was meeting in my own capital city to develop a civil-society-based landmine monitor. We received the welcome news that the fortieth ratification of the landmines Convention had just taken place. We now have a total ban in place and can set our minds to eradicating these obscene instruments and their consequences. The inexcusable delay in addressing the question of landmines was a glaring failure of the international community to look squarely at an issue of human security which was fundamental to development. Another example is the persistence of expenditure on arms in certain countries, which is out of all proportion to social spending. This state of affairs must cease and the arms trade that feeds it must be curtailed. I would personally like to see it stopped and put out of existence. On the question of human rights, a further and very pervasive root cause of instability and conflict is inadequate respect of the very rights of which I am speaking. There are too many specific instances of human rights abuse in every region of the world. There are hopeful signs — for example, in Nigeria and East Timor — but elsewhere the situation remains bleak. In this, the fiftieth anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we must reaffirm our collective commitment to promoting respect for these rights and freedoms by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal recognition and observance. The Universal Declaration, in my view, is as relevant today as it was five decades ago when it was drafted by the representatives of developed and developing countries with important input from members of civil society. It is a universal benchmark. 37 We all have questions to answer. The first might be: How have we lived up to the standards set out in the Universal Declaration? What steps have we taken to build on the Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted five years ago by consensus at the Vienna Conference, which specifically reaffirmed the right to development? These are some questions that we might well ask ourselves during the current session of the Assembly. On the question of capital punishment, another important human rights issue is the abuse of the death penalty. Ireland will continue to work for the universal abolition of capital punishment. We welcome the fact that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, again at its recent fifty-fourth session, addressed this issue directly. We also welcome the adoption in July of the Statute for the International Criminal Court at the international conference hosted so effectively by Italy. This is truly a landmark development. Nobody is and nobody should be above the law. We fervently hope that the Statute will enter into force on the earliest possible date and that it will secure universal adherence. Finally, let me join with those many others who have given support and encouragement to the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The promotion of international cooperation in this key area must remain one of this great Organization?s first priorities. On the question of conflict prevention, I now turn to the maintenance of international peace and security, which, of course, is the prime responsibility and prime aim of the United Nations. The painful experiences of this decade — notably in the former Yugoslavia, Africa and the Middle East — have prompted much soul-searching and, of course, analysis. In Kosovo, we are witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe which could replicate the horrors of Bosnia. The international community must take urgent and effective action within the framework of the United Nations to ensure that our worst fears are not realized. Another humanitarian disaster faces us in Sudan. Recently, I saw for myself the terrible suffering of its people. I visited the epicentre of the famine in Ajip in southern Sudan, having spent three hours getting there from a town called Lokichokio in northern Kenya, which was a staging post for aid for that part of the terribly blighted country of southern Sudan. It is not acceptable that we allow this tragedy to continue. One of the essential conclusions, here again, is the need to address the origins of conflict and not just the symptoms. Foresight and adaptability are necessary. In this context, I welcome in particular the emphasis which the Secretary-General has placed on the need to tackle the root causes of conflict in all their complex diversity. We support his strengthening of United Nations early-warning mechanisms and his prioritizing of preventive diplomacy. The many strengths and capabilities of the United Nations and the regional organizations in the area of conflict prevention must be harnessed and focused to achieve greater use of resources. The General Assembly, for its part, is placing ever greater emphasis on conflict prevention. It has commended not least the efforts of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and acknowledged the contribution of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), a regional organization which Ireland fully supports. On the question of peacekeeping, in this, the fiftieth anniversary year of United Nations peacekeeping, I want to pay tribute to the peacekeepers who currently serve the Organization. They do so often in very difficult and dangerous circumstances. Too many have made the ultimate sacrifice. Since 1958, Ireland has been at the forefront of United Nations peacekeeping. In this period, some 40,000 Irish peacekeepers have served with the Organization across the world. Seventy-five of my fellow Irishmen have given their lives. Among Member States, Ireland is currently one of the leading troop contributors. My President, Mrs. Mary McAleese, in one of her earliest official engagements, visited our peacekeepers in Lebanon. Again, this underlines Ireland?s active commitment to bringing peace to that part of the world. The world continues to need United Nations peacekeeping, but its operations must be based on sound mandates and have solid political and financial support. Colleagues have mentioned the question of United Nations reform. Mobilizing the political will to tackle the interrelated causes of insecurity and conflict, I believe, is only the first step. The United Nations as an institution must be strengthened and given the necessary resources to carry through its work. Timely funding by Member States is a prerequisite. 38 Ireland believes that the reform process should not be viewed as a cost-cutting exercise. The wretched expression “downsizing” comes to mind. It is about making the Organization more effective in the discharge of its Charter functions, especially in the economic, social and humanitarian fields. I welcome the progress achieved to date. Ireland will continue with other like-minded States to build partnerships among the membership so that real progress can be achieved. We have views in relation to the area of Security Council reform. A reinvigorated United Nations must include a reformed Security Council that reflects the realities and the needs of today?s world. We believe that the Council must work more transparently and that its membership should be enlarged to ensure a more equitable representation. To this end, we have joined with a group of like-minded States in putting forward a number of specific proposals. We will continue to work for an agreed outcome on this issue of crucial importance to the future of this Organization of ours. On the question of Ireland?s candidature, Ireland believes that all Member States — small, like ourselves, as well as large — should have an opportunity to serve on the Security Council, the body on which the Members of the Organization have conferred primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. The Assembly will be aware that Ireland has presented its candidature for non-permanent membership of the Security Council for the two-year term 2001-2002. Throughout its membership of the United Nations, Ireland has worked to play a bridge-building role among Member States. As a member of the Security Council, Ireland?s approach would similarly reflect the interests of the totality of the broad spectrum of the membership. I can give the Assembly some good news about Northern Ireland. My predecessors have by custom informed this Assembly of our efforts to help promote peace in Northern Ireland. It is my deep privilege, therefore, to convey an account of a breakthrough of great importance: the Agreement reached by the British and Irish Governments and eight Northern Ireland parties in Belfast on Good Friday, 10 April 1998. The Good Friday Agreement marks a historic new beginning in relations within Northern Ireland, between the North and the South of the island and between Ireland and Britain. It has brought us all a new sense of hope. We have begun the long walk out of the dark night of division and conflict into the bright sunlight of partnership and harmony. As somebody who has spent almost 40 years in political life seeking to encourage such a journey, I am immensely gratified by this development. The Agreement is a complex document, a careful set of checks and balances, a parity of pain and gain. Striking that balance of pain and gain on both sides was, in large part, the task of the main political parties in Northern Ireland. Their decisions called for political courage and most serious and genuine leadership, which they gave in abundance. But they could not have been taken without trust and vision, too — trust, where before there was only suspicion, and vision, where before there had only been self-interest. The leadership of these peacemakers in Northern Ireland deserves the warmest commendation of this Assembly. With the participants drawn from the full spectrum of the political landscape, what we were addressing in the negotiations was a complex range of problems and perspectives, each with its deep roots in history. If these competing issues were to be addressed satisfactorily, we knew the final Agreement would itself have to be complex, broad-based and balanced. Achieving agreement in these circumstances was a major challenge for all of us involved in the long, tortuous and difficult negotiations. As one of those privileged to have had such a role, I can verify that there were times during the long days and nights in Castle Buildings, Belfast, when success seemed like some distant dream. But the determination of all sides not to be deflected was stronger than any obstacle. On the dawn of Good Friday, the dream of agreement finally became a reality. Critically, the Agreement was emphatically endorsed by the people of Ireland, North and South, in referendums held on the same day, the first time that has happened on the island of Ireland since 1918. One of the profound consequences of this democratic endorsement is that never again may the name of the people be invoked as a basis for the shedding of blood in my country and on my island. From now on, it is manifest that the only legitimate force is the force of reason and persuasion. The Good Friday Agreement is a blueprint for our future. Indeed, it may be a blueprint for other regions? futures. But a blueprint can be successful only if it is translated from word to deed. That vital process of implementation is the next great challenge and one that we are all now actively addressing. Some elements of the 39 Agreement are already in place. The new Northern Ireland Assembly has been elected and the 108 members have taken their seats. Dramatically symbolizing the new era of partnership, David Trimble and my good friend Seamus Mallon, each representing the two major traditions, have been appointed First Minister and Deputy First Minister, respectively. The Assembly has made an encouraging and constructive start. Work is also proceeding on many of the other elements of the Agreement. But institution-building alone, important as it is, will not be enough. The appalling atrocities of last summer, which saw the horrific burning to death of three young boys, the Quinn brothers, and the merciless massacre and slaughter of 29 people in Omagh underline the reality that the Agreement on its own does not guarantee peace. More than anything else, what is also required is what Seamus Mallon calls a new politics. At the heart of that new politics must be a determination to work in a new way for the wider good. All of us have constituencies to represent, but we must find new ways to balance that requirement with the needs of the wider society. That, I would suggest, is what partnership means. That, I would suggest, is what partnership is all about. It also shows how trust and reconciliation are built. If the new politics is to work on the island of Ireland, we must seek to develop, on the basis of mutual respect, new ways of listening to each other; new ways of talking to each other; new ways of understanding each other; and, critically, new ways of working together. We are bringing this century to a close. The existence of this great Organization of States devoted to peace reflects the turbulence of the decade. Great progress has been made, but a great price has also been paid. Each of us in our own way has had to grapple with the instinct to war and division. The experience of Ireland echoes the experiences of so many other States. We realized our desire for independence in the wake of the Great War. Our birth as a State was darkened by the horrors of civil war. We in the South of the island overcame our divisions, channelled our differences into peaceful politics and have significantly prospered. In the North, divisions and fears were not challenged. They festered and brought us almost three decades of violence. The peace process allowed us to challenge and resolve the fears and divisions generating the conflict. The Agreement is a watershed, a harbinger of the new era that coincides with the millennium. It is a great, historic rapprochement between nationalism and unionism. All the participants in the negotiations together have achieved a great thing. But it is vital that we say to one another, as I am now again saying to the unionist community, that we recognize that a new era has dawned, in which all the old shibboleths and the old rhetoric must be replaced by a new dialogue, by a new partnership. It is precisely in this spirit of the new politics that we must approach the inevitable difficulties that will arise from time to time, including at present those relating to the establishment of the “shadow” executive in Northern Ireland and to decommissioning. It is in the interests of all of us who support the Agreement that we resolve the difficulties to the satisfaction of all concerned. If one side “wins”, everybody loses. That was the approach that secured the Good Friday Agreement. If one side “wins”, everybody loses. I should like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the role of the international community in bringing about the Good Friday Agreement, in particular that of the independent chairman, former Senator George Mitchell of the United States of America, former Prime Minister Harri Holkeri of Finland and General John de Chastelain of Canada. Their contribution was immense, and General de Chastelain?s contribution continues to be. The support and solidarity, through the process of our partners in this Assembly, and, in particular, of our partners in the European Union — the President of the Commission and the Presidencies of the European Union — have been unparalleled in their contribution, as were the warm and encouraging words of the Secretary-General of this Organization. We deeply appreciate it. I want in particular to record our very special gratitude to the President of the United States, Mr. Bill Clinton, for his personal commitment to the cause of peace in Ireland and for the exceptional solidarity with the peace process he has displayed at all times throughout his presidency. He took the opportunity, when he addressed this Assembly last Monday, to mention Northern Ireland and Ireland on three or four or five occasions. I think that was an indication of the type of commitment he has and will continue to have in the Northern Ireland peace process. Finally, I would like to underline the central and crucial roles played by my own Taoiseach, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, and by British Prime Minister Tony Blair in the closing days of the negotiations. Their particular role was historic and, in my respectful view, heroic. 40 I want to say that, in the spirit of the Charter of this Organization, we are ready to reciprocate the solidarity of the international community by way of sharing the lessons of our experience with others, should that be considered helpful. It would be a source of immense additional satisfaction to Ireland, as a committed Member of the United Nations, if the Good Friday Agreement were to be helpful to conflict resolution elsewhere. Finally, and important though international solidarity may be, the reality is that for us in Ireland, as elsewhere, the primary responsibility rests with ourselves. May I recall here the words of a well-known author which have inspired very many: “Mankind must remember that peace is not God?s gift to his creatures; peace is our gift to each other.” With the Good Friday Agreement, we in Ireland have enjoyed the gift of peace. We do so in the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations. The challenge now is to ensure that it is passed to our children and to our children?s children. I know that the members of this Assembly will be with us as we address and take up that particular challenge.   A unanimous tribute has been paid to you, Sir, and, through you, to your country, Uruguay, by your election to the presidency at this session of the General Assembly. I am pleased to join in that tribute by congratulating you on this well-deserved distinction and wishing you all success in the discharge of your mission. I should also like to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Udovenko, who was able to meet our expectations in exemplary fashion at a time when our Organization was embarking on a course of reform. Mr. Kofi Annan has fully committed himself, with imagination and courage, to that same course of reform, and he has succeeded in making strides that call for our sincere expression of gratitude and recognition. That reform is now on the right course. It is meeting the collective expectations that have been expressed. But more than that, it comes at the right moment, just as new problems are arising to test our skills in diagnosing the new challenges and in formulating policies that are capable of responding to these challenges and aspirations. However new these problems may be, they are a natural consequence of humanity’s progress towards the fulfilment of its destiny. They have arisen out of the unprecedentedly swift changes that have taken place in international relations for a full decade. These problems have names. They present challenges that were heretofore unknown to us, and they demand solutions that go beyond our customary frameworks of thought, analysis and action. Let us first identify these problems by their names: globalization, interdependence, development, peace and collective security. These are but workshops which nourish our diverse debates and contradictory approaches. They raised certainties on the part of some and doubts and warnings on the part of others. Until now, the debate has been limited to exchanges of ideas, confined to the approaches or projections that each of us has formulated from our own perspectives, our own calculations and our own 20 national interests. Today, the facts themselves have been determined. It is incumbent upon us to confront what yesterday was nothing but conjecture and today is a living reality, in keeping with the principles and ideals of the United Nations which our countries embody. This is the case with globalization, which was long presented to us as being capable of ensuring universal prosperity, and to which was attributed the virtue of limitless growth. However, many of our countries have expressed their doubts, their warnings of the dislocations and dangers which would result from a globalization which lacks the least means of appropriate regulation, coordination and monitoring. In the absence of such instruments of regulation, coordination and monitoring, and given the acknowledged shortcomings of the existing mechanisms, globalization rightly gives rise more often to doubts and fears than to support and conviction. There is no better illustration of the tragic consequences which could result from those dislocations than the Asian crisis, the results of which are still unfolding, threatening the economies of many regions of the world to such a degree that the spectre of widespread recession has re-emerged. In fact, rather than being a force for integration, globalization has turned into a force for exclusion and marginalization. This state of affairs forces us to think collectively about how to reimbue globalization with its original and ideal purpose so that it can meet the aspirations placed in it for universal progress in justice and solidarity. Globalization represents a comprehensive challenge which must be met by comprehensive regulation, coordination and dialogue. Until then, the existing mechanisms must be strengthened in their assigned functions of prevention and interposition. Finally, regional integration as an integral component of a well-balanced and carefully monitored globalization, must be accompanied by bold and effective initiatives. The problem of interdependence is structurally linked to that of globalization. The arrival of an age of interdependence among nations has fed the great hope of creating and diversifying the bonds that are necessary for expanding the area of cooperation and exchange among our countries. However, the erosion of international cooperation for development, as well as the imbalances in the present system of world economic relations, still represent basic impediments on the road to crystallizing true interdependent relationships. At the core of the problem of globalization and interdependence is development — a crucial problem, which has not yet received the attention that is due to it. On the contrary, it is increasingly marginalized in our discussions today, as well as in the design of world economic policies. Finally, the problem of peace and collective security has encountered new challenges other than those with which it was identified before and which still exist till today. From this perspective, I speak of the phenomenon of terrorism. Terrorism has no respect for human life and is capable of perpetrating the most vile crimes against humankind. By its logic of terror, death and destruction, it seeks to strike at the foundations of every civilized society. For these reasons, terrorism is truly characterized as the most serious threat to our societies and the nations of the world as a whole. Terrorism is a global phenomenon which calls for a global response from the international community. Algeria is pleased to note that after having underestimated and incorrectly analysed terrorism for a long time, the international community increasingly seems to be more cognizant of its dangers and aware that the time has come to supplement unilateral and isolated action on the part of States fighting terrorism with collective and resolute action. With this perspective in mind, conditions are now right for us to go beyond mere verbal condemnation of terrorism to ensure that intentions and actions would really go hand in hand through effective international cooperation whose goal is to fight terrorism. The elimination of this scourge is no longer a mere moral obligation for humankind. It has also become a political necessity in an age of interdependence and globalization. For that reason Algeria believes that the time has come to give serious consideration to the preparation of a global convention to prevent and fight all acts of terrorism and to serve as a legal framework for the organization and implementation of international cooperation in that matter. Such a project should take shape as of now in the form of concerted and sustained action on the part of the entire international community to dismantle terrorism’s multifaceted support networks and rear bases, dry up its financial resources and bring to trial the perpetrators of terrorist acts and their accomplices and abettors. The convening of a world summit on terrorism, 21 which received broad support in this Assembly, would be a basic step in that direction. Algeria fully supports the idea of such a summit and stands completely ready to make its contribution to it. In view of Algeria’s belonging to several spheres — the Maghreb, the Mediterranean, the Arab and the African — it has constructed its foreign policy on the principles of openness, solidarity, good-neighbourliness and cooperation. Algeria embodies these principles in its immediate environment, the Maghreb, convinced that only a united Maghreb community would serve the cause of peace, stability and the development of the countries of our region. These same principles have moved Algeria to tireless support for a just and definitive solution to the conflict in Western Sahara. We fully support the United Nations settlement plan, in cooperation with the Organization of African Unity, which calls for the holding of a free, fair and impartial referendum on self-determination. Like the rest of the international community, Algeria welcomes the Houston accord, through which the two parties to the conflict, the Kingdom of Morocco and the POLISARIO front, solemnly agreed on the practical modalities for implementing the provisions of the settlement plan under the auspices of the United Nations. Today, one year after the conclusion of that accord, and despite the real, significant progress resulting, in large part, from the efforts of the Secretary-General, of his Personal Envoy Mr. James Baker, and of his Special Representative, serious obstacles still stand in the path to the plan’s implementation. If they are not overcome, these obstacles, which the Secretary-General has clearly identified in successive reports, along with their causes, could seriously compromise the chances of holding the long-awaited referendum. Therefore it is now necessary to solemnly and urgently appeal for full and strict respect for the commitments undertaken and to reaffirm the responsibility of the United Nations, in particular the Security Council, with regard to the full and strict implementation of the settlement plan and the Houston accord so as to ensure that the people of the Western Sahara can exercise their inalienable right to selfdetermination. As in the Maghreb, Algeria has been working in the Mediterranean to ensure that there will be an atmosphere of stability, peace, cooperation and prosperity. The machinery for consultation and cooperation that was set up through the Barcelona process has opened new horizons for the development of a true partnership between the two shores of that shared sea, a partnership directed towards developing a zone of shared prosperity in the Mediterranean. In this context, Algeria undertook negotiations on an agreement of association with the European Union aimed at putting in place the conditions necessary for renewed and mutually beneficial cooperation between the two parties. Within the same Mediterranean region, and after the launching of the peace process which raised great hopes, feelings of anxiety and pessimism have again returned since the peace mechanism has become stalemated. The Israeli Administration, by reneging on commitments made in Oslo and Washington, by abandoning the principle of land for peace, by continuing its settlement policy and by repeatedly attacking the integrity and sacredness of Al-Quds Al-Sharif, has led to the undermining of the peace process, rekindling the frustrations and anger of the Palestinian people and threatening the entire region with a return to the era of confrontation which prevailed there for more than 40 years. In order to deal with this perilous situation, we must recall that the just, comprehensive and lasting settlement to the conflict in the Middle East requires the full and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the Palestinian and occupied Arab territories and the exercise of the right of self-determination by the Palestinian people, including the establishment of its own State with Al-Quds as its capital. In the same part of the world, the suffering of the brotherly Iraqi people continues to dismay us. In this regard, we cannot but reiterate our call for the rapid lifting of the embargo on Iraq. Similarly, we renew the same call with regard to the brotherly Libyan people, who are also the victims of cruel economic sanctions, which we hope will be lifted soon, in view of the recent positive developments in the Lockerbie case. In its relations with its African neighbours, as in its relations with other African countries, Algeria has always worked to ensure that there will be strong bonds of cooperation and solidarity with a view to achieving the political and economic unification of the continent. Intrastate and inter-State conflicts in Africa can only damage this ambitious and legitimate project. We therefore call for the settlement of these conflicts and 22 crises by utilizing existing African mechanisms, particularly the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution, on the basis of respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of States and also the frontiers inherited from colonialization. For a decade Africa has been making profound political, economic and social reforms for which the international community must provide resolute and meaningful support, as the Secretary-General of our Organization called for in his comprehensive and thorough report. In less than two months the international community will be celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Such anniversaries provide a good opportunity for collective self-review, which impels us to acknowledge that in the field of human rights, the situation is certainly much better than it was 50 years ago. The people’s liberation movement and the global spread of democracy have certainly played a crucial role in promoting and consolidating human rights. There can be no doubt that the significant progress made in democratization and the establishment within the State of the rule of law will remain fragile and will be endangered unless they are accompanied by meeting the economic, social and cultural needs of the citizens. This is because true democracy cannot take root permanently and soundly in places of deprivation and want. In this connection and in the name of my country, I wish to reaffirm our strong attachment to the universality, interdependence and indivisibility of human rights and our resolute commitment to promote them free from any manipulation or politicization. If we wish to sum up these complex and multifarious challenges facing mankind today, this could be done through one essential question: how can we make sure that the evolving new world order will be more just and more secure, will have greater solidarity and will truly address the interests and aspirations of everyone? That is the question which, of course, involves our country, and through it, mankind as a whole. And what better forum to answer this question is there than the United Nations, which brings us together and through whose Charter we have proclaimed our determination “to practise tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours, and to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security, and ... to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples”. The challenges of the present are embodied in these basic values and these shared purposes. In fact, the primacy given to these values and the attainment of these purposes are contingent on our ability to mobilize our collective energies. Mankind, which has mastered science and technology, has achieved considerable progress in the utilization of the resources of our world and has established its control over the means of its progress. Now it has in its hands the keys to its destiny. Using the keys to its destiny for the common good depends on humankind, and on humankind alone. It is with great pleasure that I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your unanimous election to preside over the General Assembly at this session. This session is particularly significant because we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is also important for a less uplifting reason: during this session the international community is confronted with serious challenges and is hard pressed to find collective wisdom to deal with disturbing developments and trends. As you guide us in our deliberations on these issues, I wish you well and would like to extend to you the full support of my delegation. I also wish to join the preceding speakers, all of whom have justly praised the excellent work done by your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko. Our Secretary-General stated in his address to the recent summit of the Non-Aligned Movement that “human rights are not simply a matter of civil and political freedom. Genuine freedom of choice requires economic, social and cultural emancipation too.” From the very beginning of our development process and to ensure such emancipation, Bhutan has been guided by a philosophy of maintaining a harmonious balance between material and spiritual prosperity. This we believe is the way forward to attaining our goal of gross national happiness. I have the pleasure to inform the Assembly that the throne of the Kingdom of Bhutan has always been the fountainhead of the many changes in our country which have led to greater empowerment of the people. Just three months ago our King introduced, through the National Assembly, some profound changes in the governance of our country. These changes are in addition to the earlier institutionalization of participatory decision making processes at the district and grass-roots levels. Upon dissolution of the appointed Cabinet, a new Council of Ministers has been elected for a specific term by the National Assembly. His Majesty the King has voluntarily relinquished his role as the head of Government and was further successful in convincing the National Assembly to introduce a mechanism for the removal of a reigning monarch through a periodic vote of confidence. Such ongoing changes have further strengthened the rule of law and have enhanced even further the direct participation of the people in development and governance. 7 As we stand at the threshold of another millennium of human civilization, our generation of leaders and policy makers must not fail to grasp the unprecedented opportunities. Ours is the past and ours, too, is the future. Even as we are engaged in the last defining moments of the twentieth century, we have a decisive role in shaping the beginning of the next thousand years. We cannot undermine our own role. Narrow interests and differences must not be allowed to deter us from the greater legacy we owe to posterity. I believe that we should look upon all the challenges that have spiralled in recent years as a last reminder of the growing vulnerabilities of human society. There is the Asian crisis, which now threatens to cause global economic contraction and is already undermining the social and political stability of some nations. The environment is wreaking havoc in many quarters of the world, causing loss of life and property in both the richest and the poorest countries. And just as trade, technology and the reality of interdependence force us to abide with each other in a world that is shrinking in space and natural resources, we find ourselves torn apart by bigotry, intolerance and hate. Terrorism is on the rise, our children are lured by drugs and crime, and even the richest nations among us can ill afford the rising cost of growing prison populations. Then, there is the spectre of a nuclear holocaust, which continues to haunt us. Unless we look at our future and manage the compelling forces of globalization with a greater sense of spirituality and social concern, I fear that the global village will fail to provide much of that elusive state of joy and contentment to which we all aspire. Terrorism in all its manifestations is unjustifiable, regardless of the cause it seeks to espouse. It must be condemned in the strongest of terms. Those who use terror or the threat of terror target innocent people. Their objectives are clear: to foster an environment of fear if their goals are not met. Such heinous crimes against humanity must not go unpunished. The voices of those who live in constant fear of having the most fundamental of human rights — the right to live without fear and the right to life itself — abused and violated can no longer be ignored. The conclusion and effective implementation of a comprehensive international convention on terrorism therefore assumes great significance. The recent nuclear tests in South Asia have aroused much concern. However, we are heartened by the positive steps being taken by the concerned parties to calm the fears of the international community. As a small, peace-loving country, Bhutan has always condemned nuclear armament and advocated full and comprehensive elimination of all nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. Our delegation urges all participants in the disarmament processes to undertake a more realistic assessment of the prevailing global security arrangement, which, we believe, has the inherent weakness of enticing States to join an exclusive club. Unless there is an accelerated process towards complete and comprehensive denuclearization beyond the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and beyond the Comprehensive Nuclear- Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), the world must be prepared to face the eventuality of a nuclear club that will lose its exclusivity. Active and not passive interdependence is the primary condition for all human progress in the future. It is clear that prosperity in one part of the global village cannot be sustained when poverty prevails in the other. Yet unconscionable levels of disparity continue to grow between the rich and the poor countries. While one section of human society is burying itself in the waste of conspicuous and excessive consumption, the other is plagued by hunger and exposure. Against this backdrop, it is sad to note that shrinkage of official development assistance remains a serious concern. Political will must be generated to reverse this trend and to inject new vitality into international cooperation for development in the interest of shared and sustainable prosperity. Revitalization and reform of our Organization has been the singular underlying theme of recent sessions of the General Assembly. We are all agreed on the need for major changes if the United Nations is to effectively meet the current and emerging challenges of the twenty-first century. As we continue to assess the long-term implications of the Secretary-General’s proposal contained in his report, we should bear in mind the needs and aspirations of small and developing countries, which comprise the overwhelming majority of the United Nations membership. Efforts should also focus on further strengthening of the role and capacity of the Organization in the promotion of development. In this regard, we welcome the inter- agency collaborative arrangements, which we feel have already led to improved coordination and cost- effectiveness of the United Nations development agencies. In so saying, I should like to place on record the deep gratitude of the people of Bhutan for the vital role and 8 contributions of the various United Nations agencies in our country’s development efforts. These agencies often play a lead and coordinating role in such sectors of our national development programmes as health, education and infrastructure. Indeed, it is the face of the United Nations as a prime mover of development that the masses in many of our countries most appreciate and cherish. Differences in perspective have prevented us from arriving at a meaningful agreement on substantive issues concerning the reform of the Security Council. Sixty-five lengthy meetings held by the Open-ended Working Group on the question of Security Council expansion and reform have yielded few results, and tangible proposals remain elusive. My country firmly supports the position of the Non- Aligned Movement on this matter, as reiterated in the Final Document of its twelfth Summit meeting, which was convened in South Africa earlier this month. Bhutan is of the view that the current permanent members have an obligation to be more responsive to calls for multifaceted reforms of the Council. It must be rendered more effective and transparent through democratization and the enlargement of its membership, both in the permanent and non-permanent categories. New permanent members must include countries that have the capacity to share greater international responsibilities and reflect equitable geographical representation. We believe that Japan, whose apportionment of the United Nations regular budget will exceed 20 per cent by the year 2000, and India as a developing country which represents one sixth of humanity, are two countries that deserve permanent membership in the Security Council. We remain convinced that the presence of developing countries is all the more essential for the reason that they form the object of most actions of the Council. Before I conclude, my delegation wishes to express its deep sadness over the loss of human life and destruction of property and infrastructure in the aftermath of the worst ever floods in Bangladesh. While the people of Bangladesh battle against this cruel act of nature, the people of Bhutan are one with them and have extended to them some assistance. As a least developed country, Bangladesh does not have the resources to alleviate the suffering of its people and to put itself on the road to recovery and normalization. We are hopeful that the international community will respond promptly and generously to the appeal of the Prime Minister and the Government of Bangladesh.   I should like, Mr. President, to extend to you our very warm congratulations on your election to lead the business of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. Your election bears testimony to the very high esteem in which we hold you and your country. You can count on our unstinting support and cooperation during the year that lies ahead. Through you, Sir, permit me also to salute your very worthy predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, the former Foreign Minister of Ukraine, for the illustrious manner in which he led the General Assembly at its fifty-second session. In your address at the opening of this session, Mr. President, you challenged us to focus our attention on the major issues of our time. The list of issues that you provided was comprehensive, but I wish here to highlight only some of them — without passing judgment on their relative worth. The Secretary-General has submitted a report on causes of conflict in Africa at the request, last year, of the Security Council. It is an excellent report, for which the Secretary-General should be commended. The recent events in Lesotho, to a large measure, fit in with the Secretary-General?s diagnosis. Nothing could be closer to the truth than the Secretary-General?s observation that “Where there is insufficient accountability of leaders, lack of transparency in regimes, inadequate checks and balances, non-adherence to the rule of law, absence of peaceful means to change or replace leadership, or lack of respect for human rights, political control becomes excessively important, and the stakes become dangerously high”. (A/52/871, para. 12) Our recent experience in Lesotho is that instability is likely to arise even when Governments are deeply conscious of the need to abide by those prescriptions, if other political players are not similarly committed to them. On 23 May 1998, a general election was held in Lesotho under the management of an Independent Electoral Commission established with the full cooperation of all political parties. The Commission, a new institution in the history of Lesotho, was without previous experience. The elections were observed by 400 local and 150 international observers, including observers from the United Nations, all of whom declared them free and fair. Soon afterwards, however, three of the 12 opposition parties alleged that the Lesotho Congress for Democracy had won through fraud. Vice-President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa attempted to mediate in this dispute, and all the parties agreed to an audit of the 9 election results, conducted by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), in order to determine the existence or otherwise of fraud. The Commission of Investigation, which came to be known as the Langa Commission after its Chairman, Justice Pius Langa of South Africa, found that, while there had been administrative irregularities, there had been no fraud and the elections could not be said not to represent the will of the electorate. But even in the absence of fraud, the opposition parties still insisted on the resignation of the Government, the dissolution of Parliament and the establishment by the King of a government of national unity in which all the major parties would be equally represented. In an attempt to achieve this, the opposition parties perpetrated lawlessness, which resulted in an army mutiny, the forced and illegal dismissal of the command structure by junior officers, and open support by those junior officers for the opposition-led civil unrest in preparation for an illegal takeover of the Government. It was in this state of virtual coup d?état that the Lesotho Prime Minister appealed to the Presidents of Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe for military assistance to restore law and order and to enforce discipline in the Lesotho army. The responsibility was shouldered by the SADC member States Botswana and South Africa on behalf of the entire SADC. While these SADC troops were busy neutralizing the army mutiny and the virtual coup, the supporters of opposition parties embarked on a campaign of arson and looting in the central business district of the capital, Maseru, which later spread to other towns of the country. Although the full extent of the damage to business infrastructure is not yet known with certainty, preliminary estimates put it at above $200 million. For a small least developed country like Lesotho, such an amount is a heavy burden on an already fragile economy. The Government of Lesotho therefore appeals to the international community for assistance in rebuilding the infrastructure that has been so wantonly destroyed. We have already made contacts with the World Bank for a more precise assessment of our needs in this regard, and once these are known we shall be making a more focused appeal. Above and beyond the assistance with physical reconstruction, it is quite clear that the type of assistance which the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and some bilateral donors were giving to reorient the minds of our army has not yet had a lasting impact. Lesotho has had a sad history of an army that was deliberately filled with supporters of one political party when that party was in power for over 20 years. As a consequence, our army has had great difficulty in submitting to the authority of a new master. Recent events have underscored the urgent need to overhaul the Lesotho army, as was done under international supervision in Haiti. Furthermore, all political parties need to submit themselves to the discipline and responsibilities that are demanded of them as actors in the democratic system. This includes the acceptance of defeat in general elections. Otherwise, those politicians who deliberately undermine the democratic culture should be exposed and officially branded by the international community as criminals, as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) has done with Savimbi in Angola. Since 1993, Lesotho has been embarked on a programme of entrenching democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The current crisis has amply demonstrated how difficult it is to make people whose only preoccupation is the achievement of personal political power participate in this process. The Government of Lesotho is grateful for the support of the countries of SADC in once again reversing a coup in Lesotho. SADC has given practical expression to what has become an all-Africa commitment to the abhorrence of military overthrow of legitimate Governments, such as occurred recently in Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The extent of recent lawlessness in Lesotho has underscored the need to control the illicit possession of small arms and light weapons. In Lesotho recently, young people, many of them in their teens, were able to intimidate law-abiding citizens with guns and to force them to surrender Government property and to evacuate Government offices and private industrial enterprises. Small arms and light weapons have become so commonplace that they have encouraged habitual recourse to violence, thus threatening the cohesion and well-being of many societies. These low-tech, inexpensive and easy to use weapons — numbering hundreds of millions — cause as much as 90 per cent of the deaths in contemporary conflicts. Their proliferation contributes to violence, loss of life and property, social instability, the disruption of economic development and the threat to democratic governance. 10 During the cold war, arms control and disarmament efforts focused exclusively on major weapons systems, such as tanks, jet fighters and nuclear weapons. Although this has begun to change in recent years, there are still no international standards regarding small arms. Their production, trade and possession remain essentially unmonitored and unregulated. Lesotho therefore strongly supports current efforts to find an international solution to these problems posed by the unregulated proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons. The Government of Lesotho is understandably disappointed that its efforts to build and consolidate a culture of democratic governance seem to have suffered a setback, especially this year, when we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, Lesotho will not be deflected from the path it has chosen of moving forward to truly democratic governance in which all citizens enjoy their right to political freedom and personal happiness. Fifty years ago, the peoples of the world set down standards for their security, happiness and well-being in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In the intervening period, the international community and the United Nations have made great strides in the area of human rights. Of great significance are the major human rights treaties which have been adopted and which include the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The battle to make human rights truly universal has regrettably not been won decisively, although there is no doubt that we are on the way to achieving that goal. We therefore need to redouble our efforts to pursue it. In the post-cold-war era, attention has unfortunately been focused almost exclusively on civil and political rights, with less attention being paid to economic, social and cultural rights. That development is a human right is often forgotten. Such a narrow approach misses the important link that exists between the enjoyment of civil and political rights and development. The Declaration on the Right to Development was intended to emphasize such a link but, regrettably, this latest of recognized rights has yet to be factored into our human rights programmes. As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, no topic is of greater significance than the establishment of a permanent International Criminal Court. Over 50 years ago, this idea was conceived out of the realization that domestic courts are often inadequate to deter crimes under international law, resulting in impunity for perpetrators of human rights abuses. The adoption of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court less than three months ago was the culmination of a long battle fought by courageous men and women for justice. The Statute is therefore our proud bequest to future generations. Over the years of negotiation on the Rome Statute, Lesotho always affirmed the need for a court in which we could have faith: an effective, independent and impartial Court that enjoyed universal acceptance. In order to achieve this, a number of thorny and sensitive issues had to be resolved over the five-week period of the Rome Conference. While not everything that we had hoped for has been included in the Statute, we believe that the positive aspects of the Statute far outweigh its negative elements. If, in the years ahead, there is to be greater respect for international law and international humanitarian law, all States will have to take the International Criminal Court seriously and adopt measures to ensure the coming into operation of the court without delay. We thus urge the Secretary-General to convene the Preparatory Commission in early 1999 to begin work on the rules of procedure and evidence, guidelines for the court on the elements of crimes, the headquarters agreement and other instruments. We also call upon the Assembly to endorse the Rome Statute and urge States to ratify it in sufficient numbers so that the court can start its work. Lesotho remains ready to work towards the accomplishment of these tasks. During the current session of the General Assembly and the twelfth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, recently held in Durban, South Africa, the concern of the international community has focused on the phenomenon of globalization, an issue of particular importance for the least developed countries. The liberalization of trade regimes and the promotion of an open and secure multilateral trading system are central requirements for the promotion of economic development. While the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations has resulted in significant improvements in market access conditions for the majority of countries of the world, the expected gains for the least developed countries from the stimulus to world trade arising from the Uruguay Round are less clear. These countries continue to face significant obstacles to market access for their exports. There are still tariff peaks and tariff escalations against their major export items. Furthermore, 11 some standards are too difficult to meet due to the differences in technological advancement. The problems enumerated above attest to the importance of the United Nations in shaping a world of peace, prosperity and development. A question that has plagued the United Nations since its founding has been that of disarmament, and in particular nuclear disarmament. Nuclear weapons pose a serious threat to all humanity and its habitat, yet they remain in the arsenals built up during the height of the cold war. Their time has passed, yet assertions of their utility continue. Nuclear weapons are held by a handful of States which insist that these weapons provide security benefits, and yet reserve uniquely to themselves the right to own them. This situation is highly discriminatory, unstable and untenable. The possession of nuclear weapons by any State is a constant stimulus to other States to acquire them. For these reasons, it is a central reality that nuclear weapons diminish the security of all States. The recent testing of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan was a self-fulfilling prophecy. As much as we deplore the measures taken by these two countries, we must not lose sight of the fact that they have been led down that path by the resistance of nuclear-weapons States to fulfil their obligations towards negotiating in good faith for a total ban of all nuclear weapons. We call upon all nuclear- weapons States to respond to the wishes of all humanity to ban nuclear weapons from human experience by negotiating a binding treaty for such a ban. Lesotho supports the efforts of the Secretary-General towards reforming the United Nations Organization. There is general agreement that the Security Council must be made more democratic and its working methods more transparent. For the great majority of States, the United Nations is an indispensable tool for the realization of our dream for collective security and development. We are therefore troubled that the efforts to reform the Organization are bogged down in the most crucial area, namely, the reform of the Security Council. The Charter has conferred on that organ the most important responsibility for international peace and security. The Working Group on Security Council reform has been working for almost five years without reaching a conclusion. The time has now come for a negotiating text to be prepared and for negotiations to commence. Otherwise, the whole exercise will turn into a charade in which all will lose interest. The scourge of conflicts in Africa continues to undermine efforts towards economic and social development in that continent. Lesotho is deeply concerned by the failure of UNITA to comply with the agreed timetable for the resolution of the conflict in Angola, in accordance with the provisions of the Lusaka Protocol and the relevant Security Council resolutions. We thus call on the international community, and the Security Council in particular, to assume its responsibility to apply firmly and resolutely the measures decreed by the Council, especially within the context of resolutions 1135 (1997) and 1173 (1998). Lesotho, as a member of SADC, supports the resolution of the recent SADC summit in Mauritius, which held Mr. Savimbi accountable for the resumption of hostilities in that country and thus declared him a political criminal. The situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is another source of concern to the Government of Lesotho. This situation has seriously jeopardized efforts at consolidating peace, security and stability in the Great Lakes region. Lesotho supports all efforts aimed at promoting a climate of peace and security in that region, including the SADC initiative as carried out by Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola. Finally, we remain disappointed by the slow pace of efforts at finding a lasting solution to the long-running problem of Western Sahara. We therefore appeal to all parties concerned to respect and commit themselves to the letter and spirit of the United Nations settlement plan, within the context of the Houston accord, so that the people of Western Sahara can at last join the rest of the international community as a peaceful, democratic and stable society as we move across the threshold of the next millennium.  It gives me great pleasure at the outset, Sir, to extend to Mr. Opertti my sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. We are confident that his political perspicacity and wide knowledge of international affairs will guarantee the success of the work of this Assembly. His election is an acknowledgement by the international community of the active role that his friendly country, Uruguay, is playing at both the regional and the international level for the establishment and enhancement of cooperation between peoples and the consecration of the universal principles of peace and justice. I should also like to extend to his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, my warmest thanks and appreciation for the competence and dedication he demonstrated in discharging his responsibility in order to strengthen the foundations of change and structural reform of our international Organization so as to enable it to enter the next century with the necessary efficiency and effectiveness. I also wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his continuous and dedicated efforts to strengthen and restructure the Organization and for his eagerness to bolster international peace and security and the peaceful settlement of conflicts. The last decade of the twentieth century has been characterized by fiftieth anniversary celebrations commemorating the creation of many international institutions, including the United Nations. As the international community moves towards the twenty-first century, it is called upon to evaluate its accomplishments 20 in giving effect to the principles and goals of the United Nations and in delineating the contours of the future with a view to ensuring security, peace and development for all the peoples of the world. In this regard, ensuring a better world for future generations — a world in which security, justice, stability and prosperity for all prevail — remains the highest common goal, whose achievement requires efforts by all. This requires the international community to show an unwavering determination and to sustain efforts to establish a world order, built by all States, consolidating the objectives and principles of the United Nations and fulfilling the spirit and the letter of the Charter, on the basis of international legitimacy and the principles of democracy, equality and equity among States. The new approach adopted by the international community in the process of reform, which covers all United Nations structures and fields of activity, offers an opportunity for consolidating the principle of democracy as a basis for international relations. In this connection, Tunisia attaches great importance to strengthening the role and prerogatives of the General Assembly in all the areas of its competence as provided for in the Charter of the United Nations, particularly with regard to the development and maintenance of international peace and security. We wish to emphasize once again the need to revitalize and enhance the role of the General Assembly, given its universality, representativeness and democratic character. Strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency of the General Assembly should go hand in hand with the reform of the Security Council so as to confirm the principles of transparency, pluralism and democracy. These are values which should prevail in international relations and guide the activities of our Organization and its various bodies, including the Security Council, in order to enhance and develop its role in the maintenance of international peace and security, which, in recent years, has become increasingly important. Just as we expect the Security Council to act effectively and to fulfil its mission in the best way possible, we also stress the need to give that body a globally representative character that takes into account the interests of developing countries and reflects the reality of the world following the end of the cold war by expanding its membership to include all regional groups. In this respect, we stress our support for the request of the Group of African States, reaffirmed at the Ouagadougou summit, which calls for the allocation of two permanent seats to be occupied on a rotational basis by States from Africa, with the enjoyment of the same privileges as those of the current holders of permanent seats. However, the process of Security Council reform should not be limited to restructuring that body. The rationalization of the Council’s working methods is needed so as to strengthen and consolidate one of the Charter’s most important principles, that of compliance with and respect for international legitimacy by all. In this connection, we emphasize the need to review the veto right, whose use should be confined to the areas covered by Chapter VII of the Charter. We also believe that the sanctions regime practised by the Security Council should be reviewed to ensure the protection of populations, prevent their suffering and guarantee their right to development and to a life of dignity, and take into account the interests of neighbouring countries which have economic and commercial relations with the country targeted for sanctions. A specified time-frame should also be set up for the implementation and lifting of sanctions. In this connection, we stress the necessity of respecting Iraq’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and of implementing the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, including those resolutions dealing with Kuwaiti prisoners and missing persons. As we pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his efforts to contain the crisis between Iraq and the United Nations Special Commission, we call upon him to increase his efforts and to undertake the required initiative for a comprehensive review of the situation with a view to finding a solution acceptable to all parties which would accelerate the lifting of the sanctions imposed on the brotherly Iraqi people. Regarding the Lockerbie issue, Tunisia has expressed optimism over the recent developments, which could accelerate the achievement of a just and satisfactory settlement of this issue, taking into account the willingness demonstrated by the brotherly country of Libya and other concerned parties to deal in a positive manner with the ideas already put forward. We encourage all parties to move ahead in that direction so that the embargo imposed on the brotherly Libyan people can be lifted. With respect to the Middle East peace process, Tunisia has since the very beginning supported and worked relentlessly for its success. We wish once again 21 to express our deep concern about the present status of the process. We warned that setbacks and deadlocks would result from Israel’s continued policy of fait accompli and its refusal to honour its commitments and to implement the agreements that were concluded. We believe that it will not be possible to reach a just, comprehensive and lasting solution to the Middle East question without Israel’s compliance with international legitimacy represented by the relevant United Nations resolutions and based on the principles outlined in the Madrid process, particularly that of “land for peace”. Tunisia, which supports the just Palestinian cause, welcomes the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its last session enhancing the status of Palestine as observer at the United Nations. We hope that this step will soon be followed by international recognition of an independent Palestinian State with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital. Increased efforts by the international community to consolidate democratic relations among States and to strengthen international legitimacy in the conduct of world affairs are imperative for the foundation of a balanced international order that guarantees a better life for future generations and promotes conditions of stability in the security, economic and social dimensions. With regard to security, many regions of the world continue to be torn by war and conflicts, and their populations still endure suffering and tragedies due to the absence of stability and security. In our view, the best solution to these problems is to pre-empt crises through preventive diplomacy so as to eliminate their causes in the fastest and most effective way. The international community has successfully adopted this right approach and has been able to contain a number of conflicts through mediation, good offices and other peaceful means. The United Nations has also achieved considerable successes in the context of peacekeeping operations in many parts of the world, enabling it to contain conflicts either by interposing itself between the belligerents or by supervising the conclusion of peace agreements or by following up on their implementation. In addition, the United Nations has intensified cooperation with regional organizations within the framework of respect for the national sovereignty and political independence of States, and non-interference in their internal affairs. Nevertheless, these efforts remain insufficient, given the challenges that persist in many regions of the world, in particular, the African continent. Africa continues to face difficulties and diverse problems which are increasing its burden and hindering its efforts to achieve stability and development. In this respect, Tunisia has welcomed the Security Council’s initiative regarding the situation in Africa. We believe that the Secretary-General’s report in this regard was well timed, expressing concern about the situation and offering help to the African continent to find solutions capable of enhancing its security and development. We hope that this orientation will be confirmed by continued United Nations support for the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution of the Organization of African Unity through adoption of practical measures designed to help the integration of African States in the world economy. We believe that a lasting peace can be established only through total dismantling weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, whose formidable arsenals constitute a continued threat to humanity. It has become clear that the current nuclear non-proliferation regime cannot by itself eliminate the danger that the arms race poses to humanity with its ominous implications. Therefore it has become imperative that the international community increase its efforts to adopt practical measures aiming at eliminating all weapons of mass destruction, without exception, and banning their proliferation and stockpiling. While working towards that objective, the international community should strenuously endeavour to ensure the safety of non-nuclear States and to prohibit the use and the threat of the use of nuclear weapons against the sovereignty, territorial integrity and peoples of those States. We also emphasize the need for creating nuclear- weapon-free zones so as to put an end to continued threats to the security of countries and to open new vistas for the establishment of peace, security and stability throughout the world. In this context, Tunisia calls for the urgent creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, considering that all the countries of the region except Israel have adhered to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. With regard to conventional weapons, we express our satisfaction at the signing at Ottawa of the 22 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. Tunisia hastened to sign that Convention, believing that an end should be put to the great suffering that unarmed civilians are enduring because of these weapons. Hence, the necessary legal measures are being taken for Tunisia’s ratification of the Convention. We believe that peace and security cannot be established in the world without achieving economic and social development and ensuring conditions of well-being and dignified living for all peoples. Meeting the major challenges confronting developing countries starts with the establishment of a world economic order founded on equality and solidarity so as to enable developing countries to be integrated in the world economy and to attract the required flow of capital and direct investment needed to support their development efforts. The financial crisis that certain developing countries are experiencing confirms our belief that the economic globalization in which we have placed high hopes has, despite its positive aspects, negative repercussions on the world economy, particularly on the stability of the economies of developing countries. We call upon the international community and all United Nations agencies, in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions, to speed up taking the necessary measures that will overcome the negative aspects of globalization. Therefore, we support the search for effective multilateral mechanisms to control international capital flows and monetary fluctuations in order to ensure fair competition and to organize financial transactions on sound and solid bases. In this context, my country supports the initiative taken by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries to establish a high-level mechanism of consultation between the Movement and the Group of Eight most industrialized countries. We also believe that in the absence of a radical solution to the debt problem, efforts to liberalize the economies of developing countries will remain insufficient. In this regard, I would like to recall the proposal made by Mr. Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, President of the Republic of Tunisia, with respect to finding a solution to the problem of external debt by applying those debts to the implementation of environmental, social and other priority projects in developing countries. Working for the adjustment of the globalization process is not, in our opinion, limited to the pivotal role played by international organizations and financial institutions. Increasing efforts at the national and regional levels are also needed. In this context, Tunisia has striven to make its financial structures more efficient and to strengthen the factors of sustainable development through concentrating on the enhancement of human energies, establishing the state of law and institutions, protecting human rights and public freedom and strengthening democracy, which is based on the participation of civil society with all its components in decision-making. Aware of the importance of economic and geographic groupings in advancing the economies of developing countries, promoting man and facing the challenges of globalization, Tunisia has adopted a comprehensive strategy that reconciles the imperatives of security and the requirements of cooperation with economic complementarity and solidarity among States. That strategy is also based on strengthening the Maghreb area, establishing partnership with the European Union through the creation of a free trade zone and consolidating its relations with all countries, particularly those of Africa. The international conferences which have been held in recent years, particularly the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights, the Beijing Conference on Women and the Copenhagen World Summit on Social Development, have enabled the international community to develop coherent plans of action, addressing many social problems which still hinder the progress, the stability and the security of peoples. Tunisia calls for increased efforts to ensure full implementation and genuine follow-up of the decisions, recommendations and plans of action adopted by those conferences and for the necessary measures to apply them. While we recognize the responsibility of States in implementing economic policies which ensure the right of their citizens to development, we also emphasize the need to establish equitable international economic relations which take into account the right of all countries, particularly developing countries, to comprehensive and sustainable development. We also call upon United Nations organs, funds, programmes and specialized agencies to shoulder their responsibilities and help developing countries carry out their economic programmes. 23 The continued shrinkage of resources allocated for United Nations economic and social activities is a matter of concern to us. Therefore, we call again for the implementation of General Assembly resolutions stressing the need to provide additional funds for development. We also urge the international community, and particularly rich countries, to honour their commitments so as to give impetus to their efforts in the area of economic and social development. The year 1998 marks the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This coincides with the start of the evaluation of the follow-up of the recommendations adopted at the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights. We believe that the international community should take this ideal opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to promoting and protecting human rights as well as to develop a clear plan in this regard for the future. Tunisia takes note with satisfaction of the pioneering role played by the United Nations in promoting human rights, a matter which is in the forefront of its priorities, in accordance with an approach based on a comprehensive and coherent vision of those rights. Tunisia has contributed to the formulation of that approach. Nevertheless, we feel that these achievements are not enough. Poverty and exclusion continue to disrupt social stability in many countries. These are phenomena which also threaten the gains made in the field of human rights and constitute challenges which should be met with the required efficiency and effectiveness. The international community should, in our opinion, confirm the values of tolerance and disseminate them as a basic platform for promoting human rights and deepening the culture of human rights among societies throughout the world. We also emphasize that great importance should be given to the right to development and the need to remove all obstacles to the effective exercise of that right. In implementing its social and economic policy, Tunisia has adopted a comprehensive and integrated strategy aimed at the advancement of human beings. It has worked to honour all the commitments it has made by adhering to human rights conventions. At the initiative of the President of the Republic, many amendments to enact legislation have been introduced with a view to strengthening democracy and pluralism, promoting and safeguarding human rights, disseminating the culture of human rights, strengthening national institutions and mechanisms working in this field and protecting individual and group liberties as well as the rights of women and the child. In the area of social and economic development, Tunisia has increased its efforts to ensure a dignified life for members of all social sectors. It has focused its policy in this field on the enhancement of social integration, the struggle against poverty and the promotion of employment for all. In formulating its policy, Tunisia has been eager to involve all components of civil society in defining a comprehensive strategy and in taking necessary measures to carry out programmes of economic and social development. Social solidarity is one of the pillars of Tunisia’s policy in combating poverty and all forms of exclusion. The National Solidarity Fund, set up in 1992 at the initiative of the President of the Republic and subsequently reinforced by the creation of the Tunisian Solidarity Bank, has provided funds for many projects for low-income groups and has made possible the integration of underprivileged regions into the national economy. With respect to the consolidation of its employment policy, Tunisia recently formulated a comprehensive strategy manifested in the adoption of a national declaration on employment. That declaration was drafted following broad consultations in which all the country’s active forces took part; this was signed by all of our political parties, trade unions and professional associations. Tunisia’s approach to the formulation and implementation of its economic and social policy is based on the conviction that the phenomena of exclusion, marginalization and social discrimination create threats to the very foundations of stability and security, which are essential for the progress and prosperity of peoples. The struggle against those phenomena is the most appropriate means for eradicating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, organized crime and drug-trafficking. In that connection, we once again urge the international community to increase its efforts to combat terrorism by setting up a global strategy and taking the necessary legal measures to contain and uproot that phenomenon. Increased international awareness of the great danger of the drug phenomenon, which was illustrated in the convening of a special session of the General Assembly in June 1998 on the common struggle against drugs, 24 encourages us to support the efforts being made by the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to formulate a draft United Nations framework convention against organized crime. We hope that these efforts will succeed, for the international community is in urgent need of such an instrument. In the same context, Tunisia welcomes the recommendations of the World Conference of Ministers Responsible for Youth, held recently in Lisbon, and stresses the need to ensure that the implementation of the decisions taken at that conference is followed up. This will allow us to deal with the concerns of young people, develop their sense of responsibility and properly prepare them to assume the responsibility of managing tomorrow’s world. The Diplomatic Conference held at Rome in June and July 1998 on the creation of the International Criminal Court and the extensive participation of Member States and non-governmental organizations in that Conference, testify to the great importance we all accord to the creation of such a court, whose task will be to deal with heinous crimes against humanity and to punish their perpetrators. Tunisia participated in the Conference and voted in favour of the statute of the Court. While expressing satisfaction at the agreement reached on the creation of the Court, we would like to stress once again the importance of ensuring its independence and neutrality. Given the need to respect the principle of national sovereignty, Tunisia supports the consensus reached on the complementary character of the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and on the need to accord priority to national legal systems, which should retain the initiative of prosecution. We look forward to the advent of the new century with high hopes, and we call upon all States to evaluate what we have achieved so as to pursue joint action, to confront remaining challenges and to spare humanity from suffering like that which it has endured throughout the current century. This is a task that requires firm political will from all of us in order to meet the aspirations of our peoples to security, stability, growth and cooperation. Our devotion to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, the consolidation of international legality and democratic practice among nations, and the implementation of the process of the reform of the United Nations system to serve those principles and goals are undoubtedly the best means by which to lay the foundations of a better world, a world which we shall shape and build together for future generations.“To be or not to be.” Never before has Shakespeare?s famous dilemma been so valid. Half the world is shuddering with the collapse of the stock exchanges, from Tokyo to Rio, from Moscow to Buenos Aires, from London to Johannesburg, and even right here in New York. We, the other half, are also shuddering, not because of stock exchanges and securities that we do not possess, but because the entire burden of the global financial crash falls mercilessly on us, and nobody, absolutely nobody, is safe. The long-predicted Armageddon has arrived, and not just in a Hollywood movie. The huge global trap that our increasingly distressed planet has become does not issue licences for survival to countries or businesses. It does not provide protection from acid rain or the impacts of El Niño, nor does it abide by or believe in ideologies and cultures. It does not offer life jackets to speculators or mega-owners. As in the times of slavery, human beings have become mere commodities, engrossed in buying and selling each other instead of learning how to enjoy and defend their rights, while poisonous luxuries, the enemies of liberty, corrupt individuals and societies and deprive entire peoples of their national identity. The inevitable globalization that we should have reached through fraternity, solidarity and cooperation has come upon us in such neoliberalized form that the liberal economic thinking that gave rise to it cannot even be recognized in this new dogma. 34 The process of globalization and neoliberal internationalization of the world economy has today multiplied the advantages for developed countries to the detriment of the increasingly underdeveloped economies. This makes them more vulnerable to external factors beyond their control, such as the excruciating burden of foreign debt, increasingly unequal rates of exchange, the widening technological gap and the persistent decline in the price of commodities, in the context of a ruthless, speculative and hopelessly inhuman market. The inequitable trade relationship between rich and poor, more akin to theft or swindle than trade, is a basic element that explains this. According to International Monetary Fund (IMF) data only 0.2 per cent annual growth rate has been seen in non-fuel commodities between 1989 and 1998, while manufactured products grew at a rate of 0.9 per cent. How could economies whose terms of trade deteriorated, during that same period, at an annual rate of 0.4 per cent and whose currencies were severely devaluated be expected to grow? The excruciating weight of foreign indebtedness — a phenomenon that has become eternal with the increase of inequitable trade — rose from $1.118 trillion in 1989 to $1.875 trillion in 1998, for an annual average increase of 6 per cent. What counts is money and finance, not development or human well-being. Neoliberal globalization and some of its basic components, such as the liberalization of trade and free competition, do not in themselves mean that there will be an acceleration of economic growth or development in underdeveloped countries. At the same time, unrestrained deregulation and privatization have removed from the agenda the required protection for goods, services and workers in the third world. Unfair equal treatment is being granted to economies that by their very nature, characteristics and volume are unequal. Tariff barriers are being replaced with more subtle and politically optional methods of protectionism, while a club of selected owners, transnational corporations and Governments negotiate, behind the backs of the vast majority, a multilateral investment agreement that gives the definitive seal of approval to subservience and exclusion. There is no need for any special telescope to find the famous black holes that swallow stars in outer space. The worst black hole of them all can be found right here on Earth, right before our very eyes, where there was first a gap and then an abyss, where the wealth of the rich grew in step with the poverty of the poor. International cooperation and official aid for development, funnelled through different organizations of the United Nations system, are tending to decrease, considerably affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the system?s work in the field of development. Even worse, we see attempts to further condition such aid to political demands that injure national States and undermine the sovereignty of countries and peoples. Furthermore, such attempts erode the authority of Governments by determining their development policies, which directly affects democratic governance. They also bring about the resurgence of diseases that we thought had been eradicated, generating high mortality rates and premature aging of the world population. These are so illegitimate that no one should support them. We, the victims, cannot be expected think as our victimizers do. As Comrade Fidel Castro said only a few weeks ago at the twelfth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, “it is not possible to acquiesce in a world order which embodies to the utmost the highest principles and purposes of a system that for centuries colonized, enslaved and plundered us all”. Because these nations are so disunited, we have not been able to elude the ravages of neoliberal globalization, which is so alien in spirit to the groundbreaking Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen and contrary to the very letter of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which in a few weeks will be 50 years old. Against all logic, it is in our meetings, committees and other forums that the prerogatives to which we are entitled as human beings are being reduced to mere caricatures in an insane race to alter the very foundations of international law. We are constantly asked why we so stubbornly call for the genuine democratization of the United Nations and for far-reaching reform of its institutions. What does it take to understand that, when we are on the verge of bidding farewell to the second millennium, the world can no longer be forced to follow Bretton Woods norms, patterns and schemes that are consistent with a world order born out of a war and that are now obsolete. 35 The Dow Jones average sways and plummets just a few blocks away from this building. Uncertainty and hopelessness are rampant in the markets. Countries are going bankrupt — and so are their Governments. Hundreds of millions die of famine, disease, violence, terror and war. Some even become living dead, as they are deprived of their national identity. But we are expected to accept that here in the General Assembly those who unleashed this madness are destroying the only truly democratic space where we can act together. How much longer are we going to allow them to continue imposing conditions, unilaterally launching missiles, improving their nuclear arsenals and testing new “smart weapons”, while they demand disarmament from the poor and the illiterate? And further, they are preventing us from doing away with the dictatorship of a Security Council which refuses to expand or to give up or modify the power of veto? There can be no talk of a Security Council that provides legitimacy, let alone security, so long as that body fails to abide by the powers conferred upon it in Article XXIV of the Charter; so long as it ignores the powers of other United Nations bodies; so long as its composition remains inequitable; so long as each and every member does not enjoy identical rights; so long as we in the third world, the overwhelming majority of the world?s population, are not duly represented. For Cuba, the one steadfast and sincere thing to do is to alert the world to which we belong, and to struggle for the values of freedom, justice, dignity and humanitarianism that we believe in and uphold. These are the values that should prevail for the sake of our endangered human species. It is for this end that the resources made available to the United Nations by its Member States should be used. Enough of politicizing budgets under the pretext of alleged cost-effectiveness — as if the millions of African children dying of curable diseases, the millions of illiterate people in Latin America, or the millions of people displaced by conflicts in Asia and the Middle East were bolts of cloth, raw materials or spent fuel. Enough of the appalling facts cited in the latest Human Development Report, issued two weeks ago, which affirms that the barest consumption needs of over a billion people are not being met at all, and that more than 4 billion people lack essential health services and 2 billion suffer from anaemia, including 55 million in industrialized countries. Enough of accepting that the indicators of human consumption in 70 countries have dropped below the levels of 25 years ago. Enough of accepting that a child born in a developed country will consume and pollute in his or her lifetime as much as 50 children born in an underdeveloped country. Enough of accepting that three individuals in this world have amassed fortunes equivalent to the total gross domestic product of 48 States. Enough of accepting that the most powerful and wealthy nation on Earth, with the highest per capita income, should, according to the report, have the highest rates of human poverty. Enough of demagogy. Let us make way for ethics, generosity and humanitarianism. Let the debts be paid and the current scale of assessments maintained. Let us put an end to special United Nations peacekeeping operations and to the arms market they have generated, and let us strengthen the actions of the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children?s Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Development Programme, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the many other agencies that have truly endeavoured throughout their existence to assert the rights of every human being. That is the only really fair, responsible and humane thing to do. In other words, let us not allow so many children to die in the next few hours, days, months and years — such as the 108,217 infants under five years of age, who have died of preventable causes in the underdeveloped world since we opened the fifty-third session last Monday, without the Assembly or the international community of nations being able to do anything about it. Let us keep the voice and mandate of the peoples and Governments that make up the United Nations from being drowned out by the inhumane interests of the masters and their partners grouped in the “Washington consensus”, which is how chaste, scholarly jargon currently defines the alliance of countries and international financial institutions that have dragged us all into disastrous unipolar neoliberalization ruled by a unique and criminal way of thinking which hypocritically boasts of being pluralistic. 36 Let us prevent heinous and disgusting phenomena such as terrorism from being fostered in that way; both the terrorism that constantly takes innocent lives — which many seek to compare with the fight of other peoples that have employed humanitarian and worthy methods in their resort to weapons in order to win their rights — and the other much more sophisticated, computerized and globalized terrorism that turns the economy, politics and ideas into a lethal weapon to secure the interests of a restricted circle of selfish people who believe it is their prerogative to unilaterally impose their laws and their punishments on others. We recognize that drafting and implementing international treaties are instrumental in our struggle against terrorism. But if we are truly committed to achieving that goal, then the power to investigate, prevent and punish these acts must be assumed seriously by States as an obligation which may not be delegated. There must be genuine cooperation to apprehend perpetrators, and States must prevent by all means possible terrorist acts against other States being organized, encouraged, funded or tolerated within their territory. Cuba, which has suffered from terrorism and to which nothing that is human is alien, cannot but unequivocally condemn such actions, methods and practices. Above all, we denounce those responsible for fomenting, supporting, funding, masterminding, propagating or tolerating these loathsome actions, which, as recent events have illustrated, turn their perpetrators into heinous Saturns, capable of devouring their own children. For almost 40 years our homeland has had to defend itself from aggression and harassment of all kinds: dirty war, mercenary invasions, nuclear threat, veritable hunts organized in attempts to murder our main leaders, pirate attacks, constant acts of sabotage against our industry, our agriculture and our economy, blowing up of airliners in flight — as occurred in Barbados on 6 October 1976; over a thousand hours a week of subversive radio and television transmissions which illegally invade our radio-electronic space; and biological warfare. Our tourist facilities have endured terrorist attacks, employing Central American mercenaries, organized and financed from the United States, with the full awareness and tolerance of the authorities of that country. Furthermore, we are also currently facing further American criminal legislation aimed at intensifying the dirtiest and longest economic war ever perpetrated against any country. This is why we can speak about these issues with absolute morality. I must say at least a few words about recent accusations by the United States of alleged Cuban espionage activities in Florida, which have been widely disseminated by the mass media as something extraordinary. I am sure the Assembly understands that the most ridiculous and laughable thing to occur in recent days in this nation of scandals is that the world?s biggest spy, the United States, has accused of espionage the world?s most spied upon country, Cuba. The reality we live in is not recognized in the current Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Nobody denies that this is a document of universal scope, the outcome of the most progressive thinking of its time and the international culmination of certain trends and values that emerged from the horrors of the Second World War. However, it should not be forgotten that when we embraced it in 1948 almost two thirds of humanity still lived under the colonial and neo-colonial yoke. All those countries had been reduced to mere objects of international law. For them, the most traumatic experience was not the war but underdevelopment, political exclusion and the new and even more catastrophic economic battles imposed upon them. While we uphold the values of our 50-year-old Declaration, values which cannot be renounced, and reject attempts to cause confusion over it and give it an ideological and political nature, we must have the courage and awareness to recognize its historical and conceptual limitations, which illustrate that the time has come to draft a new international charter of human rights capable of meeting the requirements of the new millennium. If we do not do this now, what will be the use of all the efforts made five years ago at the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights to adopt a Declaration and a Programme of Action? What will we tell our peoples? Is it not the duty of democratic Governments to be accountable to their voters for the discharge of their international obligations? Will we finally recognize the right to development as a fundamental, universal and inalienable human right? Will unrelenting reality persuade us that the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights requires the acknowledgment of national and regional characteristics and diverse historical, cultural and religious heritages, as well as the need to strengthen international cooperation concerning this issue objectively and without selectivity? 37 The establishment of the Office of the High Commissioner and other steps taken in this regard are just fig leaves that fail to conceal all the embarrassing parts. Many goals have yet to be reached, such as the demand of the Vienna Conference that all States abstain from adopting unilateral measures contrary to international law and the Charter of the United Nations which hinder trade relations and impede the full realization of the rights set forth in the Universal Declaration and its international instruments, particularly the right of all people to living standards adequate for their health and well-being — including nourishment, health care, housing and basic social services. What will we do to those who violate this mandate? Do we summon them to an international criminal tribunal? Under what charges: contempt for democratic decisions; State terrorism; war Crimes; genocide? It would seem that the disturbing words of the writer and humanist John Milton are true: “They who have put out the people?s eyes, reproach them of their blindness.” I say this because the United States Government has ignored all those complaints in the same way as it has drafted lists of presumed violators. In a blatant challenge to the international community, the advocates of open markets and the end of ideologies have taken additional and distinctly extraterritorial actions aimed at reinforcing their blockade. I ask the interpreters to be accurate: I mean blockade and not embargo. It is an economic, trade and financial blockade against Cuba that ignores six consecutive calls by the Assembly to put an end to what has rightly been fairly described as the grossest, most serious and systematic violation of the human rights of a whole people. On the contrary, those concerned insist on continuing their failed policy, one of whose instruments was exemplarily dismantled by the international community at the fifty-fourth session of the Commission on Human Rights, when it was decided to put an end to the extraordinary procedure on the so-called situation of Cuba and to get rid of the Special Rapporteur. That was a conscious and considered decision, the ultimate assertion of the growing rejection of a politicized resolution that should never have existed in the first place. It was recognition of the truth and a result of the weariness caused by calumny and lies. It was also the way out of a discriminatory, unwarranted and selective exercise targeted on Cuba that consecrated the imperial will to dictate a kind of international law where the powerful and wealthy judge and we, the poor, are doomed to sit on the defendants? bench. Nevertheless, we have amassed enough evidence to indicate that a new vendetta is under way. The failed attempts last July in the Economic and Social Council to imposed a so-called joint statement on the presumed human rights situation in Cuba, and subsequent initiatives to engage high United Nations authorities or particular countries in the preposterous and unsuccessful task of the late Special Rapporteur, foreshadow new and unwarranted conflicts that will again divert the Organization from its main concerns. I am referring to documents and guidelines such as these, which I could quote and which will be made available to the press, and which have been forwarded to almost all participants in this room by senior officials of a Government that, in keeping with its imperial philosophy, seems to think that they are entitled to speak but not required to listen humbly and respectfully. I quote from the document: “Multilateral efforts suffered a serious setback last April when the United Nations Commission on Human Rights voted against a resolution on Cuba by a margin of 19 to 16, with 18 abstentions.” “Maintaining international focus on the human rights situation in Cuba is a high priority for Secretary of State Albright. She has asked me to speak with you our interest in pursuing a joint statement on Cuba at ECOSOC.” “We feel that the most effective approach would be a joint statement of like-minded countries. The statement could call on the United Nations system to keep the human rights situation in Cuba under review. One mechanism for doing so could be the establishment in Havana of an office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights”. The general thrust is clear. We take full responsibility in asserting that reconsidering the issue will only mean opening yet another, even more unacceptable chapter in the political manipulation of human rights mechanisms. This would be 38 detrimental to the authority of the body or the relevant office, because our country would not accept the reimposition of any new procedure or discriminatory treatment. Everything we do in Cuba, whether some like it or not, whether agreed or not, is done for the sake of the human being. We are proud of our reality and, as we have said before, we do not believe it is perfect. We do not want it to be perfect. We do not want to be bored with perfection. We do not take it as an endorsement or export it as a model, and above all we do not impose it on anyone, so no one will attempt to impose their reality on us. We do not use our agreements or disagreements with others, including our differences with the very harsh, silenced reality of our accusers, to humiliate or condemn anyone. We prefer to discuss them by means of civilized dialogue, which we are at all times prepared to engage in, believing that what really matters is cooperation and not the imposition of a dubious convergence in positions. Cuba is among the few Members of this Organization that has consistently submitted its reports systematically and in good time to the treaty bodies to which it belongs. Evidence abounds of the transparency and sincerity of our actions and of the strength with which we uphold impartiality and objectivity in the Committees on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Committee against Torture, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. We have similar credentials in our systematic cooperation with the various mechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights and with the Office of the High Commissioner, since its inception. Let me mention also our growing bilateral cooperation in this area with various States in an atmosphere of respect and on an equal footing, each one of us with our respective virtues and flaws. For these reasons, while we denounce these new intentions and forewarn the Assembly against unwarranted, diversionist and fruitless exercises, we reiterate Cuba?s unrestricted willingness and preparedness for dialogue and for multilateral and bilateral cooperation with all States. No imposed solution can settle a problem. The international community should never allow a cause as noble and compelling as that of human rights to be held hostage to petty political interests. Cuba is confident that dialogue will prevail over confrontation and recalls, as a token of its goodwill, the invitations it has extended to the thematic rapporteurs on violence against women, on children, on mercenary practices and on other matters, so they can become acquainted with the realities of a socialism that has never needed to proclaim its intrinsic humanity. Unfortunately, however, on occasions when it has broadly disseminated the required information with transparency, that information has at times been manipulated and used to serve the interests and objectives of our aggressors. So long as Cuban children suffering from leukemia are denied access to Oncaspar and L-Spar to prolong their lives; so long as Cuban AIDS patients are denied access to AZT; so long as urgently needed purchases of respirators for newborn babies in intensive care units are hampered; so long as it is forbidden to sell to Cuba a single pound of metrotrexate to test important medicines against cancer; so long as a 33 per cent drop in the population?s daily consumption of calories and a 39 per cent drop in the consumption of proteins is artificially and intentionally provoked by a ban on food exports, by excessive freight costs and prices, and by the harassment of suppliers; so long as attempts are made to starve us to death and to kill us with diseases, while speculation and manipulation is under way with feigned official aid presented as a humanitarian gesture, which we refuse because we believe it to be insincere; as long as letters such as the one I am holding — I feel compelled to show them, and they will be made available to all — unilaterally justify confusing, contradictory and threatening understandings aimed at globalizing extraterritorial laws, it would be absolutely outrageous, immoral and even shameful to question Cuba?s just and sovereign limits, legitimized by the 1948 Universal Declaration itself, that our Government and people are forced to place on those who, wielding human rights in the abstract, defame their homeland, disown their people, foster division and serve the interests of a foreign Power. I quote from the letter from Mrs. Albright to Senator Jesse Helms: “The understanding is an important step forward in our ongoing efforts to encourage greater respect for property rights of United States citizens abroad. “We expect the full cooperation of the Europeans in carrying out the understanding. 39 “It is important that we not miss this unique and historic opportunity to advance the goals of the Libertad Act and to establish broad new protections for the property rights of United States citizens in Cuba and throughout the world.” Certainly, this is worthy of note. What Mrs. Albright calls the Libertad Act in her letter is nothing but the regrettably notorious Act that has often been repudiated by the international community: the Helms-Burton Act. I am clarifying this because I know that for most of the members of this Assembly it would be difficult to equate a juridical instrument of this type with a lofty but often misused word such as “freedom”. A self-respecting nation does not allow its dignity and intelligence to be offended. A people that has fought and endured such a barbaric onslaught will never be brought to its knees. A people that exists today because it has learned to overcome its difficulties will never be shattered, let alone convinced of the urgency of any cause besides the revolt of the united. We the poor are so many and our poverty so great that if we unite, the unity of our poverty will become our greatest asset. This will be our wealth, and we have more than enough poverty to become immensely rich. Let us set aside our differences. Let us carry on our shoulders the salvation of humanity. Let us gather those who, resourceful and wealthy though they may be, can still feel in their hearts the urgent call for survival in the global era. Let the world recognize our sincere vote as poor people, and if there is no other choice, let it hear our veto as well. Let us all unite in the struggle. As President Fidel Castro has said, Cuba will never tire of calling for this. Let us unite and globalize our opposition to every boastful act of hegemony. Let us globalize respect for our human condition, which is the first and foremost right to be claimed. Let us globalize the efforts to save from ecological catastrophe a planet that has been ruined by neoliberalism and consumerism. Let us globalize ethics, culture and the spirituality of peoples in their immense and wonderful diversity, so that each of us can drink from his own spring and we can pour our clearest waters into the great river of human thought. Let us globalize, without excluding anyone, science, technology, development and cooperation between nations. Let the rich share their wealth. Let the poor grow, the illiterate learn to read and write, the sick heal. Let the healthy remain healthy and the hungry have food. Let us globalize generosity and eradicate plundering, selfishness and greed. Let us globalize respect for the rights of others as a guarantee of peace for all races, ethnicities and religions, so that we may bid farewell to arms. Let us globalize human freedom as the most sacred trait of our species. Let this be a responsible freedom, with peace and independence, dignity and sovereignty, without humiliation or conditions, without alterations or renunciations — a freedom emerging from the rebellion of human beings against a world that no longer meets their needs and that they are determined to change, as set out in the preamble and article 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We do not want these freedoms ever to be politicized; we want them to remain entirely human. In a few days it will be 40 years since the dawn of Cuba's knowledge of that freedom that re-established the rights of Cubans and enshrined our humanity, because that freedom was born in our own breasts and nourished by the blood, sweat, efforts and sacrifices of so many generations. That freedom is still alive today, shielded by an all- enduring unity. It encourages our rebelliousness in the face of a world that deserves to be and can be changed for the sake of all mankind. As the book of Ecclesiastes commands: “To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.” (The Holy Bible, Ecclesiastes 3:1) Now is the time and the exact hour that we must act. It is a true pleasure for me to address the General Assembly once more. I wish first of all to echo previous speakers in congratulating you most warmly, Sir, on behalf of my delegation, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. I take this opportunity also to express our gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for the excellent work carried out under his presidency. To the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, we reaffirm our confidence in his outstanding endeavours to preserve peace and to promote development. To all participants in the fifty-third session, I wish the greatest success in the interests of all our peoples. Ten days ago hurricane Georges passed through the Caribbean region, striking several of our countries with its fury and leaving considerable damage in its wake. I wish to express deepest sympathy, on behalf of Haiti, to our brotherly Governments and peoples who, like us, were so hard hit by this unavoidable disaster. The provisional toll in Haiti is quite heavy: 150 dead and dozens missing — more than 500,000 victims all told. There was considerable material damage to agriculture and to infrastructure: roads and bridges were destroyed and crops devastated in several regions. The total cost of these losses is estimated at approximately $200 million. International solidarity was quickly displayed in the wake of this disaster. I would therefore like to thank all the friendly Governments, international institutions and non- governmental organizations for the support they have given us thus far. While the present situation is serious, our concern for the future is even greater. With over 60 per cent of our agricultural production destroyed, the outlook is extremely bleak. We fear that once emergency aid is no longer being provided in the coming months there will be a severe shortage of foodstuffs and basic goods. We therefore appeal to the international community to extend considerable assistance to our efforts to restore and rebuild the affected zones and to support our measures to solve the public health problems that will arise. In this regard, we invite delegations to support draft resolution A/53/L.2/Rev.1, which will soon be introduced to the General Assembly, as a first step in this direction. Profound changes have taken place in international relations in the course of the last 10 years. The lessening of ideological confrontation and the strengthening of interdependence among nations have provided new opportunities for closer cooperation among States. The phenomenon of globalization, which is characterized by unprecedented ties between human activities throughout the world, has expanded further and has been propelled by spectacular growth in communications. Some had anticipated a more peaceful and united world in the next century. Yet, less than 500 days away from the year 2000, the international picture is frankly disconcerting. New hotbeds of tension have arisen in many regions of the world, while no substantial progress has been made to resolve various age-old conflicts. That is the case in the Middle East, where we hope that the recent discussions held this week in Washington will serve to permanently revive the peace process that has been stalled for more than a year. We deplore the armed conflicts that have brought untold suffering on populations, be it in Kosovo, Angola, Afghanistan, the Great Lakes region or elsewhere. The Republic of Haiti invites the parties concerned to seek a solution to their problems through dialogue. The international community must also continue to carry out efforts to restore peace to these regions. International terrorism, of which we had hoped to have seen the last, has re-emerged in a troubling fashion with the terrible events that have taken place in Africa and Northern Ireland. In condemning these acts, Haiti calls on the international community to adopt effective measures to combat this threat to international security. Elsewhere, the world is facing a real challenge whose consequences are incalculable on more than one front. I am referring to drug-trafficking and its related crimes — arms-trafficking, organized crime and money- laundering. The problem of drug-trafficking continues to threaten the integrity of our territories, to weaken the foundations of our societies and to undermine the health of our peoples. Combating this scourge requires further cooperation at the bilateral, regional and international levels, as was highlighted at the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the drugs problem. Haiti, 8 which has unfortunately been used as a transit country for some of the drugs headed for markets in consumer countries, has adopted a vigorous policy that has already begun to bear fruit. This involves the drafting of legislative measures against drug-trafficking and money-laundering; the establishment of a body entrusted with combating trafficking in narcotic drugs; the development of cooperation with neighbouring countries; and accession to international instruments in this area. In speaking of the dangers threatening the future of mankind, I must refer here to the existence of considerable stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, in particular nuclear weapons. The Republic of Haiti welcomes the recent progress achieved in the reduction of these weapons. It will continue to support wholeheartedly the efforts of the international community for their complete elimination. In this connection, Haiti deplored the nuclear tests recently carried out by India and Pakistan, which have contributed to increasing tensions in that part of the world. It invites those countries to become parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The global economic situation at the end of this century has also given rise to many concerns. The phenomenon of globalization, which is characterized by a liberalization of market forces, which, according to numerous observers, should accelerate growth and promote development, has above all been marked by greater inequality and sluggish growth. The income gap between North and South has continued to widen. In 1965 the average per capita income in the G-7 countries was 20 times that of the world’s seven poorest countries; by 1995 that figure had almost doubled. Today poverty continues to grow throughout the world. Entire populations are victims of the serious problems of malnutrition and abject poverty. Health care and education are inaccessible to millions of people. There has been further destruction of the environment throughout the world, threatening the very survival of mankind. Even more than the countries of the third world, which have been battered by these global developments, the least developed countries — including my country, Haiti — find themselves ever more marginalized and must face a worsening of the standard of living of their peoples. The feeling of despair is increasingly spreading among younger generations facing a seemingly gloomy future. All of this poses serious threats to the very stability of our countries. This situation cries out for the international community to redouble its efforts to combat poverty. United and concerted long-term action that mobilizes considerable resources is essential if we wish to achieve satisfactory results. The magnitude of current problems poses a major challenge to the international community. The United Nations, whose primary mission is to ensure world security and to promote economic and social progress for people, is the ideal forum to discuss these questions and to search for solutions that take everyone’s interests into account. It must be able to play the role that has been entrusted to it in order to create a global situation of peace, which will facilitate development through cooperation for all peoples. It must respond to this challenge by using its resources effectively and by adapting itself to changes in international relations. In this regard, the delegation of Haiti welcomes the reform process initiated by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to breathe new life into the Organization and to better enable it to face the increasingly complex problems of today’s world. The initial measures approved by the General Assembly have enabled United Nations bodies to work more coherently and consistently. We hope that further measures to be considered at this session will strengthen the capacities of the United Nations to carry out its activities. Reform in the Security Council, which has been discussed for five years now, is of capital importance given the role played by that organ in the maintenance of international peace and security. Haiti continues to call for greater openness in the functioning of the Council and for greater participation in the decision-making process, so that its decisions reflect the general opinion of the international community as a whole and not only the position of the members of the Council. In this context, the envisaged increase in its membership must take into account more systematically the principle of equitable geographical distribution. Every effort must be made to ensure that the universality of all the planet’s inhabitants is reflected in the United Nations system. In this respect, we welcome the dialogue between the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan. A positive outcome to this dialogue will allow for progress in this area. This year we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human 9 Rights. By enshrining the principle of the respect of fundamental human rights and by ensuring their promotion, the United Nations has made a considerable contribution to the development of an international system to protect the fundamental freedoms and ensure the emancipation of peoples throughout the world. Along these lines, my delegation welcomes the fact that the international community has finally acknowledged that the right to development is an intrinsic part of fundamental human rights. But that acknowledgment is not sufficient. We must work to ensure full respect for that right by establishing programmes and by mobilizing sufficient resources. Today human rights are a reality that no Government can ignore. In Haiti respect for human rights is guaranteed in the Constitution, and the Government is committed to ensuring the full enjoyment of those rights by all. In this context, reform in the judicial machinery that will allow for the consolidation of the state of law is now being implemented. Regrettably, however, the very complex situation resulting from a twofold electoral and governmental problem has made it difficult for institutions to function normally and to cooperate with the international community. To overcome this handicap, the President of the Republic, Mr. René Préval, is resolutely undertaking every possible effort. Democratic institutions necessarily have a role to play, but given the regrettably slow process of democracy- building, the hoped-for results have not yet been achieved despite the numerous initiatives undertaken. It is encouraging to note, however, that these expectations and initiatives have been undertaken within the framework of the provisions of the Constitution, which guarantees that a viable solution will be found. Similarly, the head of State has consulted all levels of Haitian society in order to set up a new electoral council that will be responsible for organizing, in accordance with the Constitution and as soon as possible, free, fair and democratic elections at the municipal and legislative levels. He will do everything in his power to guarantee the participation of all sectors in these elections, which, duly carried out, will help us overcome the governmental crisis that has arisen. Despite the unfavourable circumstances that have darkened the horizon at the dawning of the third millennium, we must not lose hope in a better world. In order to do that, we must further develop cooperation, strengthen our partnerships and work together to improve our peoples’ standard of living in a world where so many natural disasters and environmental phenomena remind us of our duty to solidarity. The United Nations is the ideal framework for joining our efforts to achieve this common goal.  Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. With your experience and dedication to the goals of this Organization, you will guide us wisely and effectively in our work this year. And important work it is, for as the century draws to a close, our security is more precarious than ever. The spectrum of threats is wide and growing. Traditional dangers persist, including the proliferation of weapons. But new threats — terrorism, crime and drugs — arise from a world in which the face of conflict has changed. Economic and social insecurity for the majority of our global population is on the rise. Increasingly, it is the well-being of individuals that is directly at stake. (spoke in French) There is an urgent need for solutions. The interdependence of all of our lives is unprecedented. It is essential for us to work together to confront these challenges. This means working through a vibrant United Nations. For Canada, the universal values set out in the Charter have acted as our moral compass in setting our global agenda. The United Nations system serves as the instrument in achieving our goals. (spoke in English) At the same time we recognize that the United Nations faces its own worries, and it, too, must change. But a strong, reinvigorated United Nations is still the best foundation for the future. As the contours of that future emerge, there is reason for hope. While old realities of power persist, a new system based on humanitarian standards, practices and law based upon needs and human security is beginning to show through. Perhaps this new reality can best be seen in the common effort to eliminate anti-personnel landmines. The Secretary-General has hailed the adoption of the Ottawa Convention as an unprecedented achievement — one accomplished through a unique partnership of non- governmental organizations, Member States and international groups working together to eliminate a weapons system that victimizes the innocent. 23 Last week, Burkina Faso deposited the fortieth ratification of the treaty, thereby crossing the threshold needed to bring the treaty into force. This treaty, which has already attracted 130 signatories and 41 ratifications, will become part of the international legal framework as of 1 March next year. We welcome the offer by Mozambique to host the first meeting of the States parties to the Convention. We continue to urge those who have not done so to sign and ratify the Convention and join in this international endeavour. But entry into force is just the first important step in bringing the treaty to life. Now we have to meet the treaty?s goals. An effective coalition for action must work together in this next phase to take the mines out of the ground and to help the victims. The United Nations, through its mine action service, will mobilize and coordinate the efforts of the international community. At the signing of the treaty on landmines in Ottawa last December, countries pledged $0.5 billion for mine action. My own Government has allocated $100 million as Canada?s contribution to rid the world of these very cruel weapons. We have already put the money to work in some of the most severely affected States, with projects in Mozambique, Cambodia, Bosnia and Central America. Now we must put everyone?s resources to work. Landmines are not the only weapons that take a tragic, disproportionate toll on civilian populations. Small arms and light military weapons — cheap and easy to transport, smuggle or hide — have become the tools of choice for smugglers, terrorists and criminals. The challenges arising from the proliferation and widespread abuse of small arms and light weapons are complex. But the impact on all of us, especially the most vulnerable, is direct and devastating. Eighty per cent of the victims are women and children. There are no easy solutions and no shortcuts. We cannot, however, afford to shrink from facing such a pervasive threat to our security. In Canada we pursue a three-pronged approach, dealing with the legal trade, illicit trafficking and peace-building challenges of small-arms proliferation. We hope, by working with others in the United Nations, to see the use of this terrible weapon come to an end. Illegal drug-trafficking also threatens our peoples? security. The drug trade affects governance, undermines human rights and promotes cross-border conflicts. That is why Canada has proposed a Foreign Ministers? dialogue group in the Americas. We hope that this will be a forum which can provide guidance and generate ideas to help us curtail the collateral impact of the drug trade on Governments and on society. These and other emerging threats to our security, including terrorism, crime and environmental degradation, affect every one of us but are beyond the reach of any of us alone. They demand global, integrated solutions, which the United Nations is best suited to provide. The International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, concluded last year, ongoing work in developing a convention on transnational organized crime and the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change — all show that we are capable of working together to enhance our human security. Moving the human security agenda forward also requires that we redouble efforts to address the root causes of conflict and risk. Peace and stability are indispensable to security, but they are not, regrettably, humanity?s birthright. They must be built. Two years ago, we launched the Canadian Peace-building Initiative. Its objective is to address the unique challenges of societies recovering from conflict. Through this initiative, projects have been undertaken in Guatemala to assist civil society to implement the peace agreements, in Bosnia to promote awareness of the peace accords, in Mozambique to support a programme to exchange weapons for farming tools, and in West Africa to support the initiative led by Mali to promote a West African arms moratorium. These are small steps, certainly, but constructive ones in working locally to build peace. Today, I am pleased to release a report entitled “Peace in Progress”, which documents the results obtained to date and the wide range of partners with whom we have worked. As the title suggests, Canada intends to carry on with its partners in empowering those working to build peaceful and stable societies in their own countries. It has been a half-century since a distinguished Canadian international civil servant, John Humphrey, wrote the first draft of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since then over 60 international human rights instruments have been adopted. Countries have shown a new and welcome willingness to cooperate with the international human rights system. But we must build on that progress, and one of the most important ways that the Assembly can make its contribution this year is to support a strong United Nations declaration on human rights defenders to protect 24 those who are protecting those whose human rights are being abused. (spoke in French) The growing integration of human rights, including women?s rights, into all other aspects of United Nations activity is a recent and important breakthrough. On the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the conditions exist to achieve progress in attaining the goals set out by its drafters. This is good news. However, a review of the human rights situation around the globe makes it painfully clear that we remain far short of these goals. We need to take advantage of the momentum that this anniversary presents. The United Nations human rights system must be assured of both the political support of the membership and increased regular budget financing if it is to do the job we have entrusted to it. (spoke in English) The growth of intra-State conflicts caused by differences of religion, language, race or ethnicity has reinforced the need to protect marginalized groups. To do so, both Governments and civil society must have ready access to information about human rights situations around the world. To this end, Canada has launched for the record an annual report drawn from United Nations sources, which we are making available on the Internet to provide constant updated information concerning human rights around the globe. Certainly, of those at risk from conflict, none are more at risk than children. The targeting of children in warfare — both as fighters and as victims — is intolerable. The ground-breaking efforts of Graça Machel and the work of the Secretary-General?s Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, Olara Otunnu, merit special and ongoing support. Enhancing human security also requires establishing legal instruments. The agreement in Rome to establish the International Criminal Court is a major fundamental step towards that goal. This Court will help to deter some of the most serious violations of international humanitarian law. It will help give new meaning and global reach to protecting the vulnerable and the innocent. By isolating and stigmatizing those who commit war crimes or genocide and removing them from the community, it will help end cycles of impunity and retribution. Without justice there is no reconciliation, and without reconciliation there can be no peace. We need to move forward urgently in making the Court a reality. We should begin during this session of the General Assembly to bring the Court into operation. We who have supported the Court should ratify the Statute as soon as possible. We must also work to understand and address the concerns of those States that remain hesitant about the Court — without diluting its effectiveness. Ultimately, we must ensure that we have an institution that will be credible, responsible and effective. Respect for civil and political rights is necessary, but in itself is not sufficient to create the conditions for stable societies. Stability also requires economic and social well- being. Regrettably, statistics show that countries with the lowest income are much more likely to fall victim to violent conflict than others. The number of people whose basic human needs are not being met remains unacceptably and dangerously high. A quarter of the world?s people live in severe poverty; more than 800 million face malnutrition; 180 million children under the age of 14 work as child labourers. As the United Nations human development index makes clear this year, the gap between the haves and the have-nots continues to grow. Countries overburdened by debt are less likely to be developed and more likely to succumb to conflict. Reducing the debt of the least developed nations allows them to devote more resources to basic human needs. That is why at the summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Ouagadougou I announced a $20 million contribution to the African Development Bank to support the most heavily indebted African countries. That is also why Canada has forgiven virtually all development-related debt owed to us by the least developed countries — almost $1 billion — and why we encourage others who have not already done so to do likewise. I think we all recognize that globalization presents opportunities, but it also exposes all of us, especially the most vulnerable, to greater economic and social insecurity. The international financial turmoil of the past months vividly demonstrates the impact these crises can have on the daily lives of the least fortunate. It means that we need to be sensitive to the social consequences of financial volatility. And when crisis strikes, the United Nations and its specialized agencies have a special responsibility to assist those most severely affected. 25 There is no greater threat to our security than nuclear proliferation. In 1945, Canada, despite the experience of the most destructive war in history, decided to forgo the nuclear option even though, as a participant in the Manhattan Project, we had the technical capability and material capacity to build our own nuclear weapons. In 1968, the Government of Canada confirmed that decision and joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Every subsequent Canadian Government has reaffirmed that commitment, and we have spent much diplomatic effort to persuade others that nuclear weapons are the problem, not the solution. The non-proliferation regime has enhanced everyone?s security. The credibility of that regime has been severely tested over the years, but particularly over the past six months. India?s and Pakistan?s nuclear tests put the entire non-proliferation regime in jeopardy. Nuclear testing undermines the basic goals and objectives of the Non- Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty. Testing puts all of us, not least the people of the testing countries themselves, at greater risk. Therefore, there can be no condoning these actions. And there must be no rewards. We must not legitimize the claims of would-be nuclear Powers, or confer any new status on proliferators. We listened carefully to the presentations of the Presidents of India and of Pakistan this week and we welcome the indications they gave that they would sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. But it is important to reiterate that Security Council resolution 1172 (1998) calls upon India and Pakistan to sign the Treaty without conditions, to participate purposefully in the negotiations on a cut-off treaty on fissile materials, to stop the weaponization of their nuclear programmes, to impose strict export controls on nuclear technology and to embrace fully the non-proliferation regime. We urge them to do so. In that spirit, we welcome India?s and Pakistan?s decision to relaunch their dialogue on Kashmir. We also recognize that preventing horizontal proliferation, while crucial, is no more important than preventing vertical proliferation. Nuclear disarmament is the other half of the nuclear bargain. That bargain is a balance of responsibilities and obligations undertaken by nuclear-weapon and non- nuclear-weapon States alike. Not all nuclear-weapon States have begun to fulfil their obligations under Article VI of the Non-proliferation Treaty, and we call upon them to fulfil their responsibilities. As we all recognize, this period of globalization multiplies the challenges. It is Canada?s conviction that a dynamic, responsive and flexible United Nations system is the best way, perhaps the only way, to meet these challenges. (spoke in French) To fulfil its leadership responsibilities, the United Nations must be assured of reliable and adequate funding. We cannot revitalize the United Nations so long as Member States, particularly the most wealthy and fortunate among them, contribute less to a system from which they demand more. Renewal can be achieved only if Member States pay their assessed dues, present and past due, on time and without conditions. (spoke in English) Let me now speak of the Security Council. The Security Council remains at the centre of what the United Nations is all about: protecting against conflict and human risk. However, the Council?s legitimacy is increasingly being questioned. To remain credible, the Council must re-examine traditional interpretations of its mandate. The Council needs to broaden its horizons in addressing emerging threats which impact on our security. Thematic debates on these issues, in which all Member States can participate, are a good step. The addition of peace- building to the Council?s range of responses to threats to peace and security is also welcome. But the Council must also be more willing and more consistent in both how and when it becomes involved. The Council belongs to all Member States. It cannot be allowed to focus on solving the problems of one region and be indifferent to those of others. The way the Council does its work must be more open and more transparent. For example, Member States involved in and affected by matters before the Council must be allowed to exercise their Charter rights. Far from constraining the Council?s efficiency, this will improve the decisions it takes and render its actions more effective. The trend for permanent members increasingly to assume more control over the agenda, thereby marginalizing elected members, runs counter to the democratic principles which so inform our political institutions at the close of the twentieth century. The distinctions between permanent and elected members need to be narrowed rather than widened. 26 In sum, the Council we need for the next century must be more responsible, more accountable and less impenetrable. We hope that members will support Canada in advancing these aspirations.   Allow me, Mr. President, to offer you my warmest congratulations on your unanimous election to guide the work of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. The honour bestowed upon you attests to the good relations which your country, Uruguay, has forged over the decades with the nations that make up the international community. The noble task which awaits you, far from being merely prestigious or simply one of protocol, frequently proves to be both delicate and difficult. It involves presiding over the most eminent forum of debate for world affairs during a period in which, in various places, one crisis follows another, such that around the world neither peace nor war prevails. I am convinced that your talents as a diplomat, your passion for peace and development and your enthusiasm will 33 serve you well in dealing with the most complex debates and the most tangled webs of procedure. Rest assured that our best wishes will be with you throughout this session, which, we feel sure, under your expert presidency, will be crowned with success. I wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor, H. E. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for the remarkable way in which he guided our work in the last session and for the personal touch with which he ensured and improved coordination between the main bodies of the United Nations. We feel certain that in his parliamentary career in his country he will display the same efficiency and skill he showed in this forum. Finally, allow me to pay an emphatic tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who, through his tireless commitment, has been able to restore confidence in our Organization and make it an incomparable instrument for international relations. I wish to hail his efforts to bring peace to the world, and particularly to Africa, and the special attention he gives to the economic and political situation on our continent. I also wish to take this opportunity, on behalf of my delegation, to congratulate him sincerely on his excellent report on the work of the Organization, the clarity and conciseness of which will be very useful in inspiring our debate during the fifty-third session. During the past year, the world has entered a phase of difficulties and uncertainties such as it had not seen for almost a decade. The crisis born in the most dynamic economies of South-East Asia has gradually reached other regions. Today it seems to threaten all the countries of the planet, from the richest to the poorest. This shows very well the extent to which the phenomena of globalization and interdependence among States and peoples have spread. No country, no matter how prosperous, can now hope to escape a crisis such as the one South-East Asia has suffered and continues to suffer which now threatens other regions. This shows that the fight for development and the struggle against poverty concern all of us. Emergent economies, which are paying the price of a crisis that, over these last months, has thrown tens of millions of people back into poverty and insecurity, are integral parts of a sort of a global economic and financial puzzle. The jolts these economies are experiencing weaken the whole system. This risk, which everyone can see is real, should lead us to reconsider our traditional notion of the division between countries of the North and of the South. We should not, of course, ignore here the gulf between North and South or challenge the existence of the distinct forms of poverty that make for starkly different conditions of existence, and even survival, for the most destitute peoples of the industrialized countries and those of the developing countries. What, on the other hand, is more and more questionable with the advance of globalization is the idea of a possible divergence of destinies, which could lead some countries â€” the wealthiest â€” to continue their march forward, while leaving the poor ones â€œalong the side of the roadâ€, to quote a popular phrase. The crisis we have been witnessing for a year now should convince us that there is a common destiny which binds together all Governments and all peoples of the planet. The latter, whether they are richer or poorer, are bound by the same necessity â€” that of progressing together along the path of development. The current crisis shows us another vital need â€” that of solidarity, for which multilateral cooperation is the prime instrument. The United Nations must once again become the natural vehicle of this multilateral cooperation. Unfortunately, we must note that this notion of solidarity, which has become an agreed formula in official declarations, is acted upon less and less in any concrete way. We recall the famous objective â€” which a few decades ago seemed quite modest â€” of establishing the desirable level of official development assistance at 0.7 per cent of gross national product of industrialized countries. In noting, as the Secretary-General has done in his report on the work of the Organization, that official development assistance has been steadily decreasing for a decade and today represents only 0.22 per cent of the gross national product of industrialized countries, we must recognize that this call for solidarity is reaching increasingly deaf ears in international forums. Along the same lines, I would like to stress that the strategies for development debated and agreed among Governments, as well as the decisions adopted at the major United Nations conferences, so far have not been implemented to the desired extent, due to insufficient financing. The mid-term evaluation of the outcome of the Rio Conference on Environment and Development was in this respect quite revealing of the present financial limits for aid to development. An effort commensurate with the 34 problem would allow us to radically change its basic elements. The 1998 Human Development Report, published by the United Nations Development Programme a few weeks ago, makes some significant comparisons. It shows, for example, that Americans annually spend $8 billion on cosmetics â€” $2 billion more than the amount needed to finance basic education for a large part of the world population. To quote the Secretary-Generalâs report on the work of the Organization, â€œa bridge must be constructed between, in effect, the Dow Jones index and the human development indexâ€ (A/53/1, para. 15). We expect also that a new drive towards cooperation and development will not only combat poverty and exclusion but also promote international peace and security. Conflicts frequently have social and economic roots, and this dimension should be fully integrated into the approaches devised by the international community in the areas of conflict prevention, peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building. I wish to reiterate, and express the support of CÃ´te dâIvoire for, the proposal made by the Secretary-General in paragraph 30 of his report on the work of the Organization to better use the possibilities of Article 65 of the Charter of the United Nations, which provides that the Economic and Social Council may furnish information to the Security Council upon a request from the latter. With the exception of very limited applications in 1949 and 1959, this provision of the Charter has not been invoked. Because it is based on fraternity, dignity and equality between peoples and States, solidarity needs to be the cardinal value in the new world that is emerging from the ideological battlefields of the past. Progress in communications technology has today brought people closer than ever. Stepping outside of their own cultures, men and women can experience the same events at the very same moment. They are upset and shocked by the pictures and consequences of a natural disaster or a terrorist attack. They are impassioned by the same sports events and are reduced to tears by exceptional events such as the liberation of Nelson Mandela or the fall of the Berlin Wall, which give true ethical significance to the evolution of humankind. During the past decade, we have witnessed spectacular progress, in almost all countries, with respect to the positive values that cement solidarity between peoples. Almost all societies are now open and receptive to pluralism. Every day I see that the peoples of the African continent are hungering for participation. They wish to have their say in national matters and to take their future into their own hands. Throughout the world, civil society is making its claims and aspirations felt. Everywhere Governments, to varying degrees, are becoming aware of this extraordinary change and, in the context of diverse political formulas and variable schedules, they are acceding to the demands of the people with respect to democratization. This new global focus on human rights and pluralism is reflected increasingly in the international order. Buttressed by the non-governmental organizations, Governments have decided to ban barbaric weapons such as anti-personnel landmines, whose principal victims are civilians, especially children. The broad and massive support given by the international community to the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, which has been signed by 128 States and which will enter into force after the deposit by the fortieth State of its instrument of ratification, allows us to hope for success in the efforts undertaken to fight against another scourge â€” small arms and small-calibre weapons â€” which affects mainly civilians and foster criminality and insecurity. Global progress on the ethical level is evident also in the adoption in July 1998 of the Statute of the International Criminal Court, thus enshrining the progress begun by the international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda. In this respect, the first judgments, handed down on 2 September last, have a dual significance. Fifty years after its adoption by the General Assembly, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide has now seen a concrete continuance: the appalling crime of genocide, repeatedly carried out since 1945, will no longer go unpunished. The second positive element of the judgments rendered by the Arusha Tribunal is the recognition that sexual violence committed systematically and on a broad scale in the context of conflicts meets the definition of the crime of genocide. Another concern for my Government is the scourge of terrorism, a true hydra-headed menace that is blindly 35 attacking in places where we least expect it. It is no longer enough to forcefully condemn this evil; we must try to extirpate its roots as it stems, with rare exceptions, from injustice or the intolerable humiliation of peoples. The fight against terrorism is first and foremost a fight against injustice in all its forms. CÃ´te dâIvoire reiterates its sympathy for those States that have fallen victim to bomb attacks. It reasserts its commitment to work in the context of cooperation with all States to eradicate these crimes, which cannot be justified regardless of their motivation. The time has come, as was stated at the Non-Aligned Movement Summit in Durban, to convene an international conference dealing with all aspects of terrorism that would lead to a convention allowing us to eradicate this scourge. To strengthen cooperation for development and promote democratization and pluralism are the two focal points for the action which the international community should take in order to allow peace and security to progress, which is the fundamental mission of our Organization. This concern falls in line perfectly with the objectives of the Government of CÃ´te dâIvoire, which, under the leadership of our President, Henri Konan BÃ©diÃ©, is committed to relaunching strong, sound and lasting economic growth and to forge, in a spirit of solidarity, a more united, homogenous society based on participatory, peaceful democracy. At the political level, the cabinet reshuffle that took place on 11 August last resulted in greater openness and in new political blood. At the institutional level, several measures were adopted aimed at broadening and deepening the regionalization and decentralization process. Moreover, constitutional reform is being undertaken in order to establish the rule of law, to consolidate State structures and strengthen representative democracy. The latter has given rise to the creation of a Senate, which will help us to strengthen the democratic debate and give us a more balanced representation of the regions. At the economic level, let me stress that in 1997 â€” and for the third consecutive year â€” the rate of growth of our countryâs gross national product was 7 per cent. That rate, I would underscore, is higher than the demographic rate of growth of 3.8 per cent. Inflation was controlled at 5 per cent in 1997, whereas the rate of investment was 15 per cent of the gross national product, 70 per cent of which was private investment. It is noteworthy that the management of the Alliance for Africaâs Industrialization, which held its first meeting on 17 and 18 September last in Abidjan, reaffirmed that industrialization is a necessity for the economic progress of Africa and is the only means of transforming its economy in order to integrate it positively into the current context of globalization. Africa will continue to rely for its industrial development on its partners from friendly countries. We wish here to welcome the initiative of the Government of the United States on partnership and economic growth in Africa which aims particularly to allow a number of American products access to the American market. We wish also to express our gratitude to the Government of Japan for its continuing commitment to the development of Africa, as evidenced by the upcoming International Conference on African Development (TICAD II), set to take place in Tokyo in October. We also wish to congratulate and thank all the Governments of the donor countries that have forgiven debts to the African countries, especially the least developed ones. On the social level, I wish to take a moment to mention some points relating to health, a vital element in socio-economic development. Action in the field of health, as the Assembly knows, contributes effectively to the fight against poverty. CÃ´te dâIvoire has therefore made this an absolute priority for several decades. Aware that our world has become a global village, we have tirelessly pursued these efforts within our country, while putting more and more effort into the promotion of health at the international level. Several important recent events prove this commitment: the participation of President Henri Konan BÃ©diÃ© as the representative of our continent at the fiftieth anniversary of the World Health Organization (WHO); the adoption by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) last June of two resolutions proposed by CÃ´te dâIvoire, one relating to the African fund to combat AIDS and the other on the African initiative to fight against malaria; and the launching of the initiative on anti-retrovirus treatments, for which CÃ´te dâIvoire has been selected as one of the countries participating in the experimental phase. In order to better mark our commitment to the success of this programme, we have decided to allocate the sum of $1 million to it. 36 Moreover, CÃ´te dâIvoire organized a regional meeting, attended by the Presidents of Benin and Ghana, to promote public awareness of, and the struggle against, Buruliâs ulcer, a little-known but degrading and destructive illness. The multiplicity of conflict situations in Africa has become a real subject of concern for the entire international community. Hence the Security Council met on 25 September 1997 at Foreign Minister level to consider the need for concerted international action to promote peace and security in Africa. At the end of that meeting, the Council asked the Secretary-General to submit to it by February 1998 a report containing concrete recommendations regarding the sources of conflict in Africa, way to prevent and address them, and how to lay the foundation for durable peace and economic growth. In response to this Security Council request, the Secretary-General prepared an excellent report entitled â€œThe causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africaâ€ (S/1998/318), which gives a straightforward assessment of the political and economic situation in Africa and makes objective recommendations, while indicating the mistakes made by African leaders and the shortcomings in international cooperation in this area. The report essentially always takes us back to the primary mission of our Organization: the maintenance of peace, and the principal instrument for this, which is collective security. The latter remains at the heart of the United Nations Charter. The original idea, it should be remembered, was that in the modern world, any conflict, whether regional or local, could affect the whole of international society, and that through alliances and interventions it could well spread, with all the devastating consequences imaginable. It is in order to guard against these situations and to provide every means to react to them that the 1945 Charter, in Chapter VII, takes account of the regional character of collective security. The regional mechanism is intended to provide continuity and to strengthen the action of the international community in the maintenance of peace, without in any way challenging the primary role of the Security Council, which, duly informed of the initiatives undertaken by States bound by regional agreements, is the only body which can authorize the use of force. It is in this spirit, and always taking care to refer first to the Security Council, that the system of regional security has always functioned, be it in Africa or in Europe, even though with the involvement of the Atlantic Alliance in the former Yugoslavia the situation was somewhat different. The end of the cold war, with a backdrop of change in the general international security situation and an increasing will by the great Powers to limit themselves to interventions in the context of the United Nations, has undoubtedly contributed to the reactivation of regional security. What was at stake, we must agree, was the very survival of certain regions of the world, prey to violent upheavals and mostly abandoned to their own fate. Regrettably, this is the picture which we see in an Africa torn apart by conflicts whose scope and gravity the international community does not always grasp. These are the realities which were in the minds of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Defence, the Interior and Security of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) when they met recently in Yamoussoukro, CÃ´te dâIvoire, and then in Banjul, Gambia, to lay the foundations of a mechanism for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts and for the maintenance of peace and security. The resulting text, reached by consensus at the level of experts, will soon be submitted for adoption by the conference of heads of State and Government scheduled for the end of October in Abuja. West Africa has plenty of experience in this connection, since in recent years it has had to mobilize twice in order to settle two bloody conflicts in Liberia, followed by Sierra Leone, and has thus acquired considerable resources under the flag of the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG). The success of the organization in carrying out such interventions prompted it to institutionalize ECOMOG as its armed mechanism, which is mainly preventive. This is a big step forward for ECOWAS, originally created as a specialized subregional organization with the goal of promoting economic cooperation and eventually the integration of its member States. This subregional mechanism will of course become part of the general system of the United Nations Charter and the regional system of OAU. It will cover all aspects of security, including natural disasters. Political considerations cannot be forgotten, for experience has shown that conflicts may well lead to the decay of governmental institutions, the economy and social and political institutions. 37 Under these circumstances, any intervention strategy is designed first and foremost to deal with disarmament, demobilization and the reintegration of combatants or displaced persons, as well as the rehabilitation of infrastructures and above all the reconstruction of society, with democracy as the key word. All in all, member States believed that it was precisely because it was conceived for development and economic integration that ECOWAS was particularly suited to undertake peace-building in the region. The implementation of the mechanism will depend above all upon the political will of member States. For its part, CÃ´te dâIvoire will be involved, as it was in the quest for peace in Liberia and Sierra Leone, and as it is now in the case of mediation to bring peace back to Guinea-Bissau. I should like to take this opportunity to thank and congratulate the Governments of the United States of America, France and Great Britain for deciding to harmonize their various initiatives to assist our armies in order to enhance our peacekeeping capabilities. In this connection, I am happy that we are commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the first peacekeeping operation in 1948, and I pay tribute to the memory of all the men and women who have given their lives in the service of the United Nations. Assuring collective security in the context of credible international cooperation and guaranteeing fair, sustainable development is an ongoing challenge to the United Nations; it must urgently provide appropriate, concrete answers. In this regard, I believe that our action must be conducted on three very distinct fronts. In the first place, we must firmly recall, whenever necessary, the fundamental principles proclaimed by the San Francisco Charter concerning relations between States, and in particular the independence and territorial integrity of Member States of the United Nations. Since the end of the cold war, conflicts between States have almost entirely disappeared, and that fully reflects the legal force of the principles I have just mentioned. Let me stress that in Africa the principle of the inviolability of borders is of capital importance, as the OAU has emphasized since its establishment. The upheavals in the Great Lakes region must be settled in accordance with this principle. Secondly, it is necessary to discourage and ban from international society those regimes which violate the most elementary principles of democracy. Finally, it is vital to enhance international peace by a clear delineation of the responsibilities of the United Nations and regional organizations. In this connection, we would like to note and hail the complementarity and harmony of efforts made, within the context of the United Nations, by the Non-Aligned Movement, the OAU and the Southern African Development Community (SADC), in order to put an end to the new crisis besetting the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Their combined forces have secured the return to stability of several West African countries. Here, I would like to salute in particular the action of ECOWAS and its military component, ECOMOG, and invite the international community to provide them with every possible support necessary for the accomplishment of their mission. This interaction between the world Organization and regional organizations must be further strengthened in the future. In conclusion, I would like briefly to mention the veritable â€œsea serpentâ€ of the process of reforming the United Nations and the United Nations system and to express a certain disappointment at the very limited results we have achieved after several years of effort. The question of restructuring the Security Council seems to be at a standstill, even though, in almost ritual fashion, at one session after another we renew the mandate of the Working Group charged with reaching an agreement acceptable to all Member States. As for the excellent reform programme that the Secretary-General presented to us last year, it has certainly been very positively received, but we have postponed certain decisions that are ours alone to make with regard to certain of his suggestions and recommendations. I hope that the present session of the General Assembly will enable us to enrich our thinking on reform and finally move on to action in this sphere. For the first time, Palestine is participating in the work of the General Assembly under the agenda item entitled “General debate”. That participation is a result of the resolution adopted by the Assembly on upgrading Palestine’s representation at the United Nations, which we consider to be an essential step towards full membership. I would like, at this time, to express the deep gratitude of the Palestinian people to all Member States that supported this important resolution by an overwhelming majority. They have thus reflected the will of the States and peoples of the world for the need to realize justice for the Palestinian people in order to regain their international status and their seat at the United Nations. I would like to extend to you, Mr. President, our sincere congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at the fifty-third session. I wish you complete success in your important and noble task during these crucial times in our contemporary world and in our international Organization. I also extend our gratitude and appreciation to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for guiding and presiding effectively over the fifty-second session. I would like in particular to praise his leadership during the resumed tenth emergency special session of the General Assembly on illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories. It gives me great pleasure to commend the Secretary-General of the United Nations, our friend Mr. Kofi Annan, for his distinguished and wise leadership, and I congratulate him for the many successes he has achieved in several fields. We had the honour, Mr. Secretary-General, of welcoming you a few months ago in our country, Palestine, where you observed and witnessed first-hand the tragedy of the Palestinian people and the suffering they endure as a result of the continuing Israeli occupation of our homeland, Palestine. It is my hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you in the future under better circumstances: on the day when the occupation has been terminated and Palestine has been restored its freedom. As we approach the end of the twentieth century, our world is witnessing — and all of mankind is experiencing — great changes and important events, from globalization and the problems of the international financial market to the technological revolution, satellite communications and the information age. All of the rapid changes that have rocked our contemporary world require the necessary enhancement of our collective work within the framework of the United Nations. This should be done on the basis of the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the bolstering of international cooperation in various arenas and for the acceleration of the North13 South dialogue in order to establish a better world where peace, justice and prosperity for all mankind prevail. Many of the difficult and complicated tasks in this regard have been forced upon us and we must deal with them effectively. We have before us the task of economic and social development — particularly that of the countries of the third world — solving the debt crisis and the problems of poverty, famine, disease and migration in Asia, Africa and Latin America. These challenges require the attainment of international comprehensive measures and equitable relations that are more rational and more just. Many global problems — such as terrorism, drugs, epidemics and organized crime — require strengthening the rule of international law, as well as the establishment of the necessary institutions and mechanisms within the framework of the United Nations. In this connection, we also welcome the adoption of the Statute of the International Criminal Court, which is an important step in the promotion of law and in putting an end to atrocities and crimes against humanity. All of these challenges and responsibilities should not prevent us from recalling that many of the basic tasks of the international community in our contemporary world have not yet been accomplished. There are peoples who still remain under foreign occupation — including our Palestinian people, who have been and continue to be exposed to one of the gravest injustices. This great people did not commit a crime; they did not commit aggression against anyone nor did they occupy the land of any other people. However, they were the victims of aggression. Their land was occupied and they were dispersed and compelled by military force to a life in diaspora and exile. There are still 4 million Palestinian refugees living in camps awaiting the realization of international justice and the implementation of resolutions of international legitimacy to accord them justice and put an end to more than half a century of the tragedy of living in exile as refugees. It is also necessary to exert more effort to resolve many of the regional conflicts and problems — including, of course, those in the Middle East; in the Balkan region, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina; in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Special efforts and additional resources are necessary to solve the problems of the African continent in order to allow that great continent to move forward on the path of development and progress. These should include seeking to restore normal conditions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and achieving peace and stability in the Great Lakes region and the Horn of Africa. It is also important to consider the issue of sanctions because of its terrible and destructive effects on peoples and on neighbouring States. Here I refer specifically to Iraq, Libya and Sudan. While we call for solutions to these problems and the lifting of sanctions on the basis of the implementation of Security Council resolutions, we cannot but express the feeling of many of us concerning the use of double standards in implementing this principle. In this regard, I would like to express our satisfaction with the progress that has been achieved, in particular with regard to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. Finally, I turn to an extremely important question: the question of nuclear disarmament, weapons of mass destruction and non-proliferation. While strongly supporting the goals of the international community in this regard, we refer in particular to the immense problem existing in our region of the possession by Israel of such weapons, and its refusal to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and place its nuclear installations under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The small size of our region and its nature exacerbate the dangers stemming from the continuation of this situation. What occurred recently in South Asia must encourage us all towards sincere cooperation and a commitment to the application of one standard with regard to this issue. In order to accomplish all of these things, we need a United Nations that is more effective. We support the efforts exerted by many States and the efforts of the Secretary-General in this regard. At the same time, we feel and believe that our goal must go beyond reducing expenditures, downsizing the Secretariat, streamlining the General Assembly and expanding the Security Council, though all of these are important issues. Our goal must go beyond that to achieve the complete democratization of this global Organization. In this context, it is necessary to enhance the role of the General Assembly and also to find solutions to the veto question in the Security Council, particularly its frequent and excessive use. Transparency and clear rules of procedure must prevail in the Council. At this juncture, I should like to remind the Assembly that since 1973 our question has been subjected to 21 vetoes in the Security Council by one of the permanent members of the Council, the most recent of which occurred in a period of less than two weeks. In short, it is necessary to secure for all Members of the United Nations the ability to contribute effectively on the basis of mutual respect. 14 Last May, the Palestinian people commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of Al-Nakba, the dispossession and the suffering of the Palestinian people. Despite all of these bitter years, the oldest and largest refugee question in our contemporary world remains unresolved, and our land still suffers under occupation and colonial settlement. Its natural resources are subjected to exploitation, and the city of Al-Quds al-Sharif is still being subjected to Judaization, land confiscation, the demolition of homes, the confiscation of identity cards from its inhabitants, the imposition of a certain demographic composition and artificial administrative measures. There is also the isolation of the city of Bethlehem and the conflict occurring in Al-Khalil — Hebron — and the rest of the Palestinian cities. Eight million Palestinians are still being deprived of their right to exercise sovereignty over their land, a right that the rest of the peoples of the world enjoy. Despite all of this, despite the long and grave suffering and pain, and with long and legendary steadfastness, our Palestinian people have been able to survive and preserve their national identity. Our people chose the peace option and accepted the will of the international community in this regard. Accordingly, we decided with our Arab brothers to participate in the peace process, which began in Madrid in 1991. Then we took the well-known historical step leading to the Oslo agreement with Israel, which was signed at the White House in Washington, D.C., under the auspices of President Clinton, on 13 September 1993. That development carried the promise of an historic reconciliation and coexistence between the two peoples, the prospect of a new Middle East and the beginning of the establishment of a comprehensive and permanent peace in the region. Indeed, all parties realized tangible achievements, and the Palestinian people were able to start building their institutions and dealing with the destructive consequences of the long years of occupation. In particular, they held general and democratic elections and established the Palestinian National Authority. Despite all of the difficulties that confronted the process, the general trend to forward progress continued, until the peace process was dealt a severe blow by the assassination of the late Yitzhak Rabin, my partner in the peace process — the peace of the brave — by an Israeli extremist. This was followed by other blows resulting from the bombings and the grave deterioration of the living conditions of our people and deliberate acts to destroy the peace. When the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu took office in Israel, a new chapter began with its adoption of general political guidelines that were not consistent with the existing agreements. The Government publicly tried to discard the principles of the peace process — Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978) and the principle of land for peace. It ceased implementation of the existing agreements with the exception of the redeployment in Al-Khalil, which was achieved only after intensive American efforts. The Israeli Government continued to prevaricate and refrained from honouring the obligations of the transitional period, which are of great importance to our people, including the safe passage between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the airport, the seaport; the release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli prisons, and the industrial zones. Neither the first stage of redeployment, which was supposed to begin on 7 March 1997, nor the second stage, which was supposed to begin on 7 September 1997, were effected. Both of these, along with the third redeployment — the deadline for which has also been missed since the middle of this year — should have led to the withdrawal of the Israeli army from 90 per cent of our land. Moreover, this Government’s policies of economic suffocation, closure and direct oppression of our people — which costs us about $10 million a day — constitute an economic catastrophe. The Government has continued with the intensification of settlements and the Judaization of Jerusalem, the isolation of Bethlehem and the old city of Al-Khalil, and the disapproval of the operation of the Palestinian airport, safe passage, industrial zones and the seaport, in order to escalate the suffocation and siege of our people and to destroy the peace process. All of these policies and positions adopted by the Government of Mr. Netanyahu have caused the current dangerous situation and the complete stalemate in the peace process on the Palestinian track, as well as on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, which have been completely stalemated. These policies and positions have also engendered the general tension prevailing in the region and the danger of descending into complete chaos. The whole world has expressed grave concern at this and has called upon the Israeli side to change its policies and positions and to comply with the bases of the peace process and implement the existing agreements. It is high time for the international community, in adherence with international law and in service to peace, to effectively and tangibly pressure the Israeli side to realize the goals of peace, security and stability — not only in the Middle East but internationally. This means implementing the agreements that were signed at the White House under the auspices of President Clinton by the Russian Federation, the United States of America, the European Union, Norway, Egypt and Jordan and in the presence of Japan. It means implementing Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978) and the principle of land for peace, which were the bases of the Madrid Peace Conference. With the hope of halting the deterioration of the existing situation, the Palestinian side, in cooperation with many of the concerned parties, has recently sought to intensify efforts, particularly with the help of the United States co-sponsor — and especially with the help of President Clinton, to whom we express our gratitude. These efforts resulted in the United States initiative, containing all of the important pending issues, that was submitted to the parties concerned. As delegates are aware, the Palestinian side accepted this American initiative despite the fact that it did not meet our minimum just and legitimate demands. But the Israeli side still rejects this initiative and continues in its attempts to undermine it and pre-empt its contents. President Clinton, thankfully, sent Secretary of State Albright and Mr. Dennis Ross, who have made great efforts to move the peace process forward and protect it. Despite all these efforts, the Israeli Government has not responded. Hence, we call upon the United States cosponsor to announce its initiative and to publicly and clearly put the onus on the party that is impeding peace. We also call upon the United States to continue to work effectively in a manner consistent with its responsibilities to the peace process and with its interests and credibility in the Middle East region, and so as to protect the region from the dangers emanating from the destruction of the peace process. This morning, President Clinton graciously took an important step to save the peace process and to move it forward by convening a meeting at the White House between the Palestinian and Israeli delegations. This was an important meeting to promote and preserve the peace process, and we thank President Clinton for that, particularly as the efforts of the United States will continue to move the process forward and promote the implementation of the signed agreements. In this context we call upon the other parties concerned, particularly the Russian Federation in its capacity as one of the two co-sponsors of the peace process, as well as China and Japan, to activate and intensify their efforts. We also call upon the European Union, with its economic and political interests and capabilities, to move quickly and effectively to salvage and safeguard the peace process. In this same vein, we call upon all Member States to support the FrenchEgyptian initiative to convene an international conference of all States determined to save the peace process from the dangerous crisis it has reached. We have not lost hope for the peace process, and we will continue to honour our obligations in accordance with the existing agreements. At the same time, we will not give up on the necessity of Israeli compliance with those agreements and the need for the Israelis to fulfil their pending obligations. We will not give up our inalienable national rights — the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people. At this stage, I wish to extend, on behalf of the Palestinian people, our deep gratitude to all the donor countries and to the World Bank for their valuable contributions aimed at alleviating the suffering of our people and at assisting them in building and developing their homeland and at achieving meaningful economic and social development. I reiterate our gratitude to these countries and the World Bank, particularly because they are contributing despite the obstacles and impediments imposed by Israel in this regard. It is so difficult to separate the United Nations from the question of Palestine, for this international Organization has been dealing with our cause since its inception. It was the United Nations which partitioned Palestine, and to this time it has not ceased to deal with the results of the events that followed, with the repeated and increasing injustices perpetrated against our people, for which no remedy has yet been found. While reaffirming the permanent responsibility of the United Nations for the question of Palestine, we appeal to all of you to enhance your solidarity and support for our people in the coming period, through these critical circumstances, on the basis of respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter, international law and international humanitarian law. We expect that the Conference of the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 will be convened before the end of this year on measures to apply the Convention to the occupied Palestinian territory, including Al-Quds al-Sharif, in accordance with the recommendations made repeatedly by the tenth emergency special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. 16 In this context, we also expect Israeli participation in the work of the fifty-third session of the Assembly to be in conformity with international law, thus ensuring that Israeli credentials do not cover those territories determined by the Security Council and the General Assembly, since 1967, as occupied Palestinian and Arab territories, including occupied East Jerusalem. This is a matter on which there is a consensus by the international community. From this venue, I would like to call upon all of you, the source of international legitimacy and peacemaking, the guardian of freedom, security and stability and the source for the achievement of justice and prosperity for humankind, to stand by our people, especially as the fiveyear transitional period provided for in the PalestinianIsraeli agreements will end on 4 May 1999. Our people demand that we shoulder our responsibilities, and they await the establishment of their independent State. This independent Palestinian State must be established as an embodiment of the right of our people to self-determination. I assure you that our people will continue to pursue and protect the peace of the brave in the Middle East. We appeal to you to continue your support for us, as always in the decisive moments of the history, the present and the future of our people. Help us to achieve the national goal of our people in the establishment of their State. It is not admissible for Israel to continue dominating the Palestinian people. Everyone is aware that 100 per cent peace means 100 per cent security and 100 per cent freedom. One hundred per cent freedom. I repeat — 100 per cent peace, 100 per cent security and 100 per cent freedom. One hundred per cent freedom. If the Israeli Government wants reciprocity, I declare from this podium my demand of them for mutual compliance with the signed agreements, especially in the fields of security and the protection of Palestinians and Israelis against all forms of violence and terrorism and its sources. I invite the Israeli Government to engage in common, serious work between us to address that. There is no alternative to peace. Help us to achieve it. In the year 2000, the past and the future will meet in Palestine, joined by a global vision of hope and peace for all peoples of the world. On that occasion, the world will celebrate the second millennium of the birth of Jesus Christ — peace be upon him — and the beginning of a new millennium. It is a religious and spiritual occasion of great importance not only for the Palestinian people and the region, but also for all the believers in the world, as well as for the entire international community. The Palestinian people have actually begun serious preparations to celebrate this important religious, historic and international occasion, with the cooperation of many religious, political and social institutions concerned. We call upon you to join us in bearing the responsibility of these preparations, and we invite you to participate directly in the forthcoming celebrations to start together, God willing, a new march. In this regard, we appreciate the addition by the General Assembly of a new item on its agenda entitled “Bethlehem 2000”. We also extend our thanks to the Chairman and members of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People for their initiative in this regard. I also take this opportunity to thank its sister Committee, the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People. I look forward to speaking to you once more when Palestine will have taken its natural place in the community of nations, as an independent State, and when peace will have prevailed in the land of peace and in the entire Middle East. The light of human existence is kindled by man's longing for salvation. The essence of the message of divine prophets and the content of the teachings of prominent sages have been primarily aimed at human salvation. It is painful to observe in the arena of human history the deprivation and abject misery of human beings; the deprivation of women, men and children enslaved by the whims of the ruling powers; and the ill fate of rulers deprived of compassion and sympathy for their own nations. Hence, virtuous rule and good governance have been evanescent in human history. Ironically, much too often will and freedom of thought have been frustrated and liberty suffocated in the name of salvation, and much too often salvation has been portrayed as disposing of any and all restraints on insatiable human desires. Reason and love have thus been sacrificed at the altar of the whim. At times, liberty has been trampled in the name of justice, and at other times justice has been obliterated in the name of freedom. The result has been humanityâs age-old deprivation from both justice in liberty and liberty in justice. It is only a few centuries since genuine knowledge began to be construed as the source of power rather than an agent of its control. Ever since, knowledge, instead of serving human salvation and exalting human character, has been used as an instrument in the hands of those whose only object is to advance their own narrow, utilitarian self-interest. Despite its magnificent progress, humanity has suffered massively over these centuries from discrimination and anguish. Survivors are still among us who can testify to the incalculable destruction caused by the two world wars, and despite the birth of the United Nations â€” a positive achievement for mankind â€” true peace based on justice still remains a scarcity. Particularly desperate is the situation of the countries in the underdeveloped world, where so many still suffer from famine, illiteracy and disease, and some remain at the mercy of rulers who do not even take the trouble of pretending to respect democratic standards or enjoy popular support. So often they attempt to replace the absence of popular support by dependence on power whose sole purpose is the pursuit of domination and self- interest. Oppressive and dependent governments deny their people the opportunity to experience democracy by perpetuating intimidation and terror in society, and they 3 promote a culture of violence which inadvertently leads their opponents to resort to the same. The powers that breed and nurture such regimes can therefore not escape blame. Primarily responsible here are those powers whose intelligence services take pride in their dark record of overthrowing popular governments and supporting unpopular ones. This image of our world is indeed grim and repulsive. Until the day that the wise and the learned wrest the reins of power from the unwise and the capricious, this image cannot at all be transformed. Nonetheless, in my opinion, beyond the darkness and doom, genuine beauty can still be discerned in the deeper layers of history. I can assert with certitude that, on the whole, human life has blossomed spiritually and materially. Anti-colonial struggles and independence movements of many nations in this century exemplify this blossoming and progress. The collapse of the bipolar world order in the final decade of this century and the swift march of the world towards diversity, coupled with renewed assertion of identity in the international arena by nations demanding equality, are other significant achievements in this direction. The fantasy of a unipolar world ruled by a single super-Power is but an illusion, indicating the failure of its holders to keep pace with history. I am confident that powerful nations, such as the American people, will not accept that their good name, potential and national prestige be exploited for the advancement of the dream of a unipolar world by the politicians, motivated by the short- sighted material and factional interests of a few. The evolution of public opinion in the West in support of peaceful relations on the basis of mutual respect testifies to this assertion. Now allow me to speak here as a man from the East, the origin of brilliant civilizations and the birthplace of divine prophets â€” Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Mohammed, peace be upon them all. I come from the noble land of Iran, representing a great and renowned nation famed for its ancient civilization, as well as for its distinguished contribution to the founding and expansion of the Islamic civilization, a nation that has survived the strong winds of despotism, reaction and submission, relying on its cultural and human wealth. It is a nation which pioneered in the East the establishment of civil society and constitutional government in the course of its contemporary history, even though, as a result of foreign interference and domestic deficiencies, at times it may have faltered in its course; a nation which has been at the forefront of the struggle for independence and against colonialism, although its national movement was subverted by a foreign- orchestrated coup. And it is a nation which carries the torch of its popular revolution, not won by force of arms or a coup, but by dethroning a regime of coup dâÃ©tat through the power of the enlightened word. In the course of its new experience, our nation has endured eight years of an imposed war, pressure, sanctions and various unfair accusations. It has also fallen victim to terrorism, the ominous phenomenon of the twentieth century. Today, the Iranian nation draws on its past to contemplate a better future, while defying reactionary tendencies and, backed by principles and ideals rooted in its religious, national, historical and revolutionary heritage and benefiting from positive achievements of contemporary civilization, marches, be it through trial and error, towards a promising tomorrow. The Islamic revolution of the Iranian people was a revolt of reason against coercion and suppression. Certainly, a revolution which resorted to logic in the phase of destruction is much better disposed to resort to dialogue and reason in the phase of construction. Hence, it calls for a dialogue among civilizations and cultures instead of a clash between them. From this rostrum and the pulpit of the United Nations, I announce that humanity, despite all calamities and hardships, is heading towards emancipation and liberty. This is the unalterable divine providence and human destiny. The malice and depravity of no individual can ever violate divine providence and the course of history. The word â€œhistoryâ€ predates â€œphilosophyâ€, and man is the pillar of history. History itself is the reflection of the light of being upon various facets and dimensions of human existence. Thus, it is a unique and universal entity, albeit diverse in nature. Whenever this unique entity takes on a new guise, a new era is ushered in. Our assessment of history indeed emanates from our perception of humanity â€” its pivot and pillar. Human beings, who, in the Persian poet Saadiâs eloquent description borrowed from a saying of the holy Prophet of Islam, are various organs of the same body, are outside the reach of biology or psychology. Understanding human beings requires a philosophical and reflective view of man and history. God created man with His own hand and in His own image, and He breathed into him of His own spirit, and thus humanity is but a 4 single entity, and so is its history. The hand of God granted humankind history, will and freedom of choice; the image of God provided him culture, spirituality and liberty; and the spirit of God bestowed upon him life and vitality. Thus, human beings have come to possess history, culture and liberty. Not only do all human beings originate from one and the same origin and share a continuous and integrated history, but also one may further postulate a single final purpose. This purpose of history is none other than spiritual culture, and genuine human liberty is its absolute prerequisite. Whether or not one subscribes to the view that man is doomed to whirl in iterative historical cycles or to grapple with historical moments or epochs, and whether or not one holds history to be self-driven, driven by human urges, by modes of production or by superhuman heroes, everyone can agree that it is only the ever-inspiring fountain of faith that breaks every old and new shackle from humanity and arrests the iterative eternal cycle, eventually emancipating humankind from the bounds of historical determinism, just as it is only the vivifying breeze of liberty that can offer faith and spirituality to humanity. It is thus that humankind could, in consonance with the mystic Persian poet Hafez, serenade that â€œI will subvert this high inverted vault if it should ere rotate 'gainst my dictate.â€ Or, in the words of the Gospel according to Saint Mark, if one had faith in God one could say to the mountain â€œBe thou removed, and be thou cast into the seaâ€ (The Holy Bible, Mark 11:23) Through such an understanding of freedom, the tenets of human dignity can be upheld in the face of political domination and virtue, and hope against baneful blasts of despair and nihilism. Here, one can discern the trajectory of history towards liberty. The history of humankind is the history of liberty. Only that interpretation which describes history as the arena for manifestation of liberty can provide an opening of the past for the benefit of mankind. Regardless of all philosophical systems that have attempted to attribute meanings, directions and laws of evolution to history, we can realize that because human history is intertwined with the history of liberty, when human beings are liberated from imposed constraints of exploitation and social enslavement, as well as from unrefined animal instincts such as violence and savagery, they will then side with truth and justice in line with their human nature. Thence, human history shall become the glorious history of truth and realization of justice. And this could be another expression of the famous religious doctrine of Messianism. Whether we embark on an empirical and inductive study of history or an intuitive one, most thinkers would agree that the essence of humanity has flourished and that more veils of ignorance have been removed from the minds of human beings. I have deliberately used the word â€œflourishedâ€ instead of the more common terms, such as â€œhistorical progressâ€, in order to emphasize that, whatever school of philosophy of history we may follow, we can still share an understanding of this general and universal conception of history. The establishment and continued functioning of the United Nations is a testament to the progressive path of the world and of human history. Today it does not require much argument to establish that instead of war and bloodshed one could and indeed ought to resort to discourse and dialogue. That fact has not been achieved easily, as if the bloodstained history of humanity forms an antecedent to this seemingly simple proposition. Yet so long as imprudent potentates can obliterate flowers and trees, hope and mirth from the face of the Earth with a quick stroke of their folly and cruelty, it is premature to celebrate the ultimate triumph of the Logos over the sword. The twentieth century did not only witness the manifestations of violence and human sufferings at the hands of old colonialists and the unprecedented injustice of their modern heirs; it was also the century of the rise and fall of totalitarian regimes. Let us hope that in the coming century resort to force and violence shall not be glorified and that the essence of political power shall be compassion and justice, externally manifested in dialogue between civilizations. The question is how the United Nations may take the necessary measures to respond to this evolving global climate, and what impact it will have on the changing course of the life of mankind longing for salvation. 5 I would like to propose, in the name of the Islamic Republic of Iran, that the United Nations, as a first step, designate the year 2001 as the â€œYear of Dialogue Among Civilizationsâ€, in the earnest hope that through such a dialogue the realization of universal justice and liberty may be initiated. Among the worthiest achievements of this century is the acceptance of the necessity and significance of dialogue and the rejection of force, the promotion of understanding in the cultural, economic and political fields, and the strengthening of the foundations of liberty, justice and human rights. The establishment and enhancement of civility, whether at the national or international level, is contingent upon dialogue among societies and civilizations representing various views, inclinations and approaches. If humanity, at the threshold of the new century and millennium, devotes all its efforts to institutionalizing dialogue, replacing hostility and confrontation with discourse and understanding, it will leave an invaluable legacy for the benefit of future generations. Similarly, it is necessary that as members of the United Nations we revisit the history of the formation of this Organization, with a view to reforming and improving the institution through a rational exchange of views. The United Nations took shape in a dark era of human history, when many of its current members were still experiencing the bitter and abominable conditions of colonial rule. As a consequence, the new Organization reflected the domination of the powerful few. Things have changed now, and the opportunity has presented itself to restructure this Organization, particularly its Security Council. Here I would like to refer to the wise statement of the leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran in his inaugural address to the Eighth Session of the Islamic Summit Conference, held in Tehran, that the Islamic countries, representing one billion and several hundred million people, should acquire a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council, with the same privileges as current permanent members, as long as they are enjoyed by those members. The time has come to reject, through understanding, the discriminatory veto privilege, and in so doing take another step towards the recognition of fair and equal rights of all Member States. Let us all join hands in solidarity against genocide, aggression and the humiliation of mankind in various corners of the world. Let us prevent the continuation of shameful tragedies which have tarnished the face of this century in Palestine, Afghanistan and Kosovo, and in many other parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Peace and security in the Middle East, imperative as they are, will only be established through the recognition of the right of all Palestinians to exercise sovereignty over their ancestral homeland. The presently occupied Al-Quds al-Sharif ought to be the house of dialogue and understanding. Resonating from the depth of history, its voice speaks intrinsically against racism and Zionism. Great monotheistic religions can live peacefully together in Al-Quds al-Sharif, but it is the very Israeli rule that has made such a coexistence impossible. Palestine is the home of all Palestinians â€” Muslims, Christians and Jews â€” and not a laboratory for the violent whims of Zionists. In Afghanistan, there is no military solution to that countryâs predicament. The universal outrage at the massacre and genocide being perpetrated there â€” particularly the tragic killing of Iranian diplomats and a journalist, as well as at the continued captivity of the Iranian aid workers in the hands of the Taliban â€” calls for sober analysis and expeditious action to bring the perpetrators of these crimes to justice. Afghanistan, the land of people of dignity and culture, has now been turned into a haven for violence, terrorism and the production of and trafficking in narcotics. The Afghan people, as other peoples in the world, have the inalienable right to determine their own destiny and the right to enjoy a broad-based Government representing all ethnic groups, communities and tendencies in that country. This is the only way to restore tranquillity in Afghanistan. This requires resolute international cooperation in order to inhibit the lucrative and deadly business of producing and smuggling narcotics, illicit trafficking in weapons and cultivation of terrorism. The United Nations, in cooperation with the Organization of the Islamic Conference and all concerned States, should bring all the parties to the conflict to the negotiating table, paving the way for the tyrannized and destitute Afghan people to freely determine their own destiny and, backed by solemn global support, should bring the rogue elements into compliance with the will of the international community. Simultaneously the Organization should plan for the mobilization of requisite international assistance for the reconstruction of Afghanistan once the necessary political conditions are in place. 6 In Kosovo, the legitimate rights of the embattled people should be recognized, and the Yugoslav Government should be made to respect these rights. Honest and sincere efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including state terrorism, constitute another important priority for the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Terrorism is a product of desperation and nihilism. In a world swirling in the orbit of violence and oppression, serious combat against terrorism will not advance beyond the realm of words and slogans. The eradication of terrorism must be concurrent with a global search for justice. This assertion should in no way be interpreted as a justification for any form of terrorism. As required by our religious, moral and cultural values and norms, we unequivocally oppose all forms and manifestations of terrorism, and we shall combat it vigorously and earnestly. In our view, in order to eradicate this menace, we should engage in serious and transparent international cooperation to combat terrorism, and at the same time redouble our efforts to attain the objective of global justice. At the threshold of the third millennium, the world also needs to be liberated from the nightmare of nuclear war and weapons of mass destruction. Recent nuclear tests in our region, which have led to further complications, make this all the more imperative. We should all realize that the idea of attaining security through the acquisition of such armaments is nothing but an illusion. The manifestation of a resolute global determination to eliminate all existing arsenals of weapons of mass destruction within an agreed time-frame would provide a clear objective and lend credence and add dynamism to the international efforts against the production and proliferation of these deadly weapons. The establishment of zones free from weapons of mass destruction, particularly in the Middle East, constitutes an appropriate first step in alleviating tension and mistrust emanating from these weapons. We in the Islamic Republic of Iran, as victims of the use of weapons of mass destruction, are more cognizant than anyone else of their horrifying impact. We shall thus stay at the forefront of international efforts to establish and strengthen universal arrangements for their destruction. Security, development and prosperity in the third world require the promotion of cooperation and the utilization of proven arrangements and mechanisms for confidence-building. In this regard, it is encouraging that the Eighth Islamic Summit Conference in Tehran, cognizant of this necessity, established an appropriate mechanism to foster confidence through dialogue among Islamic countries. As a first step in this direction, I invite our neighbours in the Persian Gulf region, who have witnessed two destructive wars in the span of one decade, to establish a security and cooperation system in the area. In short, confidence and peace cannot be attained without a sober revision of the mentality of the cold war. The advancement and promotion of a culture of peace is contingent upon the recognition of the constructive role of nations coupled with avoidance of domination, unilateralism, confrontation and exclusion. The Islamic Republic of Iran, in keeping with its fundamental beliefs and deep-rooted heritage of civilization, seeks a world blessed with peace and tranquillity based on human dignity. It has accorded the highest priority in its foreign policy to the removal of tension. In line with the principles of the Islamic revolution, Iran is determined to follow its balanced policy of expanding relations with its neighbours and other countries on the basis of respect for independence and equality of rights. Comprehensive peace, over and above peace among human beings, also calls for peace between mankind and nature, which in turn requires that mankind bring to a halt the systematic devouring of nature and instead emphasizes the coordination of man and nature. The preservation of the environment, as the common natural heritage of mankind, constitutes a most important priority of the coming century. Before concluding, I would like to emphasize the paramount role of the family, women and youth in the making of a better tomorrow and the consolidation of the foundations of civil society throughout the globe. The family is the unique setting for human progress and the development of the personal and social identity of individuals. Regrettably, today, especially in the industrialized countries, the foundations of home and family have been undermined, threatening the emotional, material and spiritual health of human life. A global effort is required to confront this danger, lest the flames of this centre of warmth, affection and education be gradually dimmed by the cold and vicious winds of alluring facades, lust and material gain. 7 Efforts at the global level geared to the promotion and strengthening of respect for women and their rights require a critical reassessment of the traditional and inappropriate views about women. The traditional outlook, based on the erroneous notion of the superiority of men over women, does injustice to men, women and humanity as a whole. Equally nefarious is the view that disregards the differences between men and women. We should recognize that both men and women are valuable components of humanity who equally possess the potential for intellectual, social, cultural and political development, and that comprehensive and sustainable development is possible only through the active participation of both men and women in social life. At the threshold of the new millennium, the United Nations should have faith in the new generation, to whom the next century belongs. It should thus be prepared to accept and embrace the requirements of believing in youth. Let us bring ourselves to accept that we are not custodians of youth and that the young do have the right to enjoy the social process of growth and development, a right they should exercise consciously and wilfully. With such a new perspective, and drawing upon the dynamic ability and intellectual capability of the new generation, we can together chart a much better and brighter future for the next century.  I congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. We wish you well in our shared endeavours in the United Nations and offer you our full cooperation. We would like to thank your predecessor for his commitment and contribution, and to commend him for his work throughout the last year. I first addressed the Assembly as Foreign Minister in 1977. Since then I have for many years had the privilege to attend General Assembly sessions, but without ministerial responsibility. I acknowledge with gratitude the confidence of successive Prime Ministers. To me, this also signifies the consensus on the national interests and the foreign policy of India. When I addressed the General Assembly in 1977, it was in many ways a turning point in the history of India. The Janata Government was a coalition of many factions, which united in the restoration of our people?s faith in democracy. Since then we have had many changes of Government, but the people?s political awareness and their faith in the institutions which uphold our constitutional system has been unwavering. Today, when I come to this rostrum as Prime Minister, I come on behalf of another coalition. India has demonstrated that democracy can take root in a developing country. I am confident that the Indian experience will prove that democracy can also provide the basis for stable, long-term economic growth in developing societies. That is the path that the people of India have chosen, and I stand before the Assembly today as the symbol of this new resurgent India. 16 The world of the 1970s has receded into history. The shackling constraints of the cold war are gone. The distinguishing feature of the last two decades has been the spread of democracy worldwide. By force of example, we have been one of the authors of the triumph of democracy. From this flows our desire to see the democratization of the United Nations itself. An international body that does not reflect, and change with, changing international realities will inevitably face a credibility deficit. We therefore support a revitalized and more effective United Nations, one that is more responsive to the concerns of the vast majority of its Member States and is better equipped to meet the challenges that are ahead of us in the twenty-first century. The Security Council does not represent contemporary reality; it does not represent democracy in international relations. Following the end of the cold war, it acquired the freedom to act, but experience shows that the Council has acted only when it was convenient for its permanent members. The experience of Somalia does not do credit to the Security Council — and there are other examples too. Peacekeeping operations cannot be a reflection of ulterior political priorities and perceptions. There is only one cure: to bring in new blood. The Security Council must be made representative of the membership of the United Nations. Developing countries must be made permanent members. This is a right to which the developing world is entitled. The presence of some developing countries as permanent members is inescapable if the responsibilities of the Security Council are to be effectively discharged, particularly when we see that the Council acts almost exclusively in the developing world. It is only natural that on decisions affecting the developing world, these countries should have a say, on equal terms. Along with other measures, the Security Council too must be reformed, expanding its non-permanent membership so that more developing countries can serve on it. But that alone is not enough, because as long as effective power in the Council rests with the permanent membership, the interests of the developing world will not be promoted or protected unless developing countries are made permanent members on a par with the present permanent members. Only this will make the Council an effective instrument for the international community in dealing with current and future challenges. The new permanent members must of course have the ability to discharge the responsibilities that come with permanent membership. India believes it has that ability, and, as we have said before from this rostrum, we are prepared to accept the responsibilities of permanent membership, and believe we are qualified for it. It will be a great day when democracy becomes the universal norm, and when the United Nations reflects that democracy in its institutions and functioning. However, open democratic societies have one scourge to contend with: terrorism. The challenge before countries like mine and other democracies is to maintain our openness, safeguard individual rights, and at the same time give no quarter to terrorists. Several speakers before me have recounted the terrible toll that terrorists have exacted worldwide, taking advantage of the trust that characterizes open societies. I recall that the Group of Seven summit almost two decades back identified terrorism as one of the most serious threats to civilized societies. Events since then, including the blowing up of the Air India Kanishka aircraft and the Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, and the recent bombings in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, have only established the correctness of that judgement. Terrorism is one threat that affects us all equally. Terrorism takes a daily toll around the world. It is the most vicious among international crimes, and the most pervasive, pernicious and ruthless threat to the lives of men and women in open societies, and to international peace and security. In India, we have had to cope with terrorism aided and abetted by a neighbouring country for nearly two decades. We have borne this with patience, but none should doubt the strength of our resolve to crush this challenge. Its tentacles have spread around the world. Today, it has links with illicit trade in drugs and arms and with money-laundering. In short, terrorism has gone global and it can only be defeated by organized international action. Let us make up our minds once and for all: terrorism is a crime against humanity. Unilateral steps can hardly stand scrutiny in an open society, let alone in the eyes of the international community. It should be the primary task of all open and pluralist societies to develop collective means for tackling this menace. At its summit meeting in Durban, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries called for an international conference in 1999 to develop such a collective response. We earnestly recommend that the 1999 conference launch the process of negotiations on an international convention to provide for collective action 17 against States and organizations which initiate or aid and abet terrorism. Now, at the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, there is a growing realization that economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights form a seamless web. Analyses carried out in recent years by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees amply reflect the vicious cycle of how violations of economic, social and cultural rights inevitably lead to violations of civil and political rights. In defining its index, the Human Development Report gives a higher weighting to economic criteria for developing countries; this weighting is reduced for developed countries, highlighting the importance of the right to development for developing societies. It is therefore a matter of concern that the absolutism that some are seeking to advocate in the promotion of human rights is often at the cost of the right to development. India has ratified both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Other institutions in our country — the National Human Rights Commission, a free media and an independent judiciary — all serve to ensure that the rights set out in international human rights statutes are enjoyed by all citizens. We also remain convinced that unless progress is made on economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development, the world will continue to witness international conflict leading to migrations, displacement of people and human rights abuses. In the closing years of the twentieth century, the challenge of nuclear disarmament is another of the priorities facing the international community. We have successfully prohibited chemical and biological weapons in recent decades. The present century has witnessed the development and the tragic use of nuclear weapons. We must ensure that the legacy of this weapon of mass destruction is not carried into the next century. For the last half-century, India has consistently pursued the objectives of international peace, along with equal and legitimate security for all through global disarmament. These concepts are among the basic tenets of our national security. India has, over the years, sought to enhance its national security by promoting global nuclear disarmament, convinced that a world free of nuclear weapons would enhance both global security and India?s national security. The negotiations on a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty (CTBT) began in 1993 with a mandate that such a treaty would contribute effectively to the non- proliferation of nuclear weapons in all aspects, to the process of nuclear disarmament and, therefore, to the enhancement of international peace and security. India participated actively and constructively in the negotiations, and sought to place the Treaty in a disarmament framework by proposing its linkage with a time-bound programme for the universal elimination of all nuclear weapons. It is a matter of history that India?s proposals were not accepted. The Treaty, as it emerged, was not accepted by India on grounds of national security. We made explicit our objection that, despite our stand having been made clear, the Treaty text made India?s signature and ratification a precondition for its entry into force. Mindful of its deteriorating security environment, which obliged us to stand apart from the CTBT in 1996, India undertook a limited series of five underground tests, conducted on 11 and 13 May 1998. These tests were essential for ensuring a credible nuclear deterrent for India?s national security in the foreseeable future. These tests do not signal a dilution of India?s commitment to the pursuit of global nuclear disarmament. Accordingly, after concluding this limited testing programme, India announced a voluntary moratorium on further underground nuclear test explosions. We conveyed our willingness to move towards a de jure formalization of that obligation. In announcing a moratorium, India has already accepted the basic obligation of the CTBT. In 1996, India could not have accepted the obligation, as such a restraint would have eroded our capability and compromised our national security. India, having harmonized its national imperatives and security obligations and desirous of continuing to cooperate with the international community, is now engaged in discussions with key interlocutors on a range of issues, including the CTBT. We are prepared to bring these discussions to a successful conclusion, so that the entry into force of the CTBT is not delayed beyond September 1999. We expect that other countries, as indicated in article XIV of the Treaty, will adhere to it without conditions. After protracted discussions, the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva is now in a position to begin negotiations on a treaty that will prohibit the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons or other nuclear 18 explosive devices. Once again, we are conscious that this is a partial step. Such a treaty, as and when it is concluded and enters into force, will not eliminate existing nuclear arsenals. Yet we will participate in these negotiations in good faith in order to ensure a treaty that is non- discriminatory and meets India?s security imperatives. India will pay serious attention to any other multilateralinitiatives in this area during the course of the negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament. As a responsible State committed to non-proliferation, India has undertaken that it shall not transfer these weapons or related know-how to other countries. We have an effective system of export controls and shall make it more stringent where necessary, including by expanding control lists of equipment and technology to make them more contemporary and effective in the context of a nuclear India. At the same time, as a developing country, we are conscious that nuclear technology has a number of peaceful applications, and we shall continue to cooperate actively with other countries in this regard, in keeping with our international responsibilities. A few weeks ago, at the Non-Aligned Summit in Durban, India proposed, and the Movement agreed, that an international conference be held, preferably in 1999, with the objective of arriving at an agreement before the end of this millennium on a phased programme for the complete elimination of all nuclear weapons. I call upon all members of the international community, and particularly the other nuclear-weapon States, to join in this endeavour. Let us pledge that when we assemble here in the new millennium it will be to welcome the commitment that mankind shall never again be subjected to the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. The decade of the 1990s has fallen far short of expectations. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the global economic scene. The sense of triumphalism that heralded the wave of global capitalism is now giving way to caution and realism. What was initially seen as an Asian flu is now spreading to other continents. The hypothesis that unfettered capital flows would foster economic development, with the global financial markets adjusting the exchange rates, stands falsified. What we have seen is the growth of a large volume of “virtual money” that has not been generated by productive economic activity. But the power of the “virtual money” is real, evident in the fact that national regulatory mechanisms are unable to cope with the impact of its rapid movement in and out of currencies. Its volatility in the short run follows not economic logic but rumour and sentiment, with results that are self-reinforcing. In developing countries and in western financial capitals, there is now a growing acceptance that premature liberalization of capital markets has been a primary cause of the current crisis. Does it mean that the world should turn back from globalization? Our answer is an emphatic “No”. Rising economic interdependence is a phenomenon driven by the technological imperative, but we must learn how to manage the change. India has not been affected as severely as some other countries, largely because we adopted policies that were more prudent. But a drop in commodity prices by 30 per cent in a year and a reduction in net capital flows to the emerging markets by 50 per cent will have a negative impact on growth everywhere, including in the developed world. I must emphasize that democratically elected leadership in an open developing society such as India also faces another challenge. We cannot let an unbridled free market system aggravate existing economic and social disparities. In fact, we need policy instruments to reduce disparities, thus creating a more stable environment in the long term. Such policies are necessary in accountable democracies and are in no way inconsistent with managed liberalization. It is high time that we begin a new international dialogue on the future of a global and interdependent economy. This is a task for the sovereign States represented here and cannot be left solely to the dynamics of an unregulated market place. I think I speak for all of us when I say that we are on the threshold of a new age. This is an overused phrase, but we are all aware that an exciting new universe is within our reach. Several centuries ago, Isaac Newton described his scientific discoveries as pebbles on the beach, while the ocean of truth lay undiscovered. It was modest of that great scientist to so describe his work, but I believe that we are now actually sailing in the ocean of truth. We have made exciting discoveries and will make many more which will move humankind forward. And yet there is also an uneasy feeling that all is not well. The world is not at ease with itself. In almost all parts of the world forces are bubbling under the surface tranquillity that threaten the gains of the last century and 19 seek to lead the world towards bigotry, violence and unhealthy exclusivism. India has a message — not a new one, for almost all religions have expressed the thought before. But we have preserved the tenets of freedom, equality and tolerance in our daily lives. If the world of the twenty-first century is to be a better place than the world we have seen so far, these values must prevail. History also shows that these are easier to prescribe than to observe. And yet, as we move towards ever closer interdependence, there is no alternative. The world and its leaders must summon the will to rise to the occasion and enter the new age with a new outlook. This is the task before us, and I declare India?s readiness to make its full contribution in the testing times ahead. I close with an ancient “sloka” from the Rig Ved as composed thousands of years ago in Sanskrit, the oldest language in the world: “Svastir manushebhyaha Oordhvam Jugatu beshajam Sam no astu dvipathe Sam Chathusthpate Om Shanti, Shanti, Shanti” This means: Let all human beings be blessed with prosperity. Let all flora and fauna which are life line of all creatures grow abundantly. Let there be harmony with all two-legged creations. Let there be harmony with all four- legged creations. Let there be peace, peace, peace.  I join other delegations in congratulating you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly. We are confident that your ability and experience will successfully guide our work during this session. I also wish to express our gratitude to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, whose presidency was characterized by energy and drive. Freedom first and foremost. That rallying cry has inspired peoples and nations throughout this century. It gave birth to brave acts of courage during two world conflicts. It gave sustenance in the struggle for decolonization. It gave stamina and resilience during and after the dark days of the cold war. Freedom first and foremost. That was the solid platform on which citizens worldwide stood their ground whenever authoritarian regimes sought to erode democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Freedom first and foremost. That ideal buttressed President Roosevelt in his effort to give birth to the United Nations. As we strive to build a better world and struggle to conquer the uncertainties of our times, we the peoples of the United Nations continue to cherish those four essential human freedoms identified by President Roosevelt in his speech to Congress on 6 January 1941: freedom of speech and expression — everywhere in the world; freedom of every person to worship God in his own way — everywhere in the world; freedom from want to secure for every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants — everywhere in the world; freedom from fear through a worldwide reduction of armaments so that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbour — anywhere in the world. Underlining these four freedoms, President Roosevelt stressed that they were “a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in our own time and generation”, not a “vision of a distant millennium”. For the past 53 sessions world leaders have gathered here in this General Assembly to take stock of humankind?s progress in achieving those noble aims for which the United Nations was founded. Each year brings with it new unknowns, new challenges, new tragedies. Yet each year we also see movement, in small steps or in strides, towards a more secure world. Building a world where peace, justice and freedom reign supreme is a duty for all of us who serve in public office. This responsibility becomes more onerous as we advance towards the dawning of the new millennium. Eight years ago I was privileged to serve this Assembly as its President. The future then beckoned. In 1989 the world had witnessed the collapse of the Soviet bloc. Millions had reacquired their freedom. In 1990 the idyllic aftermath of the Bush-Gorbachev Malta summit was shattered by the invasion of Kuwait. In those times of euphoric uncertainty I called on Member States to revitalize this General Assembly and ensure a symbiotic relationship between the Organization?s principal organs. The call for reform prevailed. It bore fruit and continues to give results. Reform is essential for the Organization?s well-being. It is even more essential for the future of humankind. Eight years ago I signalled the danger of a curtain of poverty dividing the world, with the same dire consequences as the Iron Curtain had on world peace and security. That danger remains and has become more pronounced. Last week the President of the United States reminded this Assembly that “the gulf is widening between the world?s haves and have-nots”. (A/53/PV.7, p. 11) Narrowing that gulf is essential if we desire a secure global society bereft of rage. That rage often transforms itself into acts of violence. The ill winds that blow at present, devastating the economies of many States and crippling progress built through the hard work of so any families around the world, further aggravate this situation. The United Nations is the unique instrument to promote and protect the universal enjoyment of human dignity. Significantly, one of the first tasks that this Organization set itself was the drafting of a Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of its adoption by this Assembly, we renew our commitment to its content. That document is not outdated, nor can it be easily replaced. It proclaims human rights that by their very nature are universal, inherent and indivisible. The Declaration is comprehensive and demands an observance that is equally comprehensive. A selective approach damages the Declaration and the wider concepts that it represents. It undermines a vision of society in which respect for human rights is paramount and universal. There is, however, a significant lack in this Declaration. It is an instrument with no judicial mechanisms or sanctions. Has the time arrived to learn from the experience of the regional human rights conventions, in particular the European Convention, which through its mechanisms instituted the European Court of Human Rights and through the right of individual petition further guarantees a judicial process aimed at ensuring effective enforcement? There can be no freedom without democracy. Equally, there can be no democracy without the exercise of individual freedoms. We underscore this reaffirmation as we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We the peoples look up to United Nations for leadership in resolving the ills of our times. Yet we the peoples are the United Nations. The United Nations is us. Attempts to project or depict the United Nations as an entity alien to the rest of the international community or as an Organization that can determine or predetermine the fate of peoples and society are both erroneous and dangerous. This Organization depends on a continuation of that balance of principles and institutions intrinsic in the Charter. This balance is best conserved by consolidating the process of consensus-building that has rendered so many positive results in the past half-century. Imposition of the will of some over the will of the others is rarely conducive to harmony in any circumstance. It is even less so in a forum of sovereign nation States. There are instances when the will of the majority traces important paths for future cooperation between States. Yet the effort to ensure the widest a priori adherence to the principles being negotiated is always essential, particularly if we desire such agreements to be universal in their application. This demands a diplomatic and political effort that may appear exasperating. Still, it is the path that best conserves the delicate balance between the sovereign rights of States and the emergence of a new world order. We have partaken of the sorrow sown by violence and war. We have survived the tensions of bloc antagonism and nuclear proliferation. We have grappled with the anguish of division and mutual suspicion. The imminence of a new millennium naturally generates hopes 2 and expectations. Foremost is the longing for the fulfilment of the promise garnered at the end of the cold war. Throughout this decade we committed ourselves, devising tools to deal with uncertainties as they emerged. Yet suffering and strife continue to plague the planet. Shocking violations imposed upon us the duty to provide future generations with an international judicial mechanism to fairly establish the guilt of the perpetrators of war crimes and provide for their punishment. We acted with the swiftness demanded by the might of right. We set the framework to deal with crimes that are an affront to humanity?s sense of justice and compassion. In Rome last July we adopted the Statute of the International Criminal Court. We thus lay the foundation for an effective and credible institution that in itself is a deterrent against the commission of heinous crimes falling under its jurisdiction. We hope that the momentum gathered in institution-building is retained to enable the Court to start functioning and effectively deal with crimes against humanity whenever they occur. Vigilance remains the order of the day. With good reason, the world proclaimed victory at the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The ratification of the latter by two of the nuclear-weapon States is a welcome and positive step. Yet pitted against these positive developments were recent nuclear tests carried out by two non-signatories. We have seen the partial dismantling of nuclear arsenals, but also witnessed the dangers of proliferation. Such actions fuel insecurity and mistrust. We join others in strongly urging these two countries, and indeed all countries, to exercise restraint. Nuclear testing is a stark reminder of the dangers ever present in nuclear weaponry. Malta welcomes the statements of intent made by the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan in this Assembly last week. They augur well for the universality of the NPT regime. No effort must be spared to ensure universal adherence to and compliance with the relevant treaties covering not only nuclear weapons but also all weapons of mass destruction. The nuclear disarmament agenda must be kept on track. The dangers that loom are not limited to the possession and use of such armaments by nuclear-weapon States. The spectre of nuclear terrorism haunts us as we combat illegal trafficking related to the possession, production and use of such weapons. The dangers remain multiple. Chemical and biological weapons pose destabilizing threats. By disturbing contrast, technologies for their acquisition and use are relatively easy to develop. Conventional arms- trafficking also remains a major menace. The establishment of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) sets out a regime of control and verification that strikes a balance, curbing proliferation of chemicals for weapons use while sanctioning beneficial use of chemicals by a wide range of industries. Malta is proud to have served on the Executive Council in its initial stage. It is our hope that the verification protocol on biological weapons may likewise hamper, discourage and disallow the use of biological components for war, conflict or conquest. Images of the maimed victims of landmines buttress our commitment to outlaw these weapons. Malta was among the first to sign the Ottawa Convention, and ratification is being processed. We join others in saluting its entry into force early next year. This brings closer the prohibition on the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and their destruction. Equally threatening, intrusive and destabilizing are international crime, drug-trafficking and terrorism. These continue to poison the very roots of our societies, spreading corruption, fear and suffering. No Government can ignore or shield itself from such phenomena. Complacency is both dangerous and unreal. United Nations efforts to further international cooperation to combat and curb these afflictions, particularly those of the Vienna Centre for International Crime Prevention, deserve our full and unwavering support. Freedom, democracy and social justice have fortunately become oft-used terms within this Organization. They are indeed the basic elements of all our efforts. They reflect the will to give substance to the Charter?s reaffirmation of fundamental human rights, the dignity and worth of the human person, and the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small. Commitment to human rights must be matched by action to promote social justice and better living standards in larger freedom. The human rights that we promote and protect must be complemented by the provision of a social safety net that preserves the dignity of all. This is a principle that the Maltese people hold dear. 3 My Government was again returned to office less than three weeks ago. The cornerstone of our agenda is the restoration of confidence and direction and the generation of wealth, to the benefit of all our people: our only and most precious resource. This demands the resumption of a strategy that invests in improving health and education services with the same vigour with which we revolutionized the social and economic infrastructures of our country. We are committed to social justice and thus to the well-being of those most vulnerable to suffering if left to their own devices in times of economic transition. The true measure of progress remains social justice that buttresses equity and personal dignity and ensures the universal enjoyment of fundamental human rights and freedoms. The change in Administration has also brought about the resumption of the march towards Europe which was briefly frozen during the previous 22 months by the previous Administration. Malta?s application for membership of the European Union has been reactivated. An overwhelming electoral mandate reconfirms the European vocation of our people, repeatedly expressed in free and fair elections during the past two decades. The choice of our people is clear, and the path we shall follow is equally clear. Our immediate objective is to rejoin those countries earmarked for the next enlargement of the Union. Though much remains to be done, the commitment of the people and the Government is deep-seated. We do not choose to be European. We are European: European in history and culture, in economic structures and political organization, in security concerns and ethical values. Anchorage in the European Union is the natural culmination of our development process, our traditions and our culture. As in any other member of the Union, debate on the benefits of membership and the consequent rights and responsibilities continues. This is an intrinsic aspect of the democratic process. Nowhere in Europe have choices been easy or straightforward, but everywhere in Europe, the freely expressed will of the people has prevailed. This is a fundamental characteristic of Europe, a political union built on respect for the individual and the democratic will of its peoples. Enlargement of the European Union to gather peoples and nations within its fold in a spirit of pluralism, solidarity and cooperation is more than just a process. It cannot be seen as just an exercise in augmenting the membership. It is much more than that. It is a political demand for the realization of the Union and its credibility in global politics. Characterized by reciprocity, it is a quest in peace-building, a venture that in less than half a century has continued to transform the founding fathers? ideal into a tangible reality. Like all other Mediterranean States, Malta views the problems of its region with particular concern. At the crossroads of cultures and civilizations, the Mediterranean is disproportionately burdened with turmoil, tension and conflict. Resolution of each crisis demands positive action by the protagonists directly responsible. Yet the world community can contribute, through its efforts and good offices, to constructing an environment conducive to negotiated settlement. The bitter heritage of the past sometimes impedes that contact which is an essential first step in the setting up of negotiating structures. In this effort to overcome obstacles, the international community and individual statesmen have given their fair share. The open wounds that still afflict the region demand renewed engagement lest they continue to fester and degenerate into volatility that would risk spilling over to broader areas. The Cyprus question has long been one of these open wounds, having political and stability repercussions that go beyond the geographic dimensions of the island itself. A solution in conformity with the resolutions of the United Nations can have enduring positive effects for all the parties concerned in the dispute. The ever pervasive problems encountered by the Middle East process are of particular concern. In spite of various efforts, this process has come to a virtual standstill. We believe in the importance of revitalizing and respecting the commitments undertaken through and after the Oslo peace accords. We urge all sides to respond positively to current initiatives aimed at restoring dialogue and hope. The new millennium is the commemoration of the birth of Jesus Christ, when the message that was brought to us was “peace on Earth”. This is precisely the message that is central to the initiative that will be debated during this session, Bethlehem 2000. How sad it will be if the land of the nativity is still at war 2,000 years after that message. The Euro-Mediterranean process was a significant step in bringing together European and Mediterranean countries comprehensively to address issues that still beleaguer the region. The impasse in the Middle East has dealt a blow to the Euro-Mediterranean process. One hopes that this is but a temporary setback. Stability in the 4 Mediterranean must rest on multiple initiatives that nurture cooperation through gradual confidence- and security- building measures. This is the crux of our insistence on the need to establish a stability pact for the region. Initiatives such as the addition of a parliamentary dimension to this process of dialogue, promoted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the setting up of a council or forum of Mediterranean States and the eventual creation of a conference on security and cooperation in the Mediterranean deserve serious consideration. Regional approaches complement and reinforce efforts at the international level. In 1992, at the Helsinki follow-up meeting of the then Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), Malta proposed that the CSCE should declare itself a regional arrangement by the terms of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. We note with satisfaction that relations between what is now known as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the United Nations continue to be strengthened. Apart from institutional benefits reaped through regular contact between the two organizations, what is more relevant is the increased cooperation on the ground in the various parts of the OSCE area. Ever since Dipoli, the site of the first preparatory phase, Malta has contributed to the evolution of the OSCE process. It has promoted the Mediterranean dimension of this process. Mediterranean and European security remain intimately and reciprocally linked. Strengthening of security and cooperation in the Mediterranean is an important element for stability in the OSCE region. Consistent engagement by successive Malta Governments has contributed towards the greater involvement of the Mediterranean Partners for Cooperation in the work of the OSCE. We will continue to work to further this relationship. The regional approach has reinforced cooperation through the interlocking of different and distinct European and international organizations. In this respect. Malta pays homage to the role of the Council of Europe in protecting and promoting dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms and in nurturing the principles of human solidarity. We are particularly heartened by the Secretary- General?s stated intention to consolidate the partnership between regional organizations and the United Nations through a more structured, rational and cost-effective division of labour. Distinct from other organizations, the Commonwealth also continues to advance avenues of cooperation. Cross-regional projects among countries steeped in a common tradition continue to unfold. Malta upholds this international effort through its participation in various programmes that promote sustainable development. Different scenarios face this Organization. We have learnt that negotiating agreements is not enough. Universality remains a priority as we develop the tools to deal with emerging problems. Reform of this Organization is another priority. Many of its structures must better their effectiveness. Reform is not an end in itself — it is an ongoing process that necessarily requires periodic review. We must remain open to the challenge of change by being innovative and adaptive, seeking to reorient structures established in a different time, without betraying the core principles that remain ever valid. Malta has steadfastly fostered awareness of the need to revitalize the General Assembly. With its universal, democratic character, this Assembly is the ultimate expression of the principle of the sovereign equality of States. Yet, conditioned by the past, the Assembly has not fully realized its potential. As the international consensus- building forum, its role can be further strengthened, thus enhancing its authority. Progress has been registered in deliberations on Security Council reform, but consensus still evades us. The question of which categories of membership to expand dominates the discussion and attracts attention. However, other important issues, such as the transparency and openness of the Council, continue to develop. Malta attaches great importance to this aspect, which benefits the widest majority of States. Security Council decisions legally bind all Member States. Thus, procedures enhancing consultations between Council and Assembly members are of immense value. Improved methods introduced in recent years, while nurturing the symbiotic relationship that should bond Council and Assembly, prove that conferring does not hinder the Council?s ability to intervene with the required swiftness. In seeking solutions, even on what type of expansion the Security Council should undergo, the need for general agreement must be underscored. General agreement is not to be seen in quantitative terms; rather, it should be viewed as a guarantee that solutions have the political 5 support to come to fruition. Agreement on this sensitive issue must be comprehensive if it is to stand the test of time. Lack of consensus on expanding the permanent member category should not impede further progress. We support the fallback position of the Non-Aligned Movement to limit enlargement to the non-permanent category for the time being. This will allow the process to move forward without prejudice to an eventual continuation of deliberations on permanent category expansion. The environment has been the focus of uninterrupted attention since the end of the cold war. The ushering in of a new era of cooperation has enabled the international community to address different areas requiring concerted action. An unprecedented number of treaties and conventions have been negotiated. Treaty bodies and institutions now function effectively, addressing distinct but related areas of concern. In this new international milieu, the Charter?s broader notion of trusteeship assumes renewed relevance. During my presidency of this Assembly, the Trusteeship Council was about to discharge its responsibility for the last of the territories placed under its custody. Some suggested freezing or dismantling the Council. I proposed that the Trusteeship Council be given additional responsibility in coordinating international endeavours that safeguard different areas of the common heritage of humankind. Since then, many others have proclaimed themselves favourable to this type of reform. The identification of new additional responsibilities for the Trusteeship Council forms part of the reform package proposed by the Secretary- General last year. We have also taken note of the recommendations of the United Nations Task Force on Environment and Human Settlements in its report to the Secretary-General earlier this year. The positive openness to this proposal is encouraging. Malta intends to participate actively in the recommended consultations to be undertaken by the Executive Director of United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in preparing for the next regular session of the Governing Council. The application of the principles of trust and common responsibility in a number of international conventions makes their coordination the natural task of the Trusteeship Council. The principle of trust should retain its rightful place in the institutional framework of this Organization. The International Year of the Ocean is in its final quarter. Many feel that a forum is needed to consider the closely interrelated problems of ocean space as a whole. The Independent World Commission for the Oceans, on which I have the honour to serve, has vigorously addressed this vital issue. Malta suggests positive consideration of the suggestion that this Assembly institute a biennial committee of the whole to review ocean-related questions in an integrated manner. Notwithstanding our collective endeavours, peace remains daily threatened in different parts of the world. United Nations deliberations in response to such threats rightfully enjoy a high profile with the public and in the media. In most instances, the success of these deliberations rests on the sheer dedication of the United Nations officials in conflict zones and particularly on the courageous sacrifice of troops forming part of United Nations peacekeeping operations. This year, we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of United Nations peacekeeping operations. Peacekeepers have faced risks, humiliation, threat and death. This notwithstanding, they have never faltered in their duty or determination to bring hope where despair often prevails. Despite increasing risks, the United Nations has not shirked its responsibilities. Indeed, it has broadened its peacekeeping mandates. I had the opportunity to personally bring this Assembly?s message of solidarity and support to peacekeepers serving in different parts of the world. During the past five decades, the number of peacekeepers who have paid the supreme sacrifice has continued to grow. We salute and pay tribute to their memory. Like others who have addressed this Assembly before me, I have outlined some challenges facing our Organization. New problems continue to emerge, presenting us with daunting and confounding scenarios. Yet, despite all the odds against it, the United Nations has withstood the test of time. It has survived because it invested faith in humankind and dispensed hope where misery prevailed. It has gradually built the required tools to foster international cooperation. Obstacles may continue to loom large, yet at no time in human history has the potential been so great. We must seize the opportunity provided us to act in concert. Our commitment to the United Nations is unwavering. Our commitment to sparing humankind from untold suffering is strong. Together, we can head into the new millennium imbued with the founding fathers? determination to save 6 succeeding generations from the scourge of war. We owe this to ourselves. We will strive to bequeath it to our children.  My delegation congratulates the Secretary-General and his staff on their efforts to make the United Nations more responsive to the needs of Member States and of the international community, especially the developing nations. My delegation also wishes to congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. We also wish to thank Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, the former Foreign Minister of Ukraine, for his exceptional performance in the conduct of the proceedings of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly. The philosopher Thomas Aquinas admonished us thus: “It is better to light up than merely to shine; to deliver unto others contemplated truths, than simply to contemplate.” In the context of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in obedience to that admonition by Aquinas, the Grenada delegation humbly offers to this noble Assembly, for its reflection, a few contemplated truths in relation to human interaction within individual societies, as well as among nations. In his Lines Written in Early Spring, the poet William Wordsworth wrote: “I heard a thousand blended notes, While in a grove I sat reclined, In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts Bring sad thoughts to the mind. “To her fair works did nature link The human soul that through me ran; And much it grieved my heart to think What man has made of man.” In book I of The Republic, Plato made the observation that “Mankind censure injustice fearing that they may be the victims of it, and not because they shrink from committing it.” And Michael de Jouvenal, in his foreword to a twentieth century work on the history of the disintegration of ancient Greece, urges that “we study history to learn from history, to acquire political prudence”. The ideal of peace among the nations of our world has twice during the course of this century inspired the institution of a body to moderate, if not regulate, international interaction. Regrettably, with respect to both of those initiatives, the focus was on the avoidance of war and not on the concept of peace, so insightfully adumbrated by Aquinas as the tranquillity of order. The League of Nations collapsed ignominiously. It perished for lack of honour. It was unfaithful to even the rather limited principles upon which it had been founded. The weak were sacrificed on the altar of expediency, in veneration of military might. So ended the first attempt at seeking to realize international peace through the pursuit of avoiding war. Continued appeasement and non- involvement then spawned the Second World War. Yet, following the horrors of the Second World War, which prompted the setting up of the United Nations, the late Winston Churchill, in persuading the British people and, indeed, the rest of the world, to join in the second attempt to pursue peace among nations, advised that “To jaw-jaw is better than to war-war”. History records that we have not succeeded in avoiding war. 18 As we in the Assembly engage in the observation of events among nations, as well as within them, the Grenada delegation sincerely and humbly suggests that we should reflect on the question of why we have not examined relevant history to acquire the relevant political prudence? Can it be that there still exists among us a predominating subscription to the notion that might is right? Or is it that there remains an overriding precept which determines the operations of the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies: that wealth necessarily merits the enjoyment of special privileges — albeit to the significant disadvantage of the less wealthy, and especially the poor? Can it be that such a precept continues to inform perceptions as to what is truly acceptable in relation to the composition of the Security Council and the veto? History attests to the human experience across the entire spectrum, in the context of the Pax Romana as well as the rule of recent empires. When will we acquire the political prudence to order human interaction, within and among nations, so that the resulting tranquillity will ensure that peace will prevail in our world? It is with deep humility that Grenada suggests that peace among men and among nations will be realized only when human rights are truly respected and honoured universally. Indeed, Grenada submits that the several human rights which have been individually identified may all be encapsulated within a single enunciation: the right to the realization of the fullness of human dignity on the part of every person. In this regard, Grenada expresses concern about the fate of the Kuwaiti prisoners whose human rights are being violated as we speak. Prominent among the causes of erosion of human dignity are poverty and deprivation in relation to the prerequisites for the sustaining of life. In this regard, physical disablement warrants particular inclusion as a significant cause of erosion of human dignity. Accordingly, Grenada supports unequivocally the call for the eradication of poverty from our world and urges that this objective be pursued as a matter of urgency. Grenada expresses deep concern over the sanctioning by the United Nations of trade embargoes which include food and medicines. Grenada humbly urges that this kind of mandate be speedily revisited. As to maiming injury, Grenada urges that all anti-personnel landmines now in existence be destroyed, and further production banned forthwith. Moreover, Grenada now repeats another of its earlier exhortations: that the battlefields of war, past and present, should, as a United Nations sponsored project, be cleared of all weapons of war which still possess the potential for causing injury and even death, to dumb animals or to man. In narcotics there resides an extremely powerful potential for the erosion of human dignity. The voluntary use of illicit drugs by individuals does not negate this destructive potential. Indeed, such voluntary indulgence merely hastens the transformation of latent potential into virulent activity. Accordingly, Grenada urges the United Nations to be increasingly unrelenting in its campaign against narco- trafficking. Indeed, we suggest that the United Nations — with support as is appropriate in each case — sponsor national programmes whose purpose is to eradicate the use of illicit drugs by the pupils and students in our schools, and by all youths throughout our world. In this regard, we applaud the drug abuse reduction education (DARE) project and commend it for use throughout the world, modified as may be most appropriate to particular circumstances. Disasters occur in many forms. Yet whether natural in origin or the product of human device, physical disasters constitute a most significant threat to human dignity, as they do to human life. As to natural disasters, humankind is aware of that threat. Hence the awe experienced when we are confronted by such disasters. That very feeling of awe, though, may well, in its embrace, extend to an acceptance of the consequences as being inevitable — and less only in degree than the inevitability of the disaster itself. This may well explain the inadequacies of actions for disaster preparedness which are so regularly observable. We must confront this form of resignation. We must also confront the deliberate and wilful human imposition of physical disaster. Human dignity is assaulted also by economic disaster. Recent experiences in the Far East, and the current ones in other parts of our world, bear telling testimony to this. 19 Grenada contends that the United Nations and its relevant subsidiary bodies, as well as its appropriate agencies and agents, must, as a matter of conscience, revisit the concept of globalization which has informed various regimes, especially in relation to trade of all kinds, which have caused such degradation of human dignity and such pain among the peoples of the world. Trade that is not informed by concern for humanness does not promote human well-being. Indeed, it cannot. For the very ignoring of such concern is one of the hallmarks of a diabolical origin. Our world needs to be humanity-centred and humanity-friendly. Grenada urges that we regulate the many systems which together compose our global interactions. Grenada humbly invites attention to, and consideration of, the observations of an international non-governmental organization committee on human rights in trade and investment. By a letter dated 20 July 1998, the committee invited our Prime Minister and our Foreign Minister to reflect on some potential threats to our people’s enjoyment of their human rights. The potential for these threats resides in one or another of the multilateral investment agreements and the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements. Five such threats were identified, and we accept the validity of the arguments adduced in each case. Nonetheless, only three are presented here so as to stimulate curiosity, and thus further contemplation. First, the human right to self-determination embraces the right of all peoples to determine their economic future. This subsidiary right may well be frustrated, if not denied, where freedom is given to foreign investors to operate without a requirement of social responsibility to the overall community in which they do business. Secondly, pursuance of the concept of non- discrimination in trade and investment may well militate against the pursuit of governmental policy to eliminate unjust discrimination, on the one hand, and, on the other, to promote the relaxation of equality on the part of vulnerable groups. Thirdly, stipulated conditions in favour of foreign investors may very well be inimical to the right to realize the fullness of one’s human dignity. Earth, with its physical environment, is a divine gift to all the people of the world, and there devolves upon all of us a collective responsibility to protect both our planet- home and its environment. Further, we have been given authority over the locality in which we choose to live — such authority, however, not extending to destructively impinging on any other similar locality, irrespective of its size or population. Thus, every nation has the right to develop the resources of its territory, but not to the detriment of the people of any other nation. Accordingly, to engage in the transportation of nuclear waste through the terrestrial or marine environments of other countries is to engage in violating the human rights of the people of those countries. The same is true of dumping toxic waste, or food considered in the country of origin or of processing to be hazardous to health, on the markets of the less developed countries of our world. Attention has already been invited in this presentation to the ignominious collapse of the League of Nations, as well as to the cause of that calamity. Suffice it, therefore, simply to refer now to instances of membership in the Untied Nations of both components of what hitherto were single sovereign States. The people of the Republic of China on Taiwan — and they number more than 22 million — have exercised the right to participate in international organizations, including the United Nations. And in the further exercise of that right, they have chosen to contribute internationally towards the realization by the peoples of the less developed countries of the fullness of their human dignity. And the Republic of China on Taiwan has chosen to do so within the compass of certain regional and international organizations which are associated in one way or another with the United Nations system. To deny those 22 million people the right to exercise that choice is to violate their human right to choose. Further, to engage in such denial is also to enforce a restriction on the enjoyment of enhanced benefit by the peoples of States which are members of those organizations. Grenada therefore calls for the granting to the Republic of China on Taiwan of an appropriate form of membership that would allow for participation by the Republic of China on Taiwan in the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organization and the Caribbean Development Bank. Grenada does not condone terrorism. Indeed, we condemn it, whosoever the perpetrators may be. In so condemning terrorism, we are especially mindful of the 20 vicious action-reaction spiral relating to engagement in terrorist activity, whose viciousness increases with each cycle. And in this latter regard we perceive as engaging in terrorism any action that is calculated to strike terror into the minds and hearts of people anywhere. Quite early in this presentation, reference was made to Aquinas’s concept of peace. But no attention has yet been given here to the achievement of the tranquillity of order, which Aquinas defines as peace. Comment has, however, been made on aggression and violations of one kind or another. Accordingly, it is fitting that this presentation should end with a succinct elaboration of Aquinas’s concept of peace, which it must be stated, is not taken from any of the works of Aquinas. Rather, it is taken from a little booklet entitled Golden Moments, and this particular piece bears the caption “If there is”: “If there is righteousness in the heart, there will be beauty in the character. If there is beauty in the character, there will be harmony in the home. If there is harmony in the home, there will be order in the nation. When there is order in the nation, there will be peace in the world”. May God bless everyone who participates in the deliberations of this Assembly, whatever the business or occasion, so that this Assembly may truly be a blessing on our world.  Thank you very much, Sir. But I prefer to be called â€œFlight-Lieutenantâ€ and not â€œMr.â€ I join preceding speakers in congratulating the President and the other members of the Bureau on your election to direct the affairs of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. I am indeed very confident that under your wise leadership the outcome of our deliberations will constitute a great step forward in our efforts to build a new world which meets the aspirations of our peoples in the search for peace, justice and prosperity. May I also avail myself of this opportunity to express the deep appreciation of my delegation for the remarkable achievements of Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, under whose able guidance the Assembly at the preceding session took very important decisions on United Nations reform intended to prepare the Organization for the immense challenges ahead as we move into the twenty-first century. In these laudable efforts, we also recognize the bold initiatives and drive of our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, whose vision for the future of the United Nations, corresponding so much with that of the general membership and the peoples of the world, facilitated the continuing process of reform. We in Ghana and indeed in Africa are proud to have for a son a man of his stature and drive. The commemoration this year of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights affords us the opportunity to take stock of what has been achieved over the years and map out well-defined strategies to improve the quality of life of our peoples, by effectively promoting and protecting their fundamental rights, which the Declaration holds as a common standard of achievement for all people and all nations. Womenâs rights must be at the centre of that process and we should remain focused on their worldwide promotion and protection. It is their right. It is our obligation. The work of the United Nations in strengthening the equal status and the human rights of women, from the World Conference on Human Rights to the Fourth World Conference on Women, is indeed commendable. Almost fifty years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 12 million children under five years of age die every year from preventable diseases, 200 million children under five years of age are undernourished and 110 million are denied basic education. Eight hundred million people have no access to the most basic health services, and 1.3 billion human beings live in abject poverty around the world. This state of affairs persists because of the inequitable international economic system which discriminates against a developing world, particularly Africa. The persistent critical economic situation in Africa should be of great concern to the international community and should prompt us all to take effective and urgent measures to address its underlying causes. Many of our countries, particularly the poorer ones, continue to suffer from a heavy debt burden and crippling debt-servicing 4 obligations, which, by diverting resources away from development, prevent us from providing adequate social services to our populations in basic areas such as education and health and therefore reduce our capacity to compete in the global market. In this regard, we stress the need for debt-relief measures to be accompanied by concessional financial assistance, particularly to the least developed countries, with the aim of enhancing the implementation of economic reforms and creating a stable environment that enables countries to extricate themselves from the debt overhang. The international reverberations of the recent financial turmoil in Asia and elsewhere, I believe, point to the futility of any notions that any nation can play outside the rules, that any nation in this world can stand alone. In my view, the present approach of certain industrialized countries who require developing countries to adhere to standards or policies which they themselves do not observe, or seem unable to observe, will severely test relations between the developed and the developing countries in the next century. We must stand together if we are not to jeopardize the prosperity enjoyed by hundreds of millions today and the hopes of billions more for a life of dignity and a healthy measure of comfort â€” nothing more, nothing less. The new times we live in require new ideas suitable to the dynamics of today. Policy makers and opinion leaders in the developed countries bear great responsibility in this regard, as we all do, for providing very clear leadership of integrity. Much is demanded of those countries that share a great part of the blame for the present state of the world, as they no doubt have the means to be able to provide what it takes. Even though it had been clear for some time that sustainable development around the globe could not be achieved without a measure of fairness in economic relations between North and South, because of short-term considerations of profit and advantage, the countries benefiting from the unjust economic order chose to ignore the serious impact of that situation on living standards in most parts of the world as well as in limiting world economic growth. Instead, we received sermons on the truths, realities and moralities of life, and countries and peoples were victimized if they were shown not to have lived up to expectations. That was the price, in other words, that we had to pay. It was obvious, however, that whenever a situation required moral leadership from the capitals of those countries which preached morality in the first place, that morality manifested itself as no more than national interest. No one questions the need for States to look out for their national interests. However, it is the blindness to the need for enlightened self-interest that has lain at the heart of the divisions between our States for so long, and which has finally shaken the economic confidence of people, whether in the North or the South, in recent times. The end of the cold war has unleashed new threats to global and regional peace. Intra-State conflicts, rooted in ethnic, racial and religious intolerance, pose a threat to the security of many States and regions. The tardiness and selectivity of the international community in dealing with some of these conflict situations have been rather disturbing, as they have undermined the concept of collective security enshrined in our noble Charter. Article 24 of the Charter not only confers â€œprimary responsibilityâ€ for the maintenance of international peace and security on the Security Council, but also calls for â€œprompt and effective actionâ€ when a breach occurs. However, in our part of the world, we often ask ourselves where the â€œprompt and effectiveâ€ action of the Council was when Rwanda was on fire. Where was the Council when Liberia was in turmoil? Where was the â€œprompt and effective actionâ€ when the people of Sierra Leone agonized under the yoke of a brutal dictatorship? In the face of the selectivity of the Security Council in dealing with issues of international peace and security, and in spite of our regionâs meagre resources, we have had to rely on our own efforts to respond to internal strife in some of the countries in our neighbourhood. We call on the Governments of those countries to remain steadfast in making sacrifices and doing everything possible to bring about national reconciliation, peace and stability. The international situation continues to be poisoned by unilateral economic, commercial and financial sanctions, which in some cases even have extraterritorial consequences. We have seen such actions undermine the positive socio-economic gains made by Cuba over the last few decades, with the resultant deprivation of an entire populationâs human rights and dignity. The world stands to gain from a peaceful solution to the differences between the United States and Cuba, and we call on the 5 United States to settle its differences with Cuba through negotiations on the basis of equality and mutual respect. We are equally concerned by the effect of the imposition of sanctions by the Security Council against the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. However, we are extremely pleased with the recent developments concerning the possible trial of the two suspects in the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie. We call upon the United Kingdom, the United States of America and the Netherlands to engage in discussions with the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, directly or through the Secretary-General of the United Nations, to arrive at trial arrangements which will offer appropriate safety measures for the two suspects. On Western Sahara, we call on the Security Council and the Secretary-General to continue their efforts for a peaceful and just solution to the persistent outstanding differences and for a free and fair referendum. We will not have a neighbouring African country recolonized by another African country. Ghana shares the concerns and frustrations of the international community on the deadlock over the Middle East peace process. We believe that initiatives taken so far in support of the process, including the Madrid and the Oslo agreements, as well as the principle of land for peace, are an adequate basis for a just and long-lasting settlement. The international community is unanimous in its determination to see a just peace in the Middle East, and the Palestinian question no doubt holds the key. My delegationâs condemnation of all forms and manifestations of terrorism and mercenary practices is rooted no doubt in their tragic consequences on the political stability as well as the economic and social development of States. Terrorist acts, in particular, are totally unacceptable as a means of seeking redress for any grievance, achieving political ends or supporting a cause. It is in this connection that we have condemned the recent terrorist bomb attacks in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam that claimed hundreds of innocent lives, injured thousands of people and caused massive destruction to property, as well as the persistent threat to Americans around the world. I am proud to say that since joining this Organization on 8 March 1957, only two days after acceding to independence, Ghana has remained true to its commitments to contribute to the promotion of international peace and security, the principal raison dâÃªtre of this Organization. Only three years after independence, in 1960, my country, Ghana, responded to the call of the Organization and committed troops and resources to the United Nations peacekeeping operation in what was then the Belgian Congo, now the Democratic Peopleâs Republic of the Congo. We have since remained actively engaged, consistently participating in the peace efforts of the Organization, in all regions of the globe. As I speak, Ghana is listed as one of the major contributors of troops to United Nations peacekeeping efforts, with personnel serving in eight United Nations missions in Africa, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. The Government and people of Ghana are indeed proud of our participation in these international peace efforts, even though it has been at great expense to our developing country. It is not a sacrifice in material resources alone, but also in human terms, as Ghana, as well as her neighbours, has lost her sons and daughters in these operations. We welcome the adoption last year of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. My country was among the large number that signed the Convention in Ottawa last December, and it is in the process of its early ratification. We hope that conditions will, in the not-too-distant future, permit the Conventionâs universal adoption, to enable us to rid our planet of these inhumane weapons which continue to kill and maim innocent civilians long after the conflicts in which they were laid. We are sincerely of the view that the international community should pay greater attention to demining and rehabilitation, because of the havoc that the presence of mines wreaks on the economies of the affected countries as well as on the contribution of millions of peasants towards the feeding of their families. The United Nations Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court, convened in Rome in June and July this year, is a welcome development in our collective effort to provide a legal and institutional framework to hold perpetrators accountable for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and serious violations of international humanitarian law. It is our sincere hope that the spirit of compromise that led to the overwhelming endorsement of the Rome treaty will similarly be brought to bear on the work of the Preparatory Commission, to ensure the early establishment of a fully functional and effective court. 6 Once again Ghana has the unpleasant task of joining others to express concern at the financial situation that persists in the Organization, characterized by very little cash and huge arrears. The persistent critical financial situation places our Organization in jeopardy at this time of reform. It is regrettable that a number of States are neither paying their assessed contributions nor making full payment of their arrears, while some persistently aggravate the situation by attaching unreasonable as well as unacceptable conditions or benchmarks to the discharge of their Charter obligations. In this respect, let me admit that there are very small but extremely rich countries among us who could have helped without making a dent in their national wealth and resources. Support for the United Nations must be demonstrated not in pious proclamations but in the willingness of all Member States to meet Charter obligations to the Organization, including payment of our contributions to ensure that the Organization is put on a sound financial footing to tackle its mandates and pressing commitments. I wish to conclude by expressing once more my delegationâs appreciation to the Secretary-General and to the Assembly for the comprehensive reforms being undertaken to restructure, revitalize and democratize the United Nations. I congratulate most sincerely the Secretary- General and the Assembly on their achievements so far. And I assure you that my delegation, my country, will continue to work with you in this reform process and in all aspects of the Organizationâs work in order to ensure that the Organization continues in the twenty-first century to better serve the global community and generations yet to come in the maintenance and enhancement of our collective security and the promotion of international cooperation to advance the economic and social well-being of all our peoples. That happens to be the vision of the founding fathers of the United Nations. And this is our commitment.  Allow me, on behalf of the Bulgarian delegation, to congratulate Mr. Opertti on his election to the presidency of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly and to wish him every success in guiding this important session to tangible results. I would like also to express our appreciation to Mr. Udovenko for the proficiency and insight with which he presided over the fifty-second session. The Republic of Bulgaria, as an associated country, has aligned itself with the statement on behalf of the European Union, delivered by Mr. Wolfgang Schüssel, Vice-Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Austria. While the search for new approaches and responses to the processes of globalization confronts humanity with new challenges, existing cases of conflict, unrest and underdevelopment bear the mark of the divisions and confrontations of past decades. The question we have to address now is whether the next millennium will be one of continued unrest and confrontation or one of peace and prosperity for all United Nations Member States, big or small. Globalization and interdependence are bringing profound changes to the world we live in. An increasing number of issues, such as the economic and financial crisis, organized crime, terrorism and regional conflicts, cannot be effectively resolved by individual countries. Therefore, international cooperation is more necessary than ever. Today we are combining our efforts against the new global threat, terrorism. But we must not forget that terrorism appears mainly in unstable regions or weak countries, and from there spreads to the rest of the world. That is why the problems of such unstable countries can neither remain their own responsibility, nor even problems of their regions. The problems seem to be much more global. The question today is how to combat the criminal world, how to manage crisis and regional conflicts, how to feed and shelter refugees. Tomorrow the question will be how to guarantee democratic stability through long-term engagements. The other approach is only to react to the consequences, thus adding new problems. Such an approach does not solve the problem, but becomes part of it; moreover the problem is multiplied through its negative influence on neighbouring countries. We also believe that economic security is an essential part of the framework in which our efforts to make a better world are made. We are convinced that security can be guaranteed not by “hot money”, but only through real, long-term investments, which are crucial for a successful economic restructuring. 27 Bulgaria has managed to gain some knowledge and experience in handling the problems of the reform process. In the past year and a half the Government has managed to achieve: first, economic stability as a basis for moving forward with structural reform and sustainable economic growth; secondly, modernization of the public administration; and, thirdly, efficient enforcement of the rule of law in civil society. Resolute steps have been taken, in compliance with the Government programme “Bulgaria — 2001”, to translate into practice the new foreign policy priorities. At its core are the integration of Bulgaria into the European and transatlantic political, economic and defence structures, and the creation of a climate of confidence, stability and cooperation in South-Eastern Europe. We are now engaged in active diplomatic efforts aimed at promoting the principles of democracy and stability in the region of South-Eastern Europe in order to contribute to the peaceful settlement of conflicts. I would also like to stress that my country has already achieved significant progress in another important area, combating organized crime and corruption and promoting regional cooperation in this field. Let me now address the complex situation in the Balkans. I would like to note the progress made in the implementation of the Dayton Agreement. We consider that the extended presence of the Stabilization Force (SFOR) would contribute to the consolidation of peace and stability in this region. Bulgaria is particularly concerned about the continuing tension in Kosovo. The crisis has reached a point where there is no more room for general statements and palliative solutions. The conflict in Kosovo has resulted in thousands of civilian casualties. There is a serious threat of deepening the crisis and a substantial risk of spillover to other parts of South-Eastern Europe. We are convinced that the only credible instrument for solving the problem is negotiations between the parties involved, which have to examine in a responsible manner all proposals for a peaceful settlement. We support Security Council resolution 1199 (1998) adopted yesterday. It is worth pointing out that as early as last February Bulgaria proposed that the countries generating stability in the region should unite their efforts in search of a peaceful solution to this problem. The joint declarations of the Foreign Ministers of countries of South-Eastern Europe, adopted on the initiative of Bulgaria, reflect the will of these countries to make their contribution to the efforts of the Contact Group. They also illustrate the new spirit in relations between the States in the region and their responsible approach to security and stability. For the first time in many years our countries managed to put aside their differences so as to elaborate and express a common position on a problem of immediate concern. This approach sets the groundwork for the establishment of a politico-diplomatic mechanism for crisis management and prevention. In our view, those States which would like to contribute to stability and security in the region have to take into consideration the interests and positions of the countries situated there. A common understanding has been expressed that any measures aimed at settling the problems of the region, sanctions included, should take into account the political and economic stability of South- Eastern Europe. They should not infringe upon the interests of the countries involved. Therefore, we believe that efficient measures should be of a political, and not of an economic, character. 28 An issue of special relevance for Bulgaria and also, I believe, for other countries of the region, is the negative impact on the national economy of the strict implementation of the economic sanctions imposed until recently by the Security Council on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. As is well known, Bulgaria strictly abided by the Council?s decisions, suffering as a result economic losses which have almost been equal to Bulgaria?s foreign debt for three years. Given the continued relevance of that issue internationally, Bulgaria supports the view that since all provisions of the Charter are of equal importance, assistance to third States affected by sanctions has to be taken into consideration together with the imposition of sanctions. The elaboration of a concrete United Nations mechanism for this purpose is therefore of the utmost importance. It is incumbent upon the United Nations to find ways and means of alleviating the negative consequences of sanctions with regard to third States. It is our view that closer and more direct participation in the whole process by all third States which could be adversely affected by the imposition of sanctions is necessary. We are confident that discussion of this issue at the present session will yield more concrete results in accordance with the decisions already adopted and the report of the Secretary-General to be submitted under resolution 52/162. We are convinced that lasting stability in South- Eastern Europe is possible only through multilateral security cooperation coupled with effective economic, infrastructural, cultural, information and other integrated links to other parts of Europe. In this regard, the expansion of the European and transatlantic organizations to South- Eastern Europe will create a belt of security in the area and prevent possible regional crises in the future. As an integral part of Europe, Bulgaria regards our accelerated accession to the European Union and full membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as an expression of our political choice based on broad public support. These priorities are embedded in the national security concept approved by the Bulgarian parliament last April. Since Bulgaria is determined to promote and enhance the values of democracy, we are certainly interested in ensuring that these values become widely accepted throughout South-Eastern Europe. The Republic of Bulgaria welcomes its inclusion in the process of enlargement of the European Union, together with other associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe and Cyprus. The Bulgarian Government is fully aware that our accession aspirations are contingent on the success of the domestic, economic and legislative reforms. It is against this background that a national strategy for accession to the European Union, outlining the main activities of the country from a long-term perspective, was adopted last March. The Bulgarian Government has developed a clear-cut national strategy to meet the criteria for NATO membership, based on a comprehensive national programme of preparation which is being constantly updated and optimized. Bulgaria has the political will and is undertaking concrete steps to fulfil in regional terms the objectives of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council and the enhanced Partnership for Peace. Our positive attitude is reflected in the ongoing regional political dialogue and the practical follow-up measures to enhance regional security and defence cooperation in South- Eastern Europe. We consider multilateral confidence and security- building measures to be an important aspect of political cooperation in the region. An important example of this cooperation is the initiative to create a multinational peace force in South-Eastern Europe. In the course of the negotiations on this project, Bulgaria proposed hosting the joint headquarters of the force in the Bulgarian city of Plovdiv. The establishment of the force will strengthen the spirit of confidence and cooperation in the region. Another key aspect of regional cooperation is the process of good-neighbourly relations, stability, security and cooperation in South-Eastern Europe initiated at the Meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Countries of South-Eastern Europe in Sofia in 1996. Annual ministerial meetings have been held since then, as well as a number of specialized expert meetings devoted to issues of common interest in various fields, including transport, energy, transborder cooperation, combating organized crime and drug-trafficking. Closely linked to the maintenance of international peace and security is the fight against terrorism and international crime. We condemn all terrorist acts and lament the loss of life and the destruction inflicted by them. The most recent deplorable examples of such acts were the horrible bomb attacks in some African countries. We share the view that the threat of terrorism requires a decisive and joint response by the whole international community. Bulgaria supports the activities of the United Nations aimed at setting norms and standards for the fight against terrorism and international crime through 29 negotiating various legal instruments and creating the appropriate institutions for this purpose. We consider that successfully combating terrorism and organized crime in some countries cannot be achieved through the efforts of their Governments alone. It requires the effective involvement of other States, which have the means and the experience in this field. Bulgaria fully supports the recent initiative by France and Great Britain to convene a high-level conference in London this autumn aimed at depriving terrorists of their support. We note with appreciation that on 18 July this year, the Diplomatic Conference in Rome adopted the Statute of the International Criminal Court. I would like to reiterate my country?s confidence that the establishment in the foreseeable future of the International Criminal Court will be an efficient step towards deterring possible perpetrators from committing terrorist acts. The broadening of the human aspect of development through democracy and participation has been widely accepted and has become one of the priorities of United Nations activities. This year we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the fifth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. The principle of the indivisibility of universally recognized civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights continues to be a key element of today?s system for the promotion and protection of human rights and freedoms. The designation of 1998 as the International Year for Human Rights could stimulate a further restructuring of United Nations human rights activities, strengthening the staff of and securing adequate financial resources for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. In this respect we would like to commend the relevant measures taken by the High Commissioner, Mrs. Mary Robinson, and to reiterate our support for her efforts to this end. Better implementation of international standards could be achieved by improving the existing mechanisms and by open dialogue on most sensitive issues, including those related to human rights in individual States. Accordingly, the Bulgarian Government attaches great importance to the enjoyment of all human rights by Bulgarians living abroad and considers respect for their rights to be an essential element for the enhancement of bilateral relations. Bulgaria supports the ongoing process of reform pursued consistently by the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, and aimed at the streamlining and strengthening of the Organization and at making it more efficient and responsive to the new realities. One of the substantial issues of overall United Nations reform is the question of representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council. Bulgaria reiterates its willingness to support such an enlargement of the Council, which could guarantee its effectiveness and enhance its capacity to maintain international peace and security. In our view the enlargement should envisage the preservation of the balance between the permanent and non-permanent members, as well as among regional groups. As the membership of the Group of Eastern European States has doubled in the last decade, an additional non-permanent seat for this group should be secured. A decision on the enlargement of the Council and on its working methods should be supported by the broadest possible consensus, including all the Council?s permanent members. Bulgaria attaches great importance to the activities of the United Nations in the field of sustainable development and is closely following the United Nations dialogue and the activities of United Nations bodies and agencies on the issues of demography, social development, women and narcotic drugs. The special session of the General Assembly on narcotic drugs, held in June of this year, merits particular mention in this regard. That session reflected the determination of Member States to combine their efforts in the fight against drugs, and its results contributed to the common effort to achieve sustainable development. As a country with an economy in transition, Bulgaria cooperates actively with the United Nations system of specialized agencies and programmes. Our interest is to develop this cooperation further. We are looking forward to more streamlined activities thanks to the potential of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for capacity-building and assistance in the development and execution of joint projects. At the same time, the basic principles of universality and primary responsibility of Governments for the process should be preserved. In this regard the system of resident coordinators and the effort to make this more operational will play an important role. Here I would like to express our satisfaction with the performance of the UNDP office in Sofia. For Bulgaria, development and economic growth will be impossible without full participation in world economic and financial exchanges. In our opinion, the United Nations and its institutions could be more strongly involved in the solution of the specific problems of economic transition and reforms. Disarmament issues continue to have an important place in overall efforts to secure a better world for future generations. We agree with the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, that disarmament is at the centre of our mission of peace and development, and we welcome his decision to re- establish the Department for Disarmament Affairs. The Bulgarian Government attaches high priority to international efforts to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime. We call for an early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) as an important step in that direction, and support the decision of the Conference on Disarmament to establish an ad hoc committee to conduct negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty. In this context, we were deeply concerned by the nuclear tests conducted by India and by Pakistan earlier this year. Bulgaria has associated itself with statements by the presidency of the European Union calling on India and Pakistan to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and to sign the CTBT, as well as to participate in negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty with the aim of maintaining a strong global non- proliferation regime. We favour the strengthening of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction, and believe that further acceleration of the negotiations and an early conclusion of the protocol to the Convention is required. As a State party to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, Bulgaria would like to contribute to enlarging the number of accessions to the Convention in order to achieve recognition of the prohibition of chemical weapons as a universal norm of international law. As a concrete effort to this end, Bulgaria will host a regional seminar on the issue later this month. With regard to conventional arms, anti-personnel landmines are widely recognized as a pernicious weapon which indiscriminately kills and maims hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. Convinced of the need for a total prohibition of anti-personnel mines, on 29 July this year the Bulgarian Parliament ratified the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, thus contributing to its early entry into force. We are also ready to contribute to the efforts of the international community to reduce conventional weapons, including small arms, and especially their excessive and destabilizing accumulation in areas of conflict. We regard universal participation in the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms as an important step towards effective transparency, both on a regional and a global scale. In the context of the new challenges in the field of international peace and security, United Nations peacekeeping operations continue to be an essential element in the Organization?s activities. My country appreciates the efforts of the Secretary-General to ensure wide support for these and to put in place the necessary arrangements that will enable the United Nations to deploy peacekeeping forces rapidly and effectively in areas of conflict. We are convinced that the new generation of peacekeeping operations should include in their mandates a proportional combination of political, military, humanitarian, reconstruction and other relevant activities. In this regard, we believe that there are still unused opportunities to strengthen United Nations cooperation with regional organizations in the field of preventive diplomacy, crisis management and peacekeeping. In conclusion, I would like once again to declare my country?s readiness to cooperate actively with all other Member States in the successful implementation of the lofty goals of the present session of the General Assembly. We are confident that our discussions on the important agenda items before us will be translated into practical measures.At the outset, I should like, on my own personal behalf and on behalf of the Republic of Chad, to express our great pleasure and congratulations on your brilliant election, Sir, to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. The confidence placed in you to guide our work reflects the international community?s recognition of the contribution of your country, Uruguay, to the defence of the ideals of the United Nations. Your competence and experience reinforce our conviction that you will conduct our work with success. Please be assured of the support and cooperation of the delegation of the Republic of Chad in the accomplishment of your task. I cannot continue without first expressing all my delegation?s gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko of Ukraine, who, during his term of office, worked with such dedication, competence and tact on the many pressing issues calling for mankind?s attention. I also pay a well-deserved tribute to our Secretary- General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his constant efforts to strengthen the role of our Organization on the international scene, especially in the quest for international peace and security. In this context, may he rest assured of the renewed support of the Republic of Chad for the reforms that are needed to make our Organization better able to achieve its goals in the context of the rapid changes sweeping the world. The ever growing problems facing humankind — including, inter alia, civil wars, famine, epidemics and pandemics, terrorism, and the evils of globalization and mondialisation — are making our United Nations increasingly sought after to solve them. More than ever, the Organization needs the genuine cooperation of each of its Members in support of its efforts to ensure international peace and security, the sine qua non for economic and social development. The ongoing participation of the Republic of Chad in the work of this Assembly; its payment of all its arrears, despite its financial difficulties; and the presence of elements of the Chad Armed Forces in the Inter-African Mission to Monitor the Implementation of the Bangui Agreements (MISAB) and, later, in the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA) bear witness to our desire to cooperate with our Organization in the accomplishment of its noble mission. But this effort would never have been possible had we not first sought to stabilize the situation in our own country, which, until recently, was beset by a civil war fuelled by all types of outside interference. In fact, since 1 December 1990, when President Idriss Deby came to power, Chad has resolutely followed the path of national reconciliation and pluralistic democracy. The rule of law has become a tangible reality, based on the Constitution adopted by referendum on 31 March 1996, which was followed by presidential and legislative elections. In order to complete the process of democratization, the Government, together with the National Assembly, is establishing the other institutions provided for in the Constitution. In this respect, I am pleased to point to the adoption by my country?s National Assembly, in early 1998, laws on the Supreme Court and the High Court of Justice. The bill on the Constitutional Council is currently being considered. At its next session, the National Assembly will consider a bill on decentralization. In the economic sphere, I would note that the extreme poverty in my country is not irreversible, since we have excellent opportunities to emerge from it. This conviction has prompted my Government to take the course of economic and financial reform with the principal goals of restoring the macroeconomic balance, disengaging the State from public enterprise and promoting the private sector. Thus, since July 1995, the Government of Chad has adopted a medium-term strategy for economic recovery. This is aimed at laying the foundations for sustainable economic and social development. In this framework, a structural adjustment programme has been adopted in order to achieve high and sustained economic growth, reduced external imbalances and strengthened competitiveness. This programme, supported by the International Monetary Fund in the framework of a triennial agreement under its Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, covering the period 1995-1998, has also enjoyed financial assistance from the World Bank and other multilateral donors. Apart from our hopes for agriculture and animal husbandry in the fight against poverty, we rely on the important mineral and oil resources beneath Chadian soil. The exploitation of our oil is one of my Government?s priorities, because with the expected oil revenue, Chad?s income will increase substantially early in the next century, not to mention the fact that the flow of oil investments will also generate important added value for local enterprises. In this respect, we have tirelessly reaffirmed that oil income will be allocated to the fight against poverty and will help to finance health, social and educational materials; the modernization of agriculture and husbandry; and infrastructure and environment. In other words, the entire population of Chad will benefit from this oil manna. In this respect, we stress the fact that Chad is one of the rare countries of the world that is managing such a sensitive endeavour as oil exploitation in all transparency. Meetings and seminars with the various sectors of civil society and open parliamentary debates have been organized by the Government in order to explain this endeavour in all its aspects. Despite the political and economic advances in my country, we deplore the campaign of lies that is being led against my Government. Indeed, for some time now, disinformation and untruths have been spread among the international institutions and some friendly countries about both the oil question and the human rights situation in Chad. Nonetheless, my country has made considerable progress in the area of human rights. We have ratified the main international instruments relating to human rights and have suppressed all extraordinary judicial procedures, such as the court martial established in 1991. To better guarantee respect for human rights, we have established a national commission for human rights, which chooses at its own discretion the questions to be considered and governs its own activities. After more than three decades of civil war, foreign interference and ruthless dictatorships, Chad, thanks to the determination of its people, has succeeded in turning the dark pages of its history and in making the necessary institutional reforms for the establishment of a state of law and pluralist democracy, and it now legitimately expects the international community?s help in fulfilling the fundamental right of the people of Chad to economic and social development. In this respect, I solemnly invite friendly countries and international institutions, governmental and non- governmental alike, interested in Chad?s development to participate extensively in the Geneva IV round table, to be held from 20-22 October 1998, on strategic development options for Chad for 1998-2001. Our appeal for the development of our country would be incomplete if we were not to raise a serious subject of concern, the improvement of our environment, which has been endangered by the approximately 1 million mines that infest a large part of our national 2 territory and prevent all development activity. In this respect, we reiterate the appeal for international assistance made here by President Idriss Deby at the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization and reiterated by our delegation at the fifty-second session of the General Assembly. Our concerns about domestic policy in no way divert our attention from the international situation. In Africa, we are gratified at the progress made in settling conflicts through negotiation. This applies particularly to Western Africa, under the auspices of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), particularly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and, more recently, in Guinea-Bissau. The efforts undertaken in the Central African Republic first by MISAB and then by MINURCA have yielded satisfactory results. My country is proud to have been a participant in these efforts since 1996. We are duty-bound to work towards consolidating peace, which remains fragile in that fraternal neighbouring country. The legislative elections will be an important stage in the peace process, and the elections therefore call for the full support of the international community. A premature withdrawal of MINURCA, before these elections which are but one stage of the process, would endanger the costly efforts made for peace. In these troubling times throughout Central Africa, we appeal for much more patience in order to enable the international community to assist the Central African people even farther along the path of national reconciliation and security, as the United Nations does everywhere. The strengthening of existing structures for the prevention, management and settlement of conflicts in Africa must be encouraged and firmly supported by the international community, regardless of whether it is a matter for the Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa or the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa, located at Lomé, Togo. Despite the existence of these mechanisms, hotbeds of tension have emerged here and there in Africa, dangerously threatening peace and security on that continent, which more than ever needs peace and security for its economic recovery. Thus, we deplore the persistent situation of war in the countries of the Great Lakes region, and particularly the ravages of war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is urgently necessary that genuine efforts be made by the international community under the aegis of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), with the cooperation of the States of the region, so that the Democratic Republic of the Congo can exercise its right to national reconciliation, the unity of its sons and daughters, its territorial integrity and national sovereignty. This means the withdrawal of the forces of aggression that occupy the entire eastern part of that brotherly country. With respect to Angola, Chad believes that Mr. Jonas Savimbi is the only party responsible for the deterioration of the situation. We therefore make a heartfelt appeal to the international community and the Security Council to acknowledge the new direction taken by UNITA and to provide it the assistance necessary to promptly achieve the terms of the Lusaka Protocol. In the Horn of Africa, the armed conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea threatens peace in that part of the continent. The relative calm obtained, thanks to OAU mediation, must be observed in order to facilitate negotiations with a view to a peaceful settlement of the dispute between those two fraternal countries. Close to those two countries, the situation of latent war in Somalia is far from reassuring. In that country, where the different factions in conflict are sowing terror, war could break out at any time. It is important to make a concerted effort to reintegrate that country into the international community. The consequences of these hotbeds of tension afflicting the African continent can be measured in the number of homeless people and refugees moving from one country to another in search of a land that will welcome them, not to mention the very high number of innocent victims, including maimed and starving individuals. Having recently suffered the horrors of war ourselves, our country is keenly aware of the value of peace and appeals to the collective conscience to bring an end to the multiple tragedies affecting innocent African populations. The same challenges confront us in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the implementation of the Dayton Agreement must be firmly supported so that a lasting peace can be established in that part of the world. In Afghanistan, Chad urges the Taliban in power in Kabul and the opposition coalition to undertake a frank and sincere dialogue in order to achieve a lasting peace. 3 In the Middle East, the hope of peace raised by the Oslo accords is fading daily because of the stalled Israeli- Palestinian talks. We urge all the parties concerned to respect their commitments, as this is the only way to achieve a lasting peace in that part of the world. Neither violence nor extremism, much less intransigence, will enable the achievement of a just and definitive solution to this crisis which has lasted too long. My country, Chad, noted with satisfaction the end of the bipolar world and the radical change that took place in the international situation. By resuming diplomatic relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan, the Government and the people of Chad had only one consideration: to diversify relations of friendship with cooperation with all the peace- and justice-loving countries of the world on the basis of equality and solidarity. Thus Chad gave its support to the request that an examination of General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) of 25 October 1971 be inscribed on the agenda of the fifty-third session, because of the radical changes in the international situation and the coexistence of two Governments, one on each side of the Straits of Taiwan. We are gratified at the progress, however slow, that has been achieved in recent years in the fields of disarmament and the fight against narcotic drugs. However, we denounce the scandalous trade in conventional weapons which fuel so many conflicts and bring bloodshed to so many parts of the world. We are prepared to support all measures aimed at combating this scourge. Furthermore, and in the face of the globalization and universalization that is engendering the arrogant triumphalism of the powerful, the international community must rise above the disparities among its members and find adequate ways of overcoming the negative impact on a fragile international balance of the mutations that are currently taking place. In so doing, it must give priority to consensus and agreement among its members and reject unilateral actions conducted in its name but in disdain for the principles and rules that govern it. Therefore, it is urgent that peace- and justice-loving nations speak out to denounce the frequent interferences in the internal affairs of States and take a unanimous stand against the economic sanctions that are often ineffective and are unjust and fraught with social consequences, as well. For this reason, Chad once again firmly condemns the haste with which unilateral air strikes were made against a simple pharmaceutical factory in the Sudan, causing the loss of innocent lives in that fraternal neighbouring country. In this respect, Chad reiterates its support to the appeal made from this rostrum by the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to send a fact- finding mission to study the matter. As for the Lockerbie affair, while we support the resolution of the latest OAU summit, in Ouagadougou, on this question, Chad is also gratified that the United States and Great Britain have agreed that the trial of the two suspects take place in a neutral country. We appeal to those two countries and to the Netherlands to undertake negotiations with Libya, either directly or through the mediation of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in order to conclude an arrangement for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1192 (1998) and thus to establish the modalities for the trial, including measures of security and guarantees for the suspects. These negotiations are indispensable if this question is to be truly resolved. That being said, may there be no mistake as to the meaning of our policy. We wholeheartedly condemn terrorism in all its forms. The many victims of the recent terrorist actions against the United States Embassies at Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, as well as the equally tragic reactions that have ensued, force us to reaffirm strongly that no end can justify such recourse to an aggressive and blind fundamentalism. It is clear that the infinite despair in which millions of human beings are submerged cannot be alleviated by the use of force, wherever it may originate. Furthermore, the radical fundamentalism often inveighed against today is not the preserve of any specific faith. To attribute it lightly to one religion or one people inevitably reduces the scope of the actions undertaken to circumscribe it. We therefore support the plan for the urgent convening of an international conference under United Nations auspices in order to establish the modalities of an effective international cooperation for the total eradication of terrorism in all its forms. On another matter which is related to the preceding concerns, we would like to express our deep concern at the present state of international economic relations. It is indeed deplorable to see that the process of detente that is evident in the international political situation and in the globalization of the economy has in no way modified the unequal economic relations, so that the imbalances between rich and poor States are increasingly glaring. If growth has continued in the developed countries for 4 almost fifty years now, the opposite has taken place in the developing countries, where growth has stagnated, if not regressed. Thus, the eternal problems of indebtedness and deterioration in the terms of trade have been compounded by the problem of the constant marginalization of the developing countries, in particular those of our African continent, on international economic circuits. In order to achieve the objective of lasting growth and development in the interests of humankind, we invite the international community to work for a system based on rules that are just, fair and more open; for the progressive liberation and elimination of obstacles to trade, in both goods and services; for the rejection of all forms of protectionism; etc. It is therefore urgent that concrete measures be adopted to make it possible for Africa to achieve sustained growth which should lead to real development. In conclusion, we would like to reiterate our complete support for the United Nations both in the maintenance of international peace and security and in the establishment of a just and equitable international order. But if the United Nations wishes fully to play the role it has been given, it must adapt to the realities of the day. It must be credible and its legitimacy must be undeniable. The Security Council in its current form is far from enshrining these ideals, for two principal reasons: first, its composition does not at all reflect the views of the whole and especially of the least and the smallest; secondly, it pursues a policy based on a double standard, which makes its decisions increasingly vulnerable. Given this situation, the need for Security Council reform is self-evident. Such reform must respond to the expectations of Member States. This means that there must be a recomposition of the Council as well as a review of its decision-making procedures, in particular the right of veto, which is used and abused. We must reaffirm the position taken by the last Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity: the African continent must be equitably represented in that organ where the fate of all humanity is at stake. It is inconceivable and impossible to accept that an important sector of humanity continues to endure the harshness of decisions in which it did not participate.   On behalf of the delegation of the United Republic of Tanzania, and on my own behalf, allow me to extend to Mr. Didier Opertti our sincere congratulations on his unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. To his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, I should like to convey our deep appreciation for the exemplary manner in which he presided over the last session. My delegation also wishes to take this opportunity to commend the Secretary-General for the dedication he has demonstrated in guiding our Organization through one of its most challenging periods, as we seek to reform and revitalize it and to restore its focus on the economic, social and development agenda — the very heart of its mission. The reform of the United Nations is a course we have set for ourselves. Indeed, the reform we desire cannot be an end in itself; rather, it is a means to better enable our Organization to carry out its mission efficiently and more effectively. Therefore, our efforts must be directed not only at placing the development problems we face on the global agenda, but also at strengthening the concrete contribution of the United Nations in the development field and resisting any attempts at withdrawal in this area. For it is in the area of development that the challenge to the United Nations is most critical, and it is for this reason that we believe the Organization should continue to be involved, and its role be strengthened. My delegation strongly shares the general desire of Member States to strengthen the role of the Security Council, as well as to review its composition. We also share disappointment about the degree of progress we have been able to achieve so far. However, progress on this matter can only be made after we reach agreement on the fundamental principles involved and how we can move together in the direction of implementing that agreement. Tanzania, and indeed Africa, has made its position clear: that we desire an expanded, representative and democratized Security Council in which each Member is given a rightful role to play. Africa, as the largest group, demands and deserves no fewer than two permanent seats in an appropriately expanded Council. At the moment, we must place the emphasis on reaching agreement on the principle and extent of expanding the Council, and not elsewhere. An effective United Nations is a matter of as much great concern to my country as it is to all Member States. The effectiveness of our Organization depends, to a considerable extent, on its being financially stable. It is sad that the financial situation of our Organization has become increasingly precarious. Cash balances continue to be dangerously low, the timing and amount of inflows continue to be unpredictable, and the Organization is unable to meet its commitments on time. In other words, a bad financial situation has persisted and become increasingly rigid. We are all aware of the fact that this difficult financial situation has been brought about and is being exacerbated by the non-payment of outstanding assessed contributions on the part of some Member States, especially the major contributor, for reasons of political expediency. We urge them to pay on time, in full and without qualification. On 7 August this year, the American embassy in my country was the target of a terrorist bombing deliberately planned and callously executed to cause maximum damage. The attack in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, claimed the lives of 10 innocent and unsuspecting Tanzanians, injured over 70 people and caused extensive damage to property. A similar and almost simultaneous bombing of the American embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, brought about far greater loss of life and destruction of property. In the wake of the attack, many friends here sent us messages of condolence and solidarity. Some of them extended financial and material support to help us meet the requirements of treating the victims of the bombing, as well as to help with the investigations. I would like to reiterate the gratitude of the people and Government of Tanzania to all those Governments, organizations and individuals who have expressed solidarity with us or extended material support following that tragic terrorist bombing. Of particular mention here are the people and Government of the United States of America, who extended medical support and assisted in the investigations through the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Terrorism is a heinous crime against humanity. It is cruel, indiscriminate and, above all, wanton and senseless. Whatever cause may have prompted the perpetrators to resort to it, we do not believe that it is any way justifiable. It is the most rational way neither of 4 expressing one’s indignation, nor of dealing with one’s socalled enemy. Instead, from the moral and political standpoint, acts of terrorism lead to the alienation of the perpetrators, incite hatred and so, deservedly, earn them outrage and condemnation. Invariably, terrorism reduces the number of sympathizers and adds to the list of opponents. It is a worthless recourse — indeed, a misadventure which common sense demands to be abandoned now. The bombings brought home a number of realities, namely, that terrorism is a global problem and that no country is safe from its menace. It also reminded us that, just as terrorism has a global reach, so must the fight against it be concerted and global. The world must therefore make it quite clear to the perpetrators of these heinous crimes that terrorism will be answered with swift and decisive action to bring those responsible to justice and that they will find no solace or refuge anywhere. Thanks to international cooperation and partnership, the investigations into those terrorist bombings are on course and arrests have been made. In fact, two people have already appeared in court in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, charged with committing acts of terrorism and murder, thanks to cooperation between Tanzanian investigators, the FBI and several other countries and organizations. We need to strengthen that cooperation in order to bring all of those responsible to justice and ensure that terrorism is comprehensively dealt with. In this regard, we should strengthen international legal regimes against terrorism. Three months ago in June, world leaders met here in New York and addressed the world drug problem, another international criminal question which deserves global action. The objective was to commit themselves to fighting the demand for illicit drugs, the manufacture of psychotropic substances and the diversion of precursors within precise time-frames. The Political Declaration and the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction that world leaders adopted at the end of the special session were the first agreements ever aimed exclusively at examining individual and collective problems arising from drug abuse. Just like terrorism, drugs are an international menace which must be dealt with through global cooperation and partnership. On 12 December this year, we shall be celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, which was adopted by the General Assembly on 10 December 1948. The celebration of the fiftieth anniversary is a fitting occasion for all of us to look critically at our record in the protection and promotion of human rights. This is the time for us to ask ourselves whether our adherence to human rights agreements has made any difference to the way we observe human rights. This is the time for us to renew our commitment to all international instruments to which we are party by implementing the provisions of those agreements. I wish I could preface my remarks on the Great Lakes region on a more positive note than I did last year. The situation in Burundi remains precarious, notwithstanding the holding of the negotiating process within the framework of the Arusha peace talks. We continue to receive refugees from Burundi, as the security situation inside the country has not improved appreciably. Yet, we are encouraged that the parties to the conflict continue to demonstrate the disposition to a pacific settlement and persist in dialogue. In a couple of weeks, a further round of negotiations will convene in Arusha, under the facilitation of Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere, to thrash out the details of a settlement and strengthen the undertakings already entered into during the last round of talks. We will continue to urge the parties to the conflict in Burundi along the path of dialogue in the full knowledge that Tanzania and, indeed, the region can only help. The onus of delivering peace and sustaining it rests squarely and solely on the people that country. The situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is very worrisome indeed. The conflict there, in both its internal and external contexts, threatens to throw that country and the region into prolonged anarchy and war unless it is arrested now. The region, particularly within the framework of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Organization of African Unity (OAU), has expended efforts aimed at securing a ceasefire in order to initiate a political process to bring the conflict to a peaceful end. This was the spirit of the Victoria Falls and Pretoria summits, as well as of the SADC summit in Mauritius only a couple of weeks ago. We are also appreciative of the efforts deployed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan during the Non-Aligned summit in Durban, South Africa, in the search for a speedy end to the hostilities and the beginning of a process of dialogue and negotiation. My Government believes that anarchy and war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are not inevitable. They can be avoided provided all the parties demonstrate a sense of realism and a willingness to work on a comprehensive settlement based on scrupulous respect for 5 the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country; the principle of a peaceful settlement of the conflict; full respect for the rights of all the citizens of that country; and the consideration of the legitimate security concerns of the neighbouring countries. My country will therefore continue, within this framework and in the context of the mandate given to it by the SADC summit meeting which took place in Mauritius recently, to urge all the parties involved to bring an immediate end to the hostilities and to facilitate the commencement of negotiations aimed at securing an understanding on the ceasefire and its monitoring, troop withdrawals and the internal dialogue, which is so critical to the long-term security, peace, stability and unity of that country. I urge the international community to support the regional efforts now under way to avert catastrophe in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. My delegation is equally concerned about the EritreaEthiopia border conflict, which has brought these two sister republics and fraternal peoples into a war which has already claimed many lives and huge damage to property. We continue to urge the two countries to exercise restraint and consider initiatives, particularly those of the OAU, aimed at diffusing tension and finding a peaceful solution to the border conflict. These two countries, which have endured decades of conflict, know the destruction and pain which war can engender, and they owe it to themselves and to peace in Africa to ensure that nothing is done to aggravate the situation and reignite military confrontation. We also urge them to give mediation a chance. After all, it is in dialogue that both sides of the argument can be heard, and it is in dialogue that mechanisms for enduring peace can be negotiated and put in place. The instability in the Great Lakes area continues to be the source of refugees in the region. Tanzania has hosted thousands of them, and it seems we will continue to do so because of the deterioration of the political situation in some countries. The exercise to repatriate refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo began in October last year and was proceeding well. By June this year, 48,658 Congolese refugees had been repatriated. There were 47,857 remaining, but the repatriation programme was going well. However, with the outbreak of civil strife in the Congo, the exercise has stalled and new refugees are once again streaming into Tanzania. In the two months of the new conflict in that country, we have already received about 10,000 new refugees. As part of the international community and a responsible member of the United Nations, Tanzania will continue to meet its international obligation of hosting these refugees, and about 200,000 refugees more from Burundi. But we must confess that because of various circumstances, our perseverance is wearing out and our hospitality should not be considered open-ended. While appealing for increased support and assistance for our country for hosting refugees, we call upon the international community to exert great efforts to deal with the root cause of the refugee problem. Many times before in this Assembly and other forums, the international community has spoken of and committed itself to helping the refugee-producing countries address the root cause of the displacements. I regret that this has remained an unfulfilled intention. I always wonder why there has been so much talk about it and little is being achieved. Today, we see latent reluctance to engage those countries in sustained political dialogue requiring them to take responsibility for their refugee-generating policies. We see greater preparedness to rationalize their actions in the name of humanitarianism. At times the host country has been the object of undue pressure to make more concessions or even of unjustified blame and accusations. It is very frustrating indeed. This is not the way to assist refugee-producing countries to come to terms with their internal problems and spare others the unending burden of hosting refugees. We need to emphasize the closure of those factories which produce refugees, as we do meeting the needs of those innocent refugees who are the products. It is in this light that I ask the Assembly and the international community to encourage the countries of the Great Lakes to resolve the underlying political conflicts of the region and to call for mechanisms for greater burden-sharing in a way that will ease strain on the resources of the countries which have borne the brunt of hosting refugees. The peace process in Angola is, to our utmost regret, moving dangerously towards collapse. While the Lusaka Protocol may still be salvaged, we strongly condemn UNITA for its blatant violations of both the agreement and relevant Security Council resolutions. The people of Angola need and deserve the peace they have been waiting for for so long. The international community must hold UNITA and its leadership responsible for their 6 failure to fully implement their obligations under the Peace Accords, thus frustrating the successful outcome of the peace process. Tanzania will support any efforts by this Assembly which will ensure that peace obtains in Angola. The search for a peaceful settlement in Somalia has not borne fruit yet. The country remains divided into sectors, each held by a warlord. We support the efforts of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), within the terms of the Sodore agreement, as well as those of the OAU Chairman and Secretary-General, in searching for a solution in Somalia. We support the efforts to hold a consultative meeting to bring together various groups of people, including individuals, businessmen and community groups, in order to get views and proposals in addition to those of political parties. Another long-standing issue is the question of Western Sahara. We hope that the referendum will go ahead as planned on 7 December of this year. Tanzania calls on the United Nations to ensure that the preparations are well executed so that justice will prevail, especially in deciding who should vote in the referendum. We regret that the situation in the Middle East continues to be characterized by tension and continued denial to the Palestinian people of their right to full selfdetermination and to a homeland of their own, due to the refusal by Israel to honour its obligations towards the peace process. The Israeli policy of territorial expansion, in utter violation of the letter and spirit of those commitments, stands to undermine the prospects for the permanent status negotiations leading to agreement for peace in the area. We call upon the Israeli Government to abandon its obstructionist policies and to resume dialogue. In this regard, my Government is encouraged by the high-level consultations which are currently taking place between the leaders of Palestine and Israel. We hope they will lead to overcoming the present impasse in the peace process. My delegation has welcomed the recent breakthrough in the long-standing conflict between the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya on the one hand, and the United States and the United Kingdom on the other, over the Lockerbie incident, which culminated in the adoption of Security Council resolution 1192 (1998). It remains our fervent hope that agreement will be reached soon on the trial arrangements so that the sanctions imposed upon Libya can be quickly lifted. The Korean Peninsula remains an area of tension and unpredictability. We continue to believe that durable peace and eventual unification can be attained only through dialogue. We therefore urge the parties and the international community to support this course. We welcome the agreement reached between the Governments of Portugal and Indonesia to address the question of East Timor. We urge the two Governments to expand the dialogue they have initiated so that the wishes of the East Timorese people can be fulfilled. Africa is faced by a number of devastating conflicts. It accepts the primary responsibility for bringing them to an end and for elaborating mechanisms for enduring peace in the continent. It is in fulfilment of that responsibility that the OAU has taken a leading role in searching for solutions. This the organization has done in partnership with its subregional groups of countries and organizations, as was the case with Liberia, Sierra Leone and now in Burundi, Somalia, the Comoros and Lesotho, among others. My Government continues to believe in the centrality of the OAU in the search for solutions to African problems. At the same time, we also believe that where necessary, the OAU and the African continent deserve the support of the international community and of the United Nations in particular. In this regard, once again wish to pay tribute to the Security Council for the initiative it took a year ago in having a regular ministerial debate on Africa, the result of which was the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa. We applauded the Secretary-General for that report and we do so again today. We could not agree more with his observation that “it is the persistence of poverty that is impeding the full promise of peace for all of Africa’s peoples. The alleviation of poverty must be the first aim of our efforts. Only then — only when prosperity and opportunity become real — will every citizen, young or old, man or woman, have a genuine and lasting stake in a peaceful future for Africa — politically, economically and socially.” Indeed, our illustrious Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has underscored two important facts here. One, that a poor man, a hungry man, has no peace. Two, only when prosperity and opportunity become real will Africa take its rightful place in the global economy. Africans, more than anyone else, recognize that they bear the responsibility to move towards that noble objective. They need the support of the international community. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, which my country is privileged to host, has been working under challenging circumstances. During the past 12 months it has made commendable progress. Regrettably, more attention has been attracted by the difficulties it has had to confront than what it has achieved. My Government remains strongly committed to supporting the Tribunal. We are also keenly aware that, just as we have to play our part, the international community must also lend its firm support to the Tribunal to enable it to discharge its mandate and assist, as quickly as it should, in the healing process in Rwanda. The recent judgements by the Tribunal constitute a milestone towards that end. They are a landmark we should welcome and build on. The adoption in Rome of the Statute for the International Criminal Court is a welcome step towards bridging a critical gap in both international criminal law and international humanitarian and human rights law. My delegation believes that the establishment of the Court will be a concrete assurance of our profound concern about respect for and protection of the humanity we all share. It represents an important assurance that individuals, whether as leaders or otherwise, will be accountable and therefore that impunity will not go unpunished. Indeed, the establishment of the Court will be a legacy of our commitment to the pursuit of justice, and could well go down as one of the most momentous decisions of the twentieth century. It is in the context of the pursuit of justice that we must, however, mention what in our view is the most serious failure of the Rome Conference. At a time when some financial institutions are making, albeit belatedly, some form of reparation to the victims of the Nazi Holocaust, it is to be regretted that the attribution of some form of criminal responsibility to legal persons is a notion conspicuously absent from the Statute. To the extent that this was driven by considerations of corporate interest, it speaks about our lack of real commitment to justice, notwithstanding any measure of concern and grief we may pretend to extend to victims. Disarmament continues to be an important issue for my country. The Treaty of Pelindaba establishing a nuclearweapon-free zone in Africa is testament to the resolve of Africa to pursue the cause of nuclear disarmament. While it is easy to take exception to the recent events in South Asia, we are keenly aware that international responses remain the sole alternative in determining a preferable course of action. We remain convinced that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is a valuable international instrument for nuclear disarmament. In the end, the only viable alternative for international peace continues to be a commitment by all States to a total and comprehensive nuclear disarmament. The Assembly is meeting against the background of a deteriorating international economic situation brought about by the persistence of old problems and the emergence of new ones. The situation has been compounded by the challenges of adjusting to a rapidly liberalizing and globalizing world economy. The majority of humankind resides in developing countries, and Africa is the least developed of the continents. It is in this regard that my delegation is concerned that after a three-year period of positive economic growth, Africa’s economic performance slackened last year, thus demonstrating once again the fragility of the recovery process in our region. A combination of factors, including unpredictable weather conditions, lack of financial resources and poor infrastructure and technology, continue to adversely affect production performances and therefore pose a major constraint on efforts towards recovery, growth and sustainable development. Trade plays a crucial role in the economic development of any country. Despite the slowdown in production by African countries, the volume of their exports has increased over time. In 1997, for example, Africa’s volume of trade increased by 8 per cent, thereby raising the continent’s total revenue from trade by 5.9 per cent. However, it is sad to point out that despite all its efforts, Africa’s contribution to world trade remains very small and is actually decreasing. Limited access to markets, high tariffs, low commodity prices and low output deny African countries the benefits of the twin process of globalization and trade liberalization. This is unjust, because many of these countries are painfully undertaking major reforms aimed at diversifying their economies. There is therefore an urgent need to address this problem if African countries are to be assisted to increase their participation in global trade. Failure to do so would mean that Africa will continue to be marginalized and will stand to benefit little from the recent years’ economic growth and global integration. Tanzania calls for the establishment of an equitable, secure, non-discriminatory and predictable multilateral trading system that would enhance the trade development 8 possibilities of African countries, and especially of the least developed among us. The question of sustainable development of African countries also continues to be seriously affected by the heavy debt burden these countries endure. Tanzania is among such affected countries, and is currently spending almost one third of its revenue to pay its external debt, which has now reached a disproportionate rate. My country is currently implementing various debt management programmes to reduce the effects of the debt on Government operations. Despite the resource constraint, my Government has set as a top priority the repayment of its foreign debt, while continuing to negotiate with our creditors on the possibility of rescheduling and/or cancelling some of its debt. Tanzania believes that the establishment by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative is a step in the right direction in this endeavour. However, as we have had occasion to state in the past, we are concerned about the conditionalities associated with this initiative. A way out has to be found to ensure that the criteria are made more objective so that as many least developed countries as possible benefit from this otherwise important initiative. What could be a more objective criterion for eligibility under the Initiative than poverty itself? In the same manner, we support the call for the holding of an international conference on money and finance. On the eve of the new millennium, Tanzania notes with regret that poverty levels remain very high, despite the observance of the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty two years ago. This is unacceptable, and it is not sustainable in the long run. While those who have more can decide to turn a blind eye or ignore our calls to look for a solution to this human tragedy, it cannot be overemphasized that poverty is the root cause of many problems that cut across the boundaries between rich and poor. The interconnectedness of the world leaves no country insulated from the problems of others. Indeed, even if not in the same sense, the recent financial crisis in Asia and its global ramifications serves to illustrate this fact. It has been argued that foreign direct investment is more effective in bringing about development than official development assistance. This could be so, but my delegation is concerned that private capital flows are going only to a few selected countries. This leaves the majority of the poor developing countries little hope of extricating themselves from the poverty trap. Official development assistance is still an important factor in assisting developing countries in their efforts to upgrade infrastructure, which is necessary to attract direct foreign investment. It is unrealistic, therefore, to expect this enormous cost to be met by private capital or domestic savings alone. We therefore urge the developed countries to arrest the trend of diminishing official development assistance and fulfil the official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product. We would like to thank those partners that have reached the official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product. Others should emulate the example they have set. Tanzania attaches great importance to South-South cooperation as a means of attaining collective self-reliance and complementing international development cooperation. In this regard, my country will continue to work very closely with other developing countries for the realization of this goal, for we believe that this is the best way for countries of the South to integrate themselves into the global economy. My delegation urges the international donor community to extend its support to the South-South cooperation arrangements initiated by the developing countries. In particular, countries of the South wish to be assisted in developing capacities in science and technology that are suitable for local conditions. We call on the United Nations system to continue assisting countries of the South, and in particular the least developed ones, to mobilize the necessary resources to enable them to enter the twenty-first century of science and technology with confidence. Before concluding my statement, I would like to extend our condolences and sympathy to the Government and people of the many Caribbean island nations, as well as the United States, who have been and continue to be devastated by Hurricane Georges. Our hearts go out particularly to the people of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Puerto Rico, who have suffered the most devastation. In conclusion, I wish to reiterate our strong belief in and commitment to the United Nations and its aspirations and the principles of the Charter. However, we are conscious of the fact that the strength, or otherwise, of the 9 United Nations will stem from the moral and material support rendered by its Members. This is the challenge we all have to pursue ceaselessly in the interests of international peace and security and for the equitable development of humanity. I wish to express the pleasure of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas at having Mr. Opertti preside over the deliberations of this fifty- third session of the General Assembly and to convey to him our warmest congratulations on his election. He may count on the full support of the Bahamas delegation to ensure the success of this session. The Bahamas also wishes to express its appreciation to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, whose competent leadership brought the deliberations of the fifty-second session to a successful conclusion. He has our gratitude. On 10 July of this year, the Commonwealth of the Bahamas celebrated its silver jubilee anniversary as a sovereign nation. Our country is a thriving democracy and enjoys one of the highest standards of living in our hemisphere. Our economy continues its rebound from negative growth early in the decade, and increasingly we are creating the jobs necessary to provide productive employment for our young population in all sectors of the Bahamian economy. Over the past 25 years, the Bahamas has demonstrated a consistently strong and exemplary record in upholding democracy, protecting and promoting human rights, promoting the advancement of women and promoting social development and justice. As a member of the community of nations, the Bahamas has remained firm in its commitments to the United Nations and to other international organizations. Hence, the foreign policy of the Bahamas has been marked by peaceful cooperation and respect for the sovereignty of its neighbours. Nevertheless, we, like many others in the international community, are constrained to question the adequacy of delivery on commitments to improve the circumstances of developing countries. I believe it is fair to assert that the United Nations record of achievement in developing countries has been, at best, mixed. While it is true that many developing countries have gained a measure of success in their economic and social sectors as a direct result of United Nations intervention and assistance, too often such successes have been overshadowed and continue to be overshadowed by 8 serious deficiencies. Too many countries in the developing world today suffer from abject poverty, deteriorating environments, poor health standards, high unemployment rates, staggering levels of malnutrition and hunger, spiralling inflation, growing criminal activity and masses of homeless persons displaced by political and economic conditions. Such problems and challenges defy the meagre resources, both human and financial, of these nations, and many assistance programmes mounted to redress them are limited by their decreasing resources. These are some of the critical areas where the Organization can make a difference in the lives of individuals, especially in developing countries. Another area where the Organization could make a difference would be in the adoption of measures to eradicate the abhorrent practice of trafficking in women and children. We call upon the international community to make every effort to address this problem in a comprehensive manner. The Bahamas continues to be challenged by the uncontrolled entry of economic migrants to its territory, a struggle which receives scant international recognition or assistance, notwithstanding the considerable financial burden foisted upon our small developing State. Indeed, undue pressure is frequently brought to bear upon our small society to absorb such economic refugees without regard for the serious social and political consequences of such requests. It is clear that the important United Nations conventions crafted to address the problems of political refugees following the Second World War do not adequately address the problem of today?s undocumented economic migrants. We call on this Assembly, therefore, to begin to address the need for a review of the mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The Bahamas is an archipelago of some 700 islands stretched over some 80,000 square miles of ocean. We are home to one of the most important coral reef systems in the world and of important species of flora, fauna and animal life, both terrestrial and marine. Our responsibility to conserve and protect our environment for the welfare of future generations is clear. Equally clear is the fact that we require continued international assistance if we are to succeed. In this regard, I wish to acknowledge and thank the United Nations Environment Programme (UNDP) for its continuing assistance to the Bahamas as we seek to enhance our capacity to catalogue, manage and protect our rich biodiversity; and to thank also the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change for its assistance in improving our response to the challenges created by climate change and sea level rise. It is important that we begin to deal forthrightly with the obstacles which impede the United Nations from playing as effective a role as it ought, or might, in the global economy. We must be vigilant against slippage in our commitment to the goals of the Organization so eloquently embodied in our fiftieth anniversary pledge to be a people “united for a better world“ in which the human condition remained our highest priority. We must all accept that the United Nations can only be, and will only be, as successful and responsive as we the Member States allow it to be. The United Nations success is our success. The reform measures adopted last session provide a useful platform from which to refocus and improve our Organization. In this regard, the Bahamas welcomes the proposals for both a Millennium Assembly and a Millennium Forum, so as to forge a closer partnership with civil society. The Bahamas also recognizes and accepts the appropriateness of adopting sunset clauses, establishing time limits for United Nations mandates. Given the sensitivity of the matter, however, we strongly recommend that final decisions be arrived at on the basis of consensus among the Organization?s membership. The Bahamas believes that the Security Council as currently composed reflects some inequities and imbalances of this Organization. A living organization must adapt to changing circumstances if it is to remain relevant. A Security Council reflecting the eminence of post-Second World War Powers cannot be expected to adequately address concerns of our post-colonial world. As we approach a new millennium, it would be in our interest for this central organ of our Organization to be more reflective of our present reality. As a peace-loving nation, and one in which respect for human dignity has historically been upheld, the Bahamas condemns terrorism in all its forms. Such wanton acts are inhumane and wreak havoc on entire communities. It is for these reasons that the Bahamas will continue to lend its support to all legitimate national and international efforts to stem the spread of terrorism and to work towards its elimination. To this end, we will continue to cooperate with the international community to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice, as well as to address comprehensively the root causes of terrorism. We call on all Members to act similarly. 9 We wish to thank Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his untiring efforts in the promotion of international peace and security. Unfortunately, his recent reports on trouble spots around the world continue to reveal a disturbing picture. In a world shrunken by globalization, every trouble spot has the potential to affect us all. Our energies, exerted in search of real solutions to these global crises, must therefore match those expended in pursuit of responses to our national challenges. Let us seek to mark the fiftieth anniversary of United Nations peacekeeping with an enlightened breakthrough in this area. The continued production and use of land mines internationally continues to maim and kill thousands of innocent men, women and children in developing countries. The Bahamas abhors these actions. We were pleased to join the more than 100 countries which have signed the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, which we have also now ratified. We call upon all Member States that have not done so, to do the same. The Bahamas is seriously concerned by the proliferation of handguns and other weapons which continue to infiltrate small island developing States. The use of these conventional weapons by perpetrators of crime considerably raises the level of violence in our societies and threatens our social, economic and political fibre. We call on countries manufacturing handgun and other weapons to assume greater responsibility over the sale and export of such weapons, and to strengthen their international collaborative efforts to combat this problem. For our part, we have joined Member States of this hemisphere in acceding to and ratifying the Inter-American Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Materials. We commend similar action to all Member States of this body. The Bahamas, after experiencing an abatement in the illicit transit and traffic in narcotic drugs through its territory, regrets to inform the Assembly that it is again confronted with this scourge. Drug seizure quantity and frequency have increased, and the numbers of persons arrested and charged with drug offences are similarly increasing. Past experience has taught us that this is not a problem which can be resolved by any single State. International cooperation is critical if this menace is to be controlled. Notably, we welcomed the recent twentieth special session of the General Assembly on the world?s drug problem. That session adopted important decisions designed to chart the future course in the international fight to combat the supply, traffic and consumption of illicit drugs. It is now imperative that Member States commit themselves to the implementation of those decisions. The past 12 months have been a period of turmoil for the world?s economy, marked in particular by the crippling financial crisis in South-East Asia. The fallout from that crisis is now being felt, in varying degrees, globally. We have, from time to time, in this forum underscored the importance of establishing a sustainable and equitable international framework for highly integrated global markets. This need remains critical, particularly in the light of the quickening pace of the globalization of production and of capital flows, and the liberalization of trade since early in this decade. Clearly, these developments have not provided equal opportunities for all countries to share in the benefits of globalization. Countries — developing countries, least developed countries and countries with economies in transition — ought to be assisted in their efforts to become integrated into the mainstream global economy, without incurring disruptive and punitive economic, social and cultural costs. These are matters of survival for small economies like that of the Bahamas. Questions are now being raised concerning the adequacy of the international financial system to meet the growing demands of the world?s diverse economies. My Government is acutely aware that, while private capital flows have played an indispensable role in the advancement of developing economies, they should not be relied upon as the single source of financing for capital development. In this connection, the Bahamas notes the recent call for a high-level international intergovernmental forum on financing for development aimed at furthering the global partnership for development. My Government supports this call and applauds the Assembly?s efforts to explore the matter further by soliciting input from Member States. We call on this body to address the issue in as comprehensive and integrated a manner as possible. 10 My Government was also pleased to note the convening, in December last, of the expert group meeting on vulnerability indices here at the United Nations. It is my Government?s fervent hope that work will continue in this important area. As the Assembly is aware, the Bahamas has on many occasions repeated its objection to the use of per capita income as the sole, or principal, measuring tool for the economies of developing countries. This yardstick does not, and cannot, take into account the special circumstances of countries like the Bahamas, with our archipelagic make- up, our ecological fragility and our economic vulnerability. Yet these are all integral measures of our state of development. My Government looks forward to the upcoming review in 1999 of the Barbados Programme of Action, and hopes that all issues of concern to small island developing States will be addressed in line with the chapters of the Programme of Action. The vision of our United Nations to meet the needs of our people is achievable, but only if our purposes and principles are designed for the common good rather than for narrow nationalistic objectives. Otherwise, such motives will inevitably produce inadequate programmes and adversely affect relationships. The lessons of history no longer take centuries to be deduced. They present themselves starkly before us, often in our own lifetime. Will we choose to learn from them? The answer lies with each of us.  Allow me, at the outset, to congratulate you and the Government and people of Uruguay on your election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my deep appreciation and gratitude to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his successful and distinguished management of the last session. I would be remiss if I failed to pay tribute as well to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his efforts to promote the authority of this Organization and achieve its noble aims and objectives and those of its Charter. I note in particular his report on the work of the Organization, and I emphasize that he may count on the full support and cooperation of my delegation in his efforts to establish peace and security in the world. Jordan has always believed in the noble aims and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations. We have made every possible effort to maintain international peace and security, particularly in the Middle East, a volatile region whose peoples have, for over half a century, suffered from the scourge of war and from conflicts and disturbances and who have lived under difficult circumstances characterized by confrontation and polarization. Jordan, under the leadership of His Majesty King Hussein Ibn Talal, has always been an oasis of security and stability. It has always raised the voice of reason and moderation and as a result has had to shoulder heavy burdens that have exhausted its natural, financial and economic resources and placed an additional strain on its development process. Throughout the past decades, Jordan has made continuous efforts to achieve a peaceful and honourable settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. It continues to strive towards that goal by upholding the peace treaty which it reached with Israel within the framework of the Madrid Conference, and it continues to support efforts to reach an agreement on the Palestinian, Israeli and other tracks. However, the peace process remains deadlocked, despite the efforts to move it forward, including the initiative being made by the United States on the Palestinian track. As we recognize the centrality of the Palestinian track as regards the peace process, we value the positive stand taken by the Palestinian leadership and its sincere desire to reach an agreement that would end 5 the deadlock on this track and result in the full and clear acceptance of this initiative. We therefore demand that the Israeli Government declare its full acceptance of the United States initiative, carry out its commitment under the agreements and remove all obstacles to reaching an agreement on redeployment and other outstanding issues. This would make it possible to achieve real progress on this track with a view to ending the deadlock, resuming and attaining the objectives of the peace process and ensuring the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to establish their independent State on their national territory. Citing security considerations as pretexts for obstructing actual progress will further undermine the security of every party in the region. Security cannot be enhanced except through a just and honourable peace, one which is convincing to the peoples of the region and one which they can defend. The occupied city of Jerusalem has been the most important component of the Arab-Israeli conflict throughout its various stages. It is part of the Arab territories occupied in 1967. Therefore, any consideration that apply to those territories also apply to Jerusalem, in particular Security Council resolution 242 (1967). We call upon Israel to cease and void all actions that would change the status of the Holy City. Under the Oslo accords concluded between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, it was agreed that the final status of the city was to be decided in final status negotiations. Any unilateral actions taken before the conclusion of those negotiations would constitute a violation of the Oslo accords and of all resolutions of international legitimacy. Until the status of the city is finally decided, it should remain open to all adherents of the three divine, monotheistic religions. Jordan has for many years assumed responsibility for maintaining the sanctity of the city of Jerusalem and has also taken it upon itself, under the circumstances of the occupation, to take care of and preserve the Holy Places. On the other hand, Israel should desist from all unilateral actions against the Palestinian people, such as closures, sieges, arrests, the demolition of homes, the confiscation of land and the building of settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory, including Jerusalem. Israel must lift the restrictions that hinder the development of the Palestinian economy and enable the Palestinian people to start establishing normal economic relations with the outside world, free from domination and from economic control. It must also deal with the Palestinian people as its partners in the peace process, partners who are looking forward to living side by side with Israel on the basis of good neighbourliness and equality, not as a people under occupation. With regard to negotiations on the other tracks, Israel must prove its seriousness about resuming negotiations with Syria and Lebanon from the point at which they ended, ensuring its withdrawal from the Syrian Arab Golan to the borders of 4 June 1967, implementing Security Council resolution 425 (1978) by unconditionally withdrawing from southern Lebanon and reaching peace agreements with both of them, on the road towards achieving a comprehensive peace in the region. Five decades have passed since the tragedy of the Palestinian refugees began. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) continues to carry out its duties towards the Palestinian refugees — a recognition by the international community of its responsibility with regard to this tragedy. However, in recent years UNRWA has been suffering from severe financial crises, which sometimes threaten to suspend or put an end to its services and the completion of its work. We would therefore like to emphasize once again that Jordan attaches the utmost importance to the continuation of UNRWA?s work, especially given the fact that Jordan hosts the largest number of Palestinian refugees and provides services to them above and beyond the budget of UNRWA. Jordan has consistently called for UNRWA to continue its work until the refugee problem is completely resolved through the return of refugees to their land and homes and/or their compensation in accordance with General Assembly resolution 194 (III). The expiry of the five-year transitional period under the Oslo accords does not mean that UNRWA?s mission is over or that there is no longer any need for it to exist. The basic condition for the end of UNRWA?s mission is an agreement on a final solution to the refugee problem and on the full and complete implementation of that agreement. We understand the continued existence of UNRWA and its work from three perspectives: the human, the political and the legal. To ignore any of them would prejudice international responsibility for the tragedy of the refugees, who have been displaced from their homes. We therefore appeal to the donor countries to continue to make contributions to UNRWA, increasing them as much 6 as possible in proportion to the natural increase in the numbers of refugees and the need to satisfy their basic humanitarian needs. We also appeal to all financially able States to provide the necessary financial support to UNRWA. We draw your attention to the fact that were UNRWA to stop providing services to refugees, this would in itself constitute an additional obstacle to the peace process, in addition to destabilizing the region through the frustration caused by increased poverty among the refugees and the deterioration of their economic situation. It is indeed sad that while the world celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights we still talk about the deteriorating situation of the Palestinian refugees and their human basic rights. On this occasion, we are called upon to work for increased commitments to respect and to find an effective international mechanism to implement international instruments relative to human rights, away from selectivity and double standards. We are also called upon to establish a balance between these international instruments, on the one hand, and the national systems and laws in force in various countries of the world, without prejudice to the principle of State sovereignty, on the other. We therefore feel that we should recall the appeal made from this rostrum by His Royal Highness Crown Prince El- Hassan for the establishment of a new international humanitarian order. In this spirit, my country participated and supported the adoption of the Statute of the International Criminal Court in Rome earlier this year. Cooperation and coexistence among different religious and ethnic groups requires a formula for dialogue among civilizations and religions to replace the concepts of conflict and fear of foreigners which has emerged recently. Dialogue among religions will highlight the common denominators among the different beliefs of the world?s peoples and would explain their foundations to the other parties, thereby making it easier to understand and to coexist with one another. The desired inter-religious dialogue is the best way to confront the incipient manifestations of animosity and the attempts to distort the image of Islam and Muslims, whether those living in their home countries or those who have emigrated to non-Muslim countries. It is necessary to have a deeper understanding of Islam and the Muslims, away from the blind bigotry which leads to unfair generalizations about, and the stereotyping of, over one billion Muslims. From that narrow view, bigotry leads to animosity towards Islam and the Muslims on the basis of actions committed by a minority which is farthest removed from Muslims and the tolerant concepts of Islam. The question of human rights leads us to mention the continued suffering of the Iraqi people over the past eight years as a result of economic sanctions. While we call upon the Government of Iraq to fully and meticulously comply with all Security Council resolutions, to cooperate fully and constructively with the United Nations towards that end and to commit itself to repatriating Kuwaiti prisoners of war and missing persons, we call upon the international community to relieve the suffering of the Iraqi people. We also emphasize the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of both Iraq and Kuwait. Other peoples in the region, like the Libyan and Sudanese peoples, have suffered and continue to suffer from sanctions. Others who were not targeted by sanctions have also suffered from the impact of these sanctions. My country, Jordan, was the first to suffer tremendous damage to its economy as a result of the sanctions imposed on Iraq. Nevertheless, we have not only patiently persevered; we have made our best efforts to abide by Security Council resolutions out of respect for international legitimacy. Weapons of mass destruction constitute a dangerous source of tension and instability. The Middle East region has been afflicted with the existence of these weapons. Perhaps the ideal solution to dispose of weapons of mass destruction and to end the tension and instability caused by their presence is by concluding international treaties establishing zones free from nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in various regions of the world, including the Middle East. We view with utmost concern nuclear tests carried out recently in South-East Asia in the context of an arms race which, if continued, would have extremely dangerous consequences. A majority of the world?s countries have for a long time committed themselves to international guarantees that would prevent the proliferation and use of nuclear weapons. It is very unfortunate that some would depart from this moral commitment which had previously prevented them from falling into the trap of a vain nuclear arms race in that region. In this regard, we call upon all countries that have not yet done so to accede to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) in order to safeguard international peace and security and 7 contribute to the attainment of the goal of general and complete disarmament. This would enable humanity to rid itself of the terror of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. We view with particular sensitivity the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction. Israel possesses and is developing a nuclear-weapons arsenal. The possibility of a confrontation between it and other States that have such weapons or other weapons of mass destruction, such as chemical and biological weapons, makes us live under the threat of these weapons and the dangers of their use at any moment. Therefore we demand that a regional security mechanism be established and that a forum be established to discuss this matter in a way that would ensure the removal of this threat. In this context, there is a need to establish conflict-resolution and conflict-prediction centres in the region to anticipate such disputes before they occur and to prevent them from happening and escalating. The comprehensive concept of security — a concept that is in conformity with the new developments and concepts that have matured recently, particularly after the end of the cold war and the disappearance of the policy of polarization — has become a wide concept that carries within it all concerns and problems — economic, social, political and humanitarian. These problems may lead to the marginalization and frustration of large sectors of society that would in turn sow the seeds of instability and disturbances which lead to the escalation of existing disputes and the creation of new ones. It would also lead to the growth and spread of terror to a disturbing extent. Jordan has for so long called for the rooting out of the scourge of terrorism by eliminating its causes and by establishing justice and political solutions, accepted and preserved by peoples. We have also called for confronting terrorism with all the firmness needed and for the concerted and systematic international action required under the umbrella of the United Nations, guided by its Charter, to find appropriate and effective mechanisms to combat terrorism. We therefore condemn the two terrorist attacks in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. We also condemn most strongly terrorist acts of all kinds and forms wherever they originate. In this context, it is worth noting the ceaseless efforts made by the Organization of the Islamic Conference, as emphasized at its Twelfth Summit Conference, held at Tehran in December 1997, to establish a code of conduct that would unify State views on terrorism and action by these States to combat and eradicate it. The General Assembly is meeting while the world witnesses conflicts and struggles in various regions like the Balkans, Asia and Africa. In Kosovo, massacres are still being committed against innocent civilians despite the recent Security Council resolution on that question. In Afghanistan, the Congo and other places, fighting continues despite international efforts to stop the bloodshed and find solutions within the framework of the Charter and the principles of international law. Peacekeeping operations are among the most important activities undertaken by our Organization for the promotion of world peace, security and stability. Jordan has always believed in the noble goals of these activities and for several years has participated in them. The world has made important steps towards the disposal of anti-personnel landmines, which every year kill thousands of innocent people and leave thousands more with permanent disabilities, preventing them from exercising their natural right to life. In recognition of the importance of the Convention banning anti-personnel mines, Jordan has decided to accede to it. Her Majesty Queen Noor has sponsored the international effort to rid humanity of this dangerous threat, thereby embodying Jordan?s belief in the humanitarian dimensions and the noble goals of the Convention. During the past few years we have witnessed developments that have left a deep impact on the world economy, including the transition to a market economy, the removal of economic barriers and the trend towards a globalized economy. Such developments place burdens on developing countries and their economies. This requires finding the necessary means to avoid the negative impact of these developments on these countries and to help them adapt their economies to the changes and prepare them to join the World Trade Organization (WTO). Among these modalities is a commitment by wealthy countries to increase official development assistance, to find comprehensive solutions to the problem of external debt, to integrate developing countries into the world free- trade system, and to improve terms of trade. As a developing country, Jordan has suffered from economic problems, which grew worse following the Gulf war of the early 1990s. With the help of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Jordan has pursued structural adjustment policies that have resulted in tangible progress. Jordan has succeeded in reducing its budget deficit and 8 the size of its external debt. It has improved its macroeconomic indicators, reformed financial regulations in its banking sector and energized the role of the private sector. Yet we still face a difficult economic situation owing to regional conditions and to the impact on our economy of the crisis in countries of South-East Asia, with many of which we maintain close economic ties. Our exports to those countries have been adversely affected by the crisis. Improving the economic situation in our region requires the removal of barriers and restrictions that obstruct the flow of goods and services among the countries of the region, and cooperation among those countries in confronting the economic and environmental challenges before us. We are all aware that the problems and challenges we are confronting are increasing in scope and in complexity; most of them defy individual or immediate solution. We need increased cooperation to deal with them on the basis of the interdependence and interrelationship of events throughout the world. We live in one world, a world in which distances are shrinking and barriers disappearing. For international cooperation in the interest of humanity to be sustainable, we must all avoid confrontation and abide by international law. No State should be above the law. We must therefore foster democracy in the international system; that system should be free of hegemony and inequality. The United Nations should be viewed as the framework of that cooperation; this would build smaller States? confidence in justice. As we stand on the threshold of the third millennium, we hope that dialogue among peoples and civilizations will be strengthened. We hope that attitudes and actions will be defined by the fact that what we do today will affect future generations. Our concern for future generations obliges us to create conditions that are better than those of the past. We can do this only with mutual understanding and coexistence, and only with the political will to create a better world. We are confident that future generations deserve that from us, and we are confident that we can provide it.  Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Opertti on his accession to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. His election is a tribute to his friendly country and an expression of confidence in his ability to shoulder this great responsibility. I also take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for his skilful guidance of the deliberations of the previous session of the General Assembly. Furthermore, I would also like to express my country?s high appreciation to Secretary- General Kofi Annan for his initiatives, which have helped ease tensions in a number of regions, and for his efforts in making a series of serious proposals for the reform of the United Nations and to reactivate its role, thereby allowing it to perform the functions entrusted to it by the Charter. The United Nations is the only Organization which enjoys universal membership. That is why it is the sole forum qualified to deal with urgent international, political, economic and social problems. To address these questions effectively, it is essential, first and foremost, to observe the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which must govern both the work of the Organization and the conduct of its Members. Our commitment to the principles of sovereign equality, non-interference in the internal affairs of States and abstention from the threat or use of force requires us to oppose the ambitions and practices of certain countries that seek to impose their hegemony and influence and to monopolize privileges. The mandated powers of the General Assembly, in particular, should be expanded to allow it to play its rightful role, which is based on equality among all its members and on the fact that they all deliberate on an equal footing, including in their consideration of questions of international peace and security. It would be helpful in this respect to establish a mechanism to enable the Assembly to oversee the work of other organs, including the Security Council, and to hold them accountable to it. Any wealthy country in arrears that cares about the United Nations should pay those arrears immediately and unconditionally, because they are to blame for the 17 financial deterioration affecting the activities of the Organization. The reform of the United Nations will remain incomplete without reforming the Security Council to eliminate the privilege of the veto power. Historically and in terms of justice, equality and democracy, there is no longer any justification for that power. My country was the first to call for the abrogation of the veto power in the second half of this century. Moreover, it is essential to remove the current imbalance in the membership of the Security Council, not by granting certain countries permanent membership, but through an increase in the number of its members, based on the principle of full sovereign equality among States and the application of the principle of equitable geographical distribution in both categories of Council membership: permanent and non- permanent. The reform of the Council should, first and foremost, respond to the needs of the developing countries, which constitute the majority of the United Nations membership, and to the need to avoid selectivity. Despite the efforts of African countries and their Organization, conflict is on the rise and economic conditions are further deteriorating on that continent. Whatever development or increase in income they achieve goes to servicing debts that weigh heavily on them all. In his report on the situation in Africa, the Secretary-General explains that this situation is the result of the policies adopted by the colonial Powers at the 1885 Congress of Berlin to partition the continent. These policies remain the root cause of conflict in Africa. The report further indicates that Africa?s problems, including political instability in some parts and economic underdevelopment in most of the continent, were caused by those who drew the political borders of African countries. We call for the cancellation of Africa?s debts and for the continent to be dealt with on new and fair bases, not just as a source of raw materials and a market for the consumption of manufactured goods. The responsibility for all that has happened and is still taking place on the African continent falls to those who caused it in the first place. Therefore, it is high time for the States that colonized Africa, exploited its resources and enslaved its peoples to apologize to the continent and to pay full compensation for all the losses it has incurred as a result of colonialism. The imposition of restrictions on international trade and the legislation of extraterritorial laws require serious action on our part to confront and put an end to them. Member States are called upon to support and vote in favour of the relevant draft resolution to be submitted to the General Assembly at this session and not to recognize such unilateral laws, which undermine the lofty principles of the United Nations Charter, flagrantly violate the rules of international law, encroach on the sovereignty of Member States and blatantly interfere in their internal affairs. The question of Palestine is still awaiting a solution. All developments, past and present, serve only to confirm what my country has repeatedly stated: Occupation by force and the dictation and imposition of surrender can never lead to peace. No support for the occupation and the settlement policy or undermining of the balance of power will help to establish peace. The displaced Palestinians living outside their land are far more numerous than those who live on Palestinian territory. What kind of peace is it that prevents a people from returning to their territory, their homeland? The continued occupation of the Syrian Golan since 1967, the occupation of southern Lebanon, and the way in which the Security Council has been prevented from implementing its resolution 425 (1978) are further proof of the weakening of the United Nations as a result of the intervention of the major Powers. In this respect, we would ask: Why does the Security Council insist on the implementation of some and not all of its resolutions? So long as the United Nations remains paralysed by the blatant interference of the powerful, who exploit it only to serve their own interests and prevent it from acting when there is a question of deterring or repulsing aggression by their allies, this glaring injustice will continue to push the Middle East towards the abyss. The achievement of the universality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the expansion of nuclear-weapon-free zones are facing major obstacles. In the Arab East, the rulers of Tel Aviv still refuse to adhere to the NPT. They refuse to place their nuclear facilities under the control regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency. They continue to develop their nuclear capabilities with the financial and technical support of the United States, the very country that, under the pretext of saving the world from chemical weapons, threatens to attack any Arab country, including my own, merely for building a pharmaceutical plant. The recent destruction of the Sudanese pharmaceutical factory under such flimsy pretexts, later proven false, is still fresh in our minds. 18 Nobody should be deceived by the utterings of the rulers of Tel Aviv to the effect that the Arabs and their weapons are a source of danger. Neither Libya nor any other Arab State constitutes a threat to the peace of the region, let alone the whole world. These are countries that neither produce nor export weapons. Washington has destroyed the weapons that Iraq once had and has imposed embargoes on other countries to prevent Iraq from importing arms. The real danger to security in the region and the entire world comes from the Israelis, who possess hundreds of nuclear warheads. So long as nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction are not destroyed in all the countries that possess them, any lesser effort will represent a great attempt to deceive the whole world. Since the dawn of time, humanity has been afflicted by a phenomenon that has been exacerbated in modern times: national and international terrorism. The annals of history record terrorist acts, their victims and their perpetrators. If we peruse these records, much is revealed. They show that those self-styled fighters against terrorism were the first to perpetrate terrorism. By posing as fighters of terrorism, they are trying to cover the terrorist crimes they have committed and still commit against other countries and peoples. Their history is no more than a series of terrorist acts against other peoples, which have reached the stage of total annihilation of entire peoples. These self-styled fighters of terrorism have attempted to brand movements of liberation and the struggle for freedom and against occupation as terrorist. They still describe all fighters for freedom and independence as terrorists. But they fail miserably when most fighters for the freedom and independence of their countries eventually triumph. Suddenly, those who fought against these freedom fighters and backed those who enslaved them are ready to roll out the red carpet for them, organize the greatest receptions and award them the highest medals. This General Assembly embraces a number of such leaders every year and, only a few days ago, gave the fighter and leader Nelson Mandela an outstanding reception. Libya is proud to have been among the countries that supported these leaders during their struggle. Libya takes pride in their victories. Libya took that position at a time when those who now claim to fight terrorism used to describe those leaders as terrorists. Libya knows that the change in these countries? attitudes following the triumph of revolutionaries and freedom fighters neither reflects principled morality, nor aims at atoning for past mistakes. It is due to a desire to preserve their interests and to gain greater political and economic advantages. When we talk of terrorism, we should know our subject. Our talk must be objective and we need to agree on a single definition of terrorism. We should apply the same criteria and the same rules and laws. We must also implement the same measures and procedures. We cannot condemn terrorism and fight it when it hits a certain country, then turn a blind eye when it hits other countries or other peoples. The occupation of Lebanon, the surrounding of its capital and the attack on Qana were acts of terrorism. The aggression against Libya in 1986 and earlier was terrorism. The invasion of Grenada was terrorism. The kidnapping of a head of State is terrorism. Maintaining military bases on other peoples? territory is terrorism. Navies? threats and attacks against peoples and violation of their territorial waters — this is terrorism. Attempts on the lives of national leaders are terrorism. The downing of a Libyan civilian airplane over Sinai was terrorism. The downing of the Iranian airplane in the Gulf was terrorism. Forcing the Security Council to react to a missile that fell in the sea and preventing it from reacting to missiles that were intentionally launched against a pharmaceutical plant in a peaceful city, Khartoum, and from sending a mere fact-finding mission — this is terrorism. In this respect, we forcefully support Sudanese demands for investigation and compensation and condemn this terrorist aggression. Are we supposed to condemn terrorism only when it touches a certain country or countries? Should we turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to what is being committed by that country or those countries against humanity as a whole? This, too, is terrorism. Terrorism will be eradicated only when its causes, not just its results, are addressed; not by committing similar terrorist acts. We cannot fight terrorism with terrorism. As one Arab poet says: “Practise what you preach. Great shame on you if you do not.” We in Libya condemn terrorist acts, their perpetrators, their sponsors and those who finance them. We are ready to cooperate with all countries that truly want to put an end to terrorism. Libya, in a letter to the Secretary-General dated 9 January 1992 (document A/46/840), was the first to call on the United Nations to convene a special session of the General Assembly to be devoted to international terrorism. In this respect, we wish to note that some people insist, in and out of context, on linking Islam and Muslims to terrorism. This in itself is another kind of 19 terrorism. The very name of Islam is derived from the word salaam, which means “peace”. A person is considered a Muslim when others are safe from his words and his deeds. The greeting of Muslims, when coming or going, is assalamu alaikum, meaning “peace be upon you”, and the answer is “and the same to you”. It seems believable that, as has been demonstrated in some works and studies, certain people can determine their own identity only by identifying their enemy. Now that the ideological enemy, embodied for several decades in the communist ideology, has disappeared, they have chosen Islam as their new alternative adversary. Upon the disappearance of the international opponent, the former Soviet Union, they chose the Muslims to be the new enemy. At this juncture, let us ask the following questions, though we know in advance that they will go unanswered. First, who recruited, transported, financed, trained and armed those who fought in Afghanistan during the presence of Soviet troops there? Secondly, who called these people mujahidin when they fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan? And who now calls them terrorists? How and why did yesterday?s mujahid become today?s terrorist? Thirdly, where do the leaders of the organizations which plan and supervise the implementation of terrorist actions in their homelands live? Sisterly Algeria is not the only example. Fourthly, who protects these people? Who finances them? Who arms them? Who trains them? Where? And Why? These and other, similar questions will not be publicly acknowledged by the parties concerned, but that does not mean that there is no answer. Islam is the victim. Muslims are the targets and victims of terrorism, alongside the rest of third world peoples. God Almighty addresses his Prophet and Messenger in the Koran by saying: “We sent thee not, but as a mercy for all creatures.” (The Holy Koran, XXI:107) Verily spoke God. The Prophet of mercy preached the religion of mercy, not terrorism. My country has always sought to make the Mediterranean a region of security, cooperation and peace. It is a source of satisfaction that in July this year we issued a joint statement with Italy which eliminated many aspects of the legacy of the past and laid down a solid basis for cooperation to serve the interests of both countries and peoples and contribute to the strengthening of peace and stability in that strategic part of the world. We believe that this is a model that should be emulated in other arrangements, including European and Mediterranean partnerships. Among the issues on which the peoples of the Mediterranean should cooperate and act in solidarity is the foreign military presence in the region. We in Libya would again like to express our concern about this presence. We again call on foreign States to dismantle their military bases around the Mediterranean and withdraw their fleets from its waters. Their presence poses a danger to the peoples of the region. The world is still witnessing a continuation of old disputes and conflicts such as those in Cyprus, Afghanistan, Angola and Somalia. These conflicts have persisted for too long, despite all the efforts made to resolve them peacefully. The international community should increase its efforts to settle these disputes and end the suffering of their peoples. The people of Iraq are suffering from international sanctions which are unprecedented in their severity and cruelty. These sanctions have resulted in human tragedies which could never be accepted by principled human beings. Other countries have exploited these sanctions in order to achieve their own selfish political purpose of destroying Iraq, violating its territorial integrity and breaking up its unity. This will have disastrous consequences sooner or later. Furthermore, it is a violation of the Charter, the principles of international law and all international norms. In the Horn of Africa the situation in Somalia is still a source of great concern. My country has consistently made efforts to assist the competing Somali factions solve their differences. We will continue those efforts with a view to reaching a solution to ensure Somali national reconciliation that is satisfactory to all Somalis. The Jamahiriya, which has the honour of presiding over the group of Sahel and desert countries, has submitted a serious initiative for the settlement of the dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea. This initiative, which enjoys full recognition, remains the best framework for the solution of the border dispute between the two countries and the normalization of relations between their two peoples. I should now like to provide an account of the latest developments in the dispute between my country and the United States and the United Kingdom over the Lockerbie question. In this regard, I shall deal with the latest, not the oldest, of these developments. On 21 July the media announced that the United States and the United Kingdom 20 were considering the possibility of accepting the two suspects for trial in a third country, which may be the Netherlands. Libya contacted the President of the Security Council and most of its members, as well as the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to welcome this development in the event that it became an official position. To prove and confirm its seriousness, Libya suggested to them that the Secretary- General should look into the matter once it became an official position and contact all the parties to seek to reach a practical and serious formula that would respond to the interests of all the parties and could gain their approval. Our intention was that if such a formula were submitted to the Security Council, its approval would be assured and its implementation would thereby be a foregone conclusion. At the time, Libya expressed a number of fears and concerns to which it drew attention and warned against the Security Council approving any formula that did not address such fears and concerns in its enthusiasm of feeling that there was a positive development on the issue. At that time — the last week of July — we drew attention to the fact that Libya was concerned that the other party might have taken its approach for certain short-term reasons: first, to circumvent the two Judgments of the International Court of Justice; secondly, to pre-empt the decision taken at the Ouagadougou summit; thirdly, to forestall a potential resolution at the Durban summit; fourthly, to continue the sanctions imposed on Libya; fifthly, to distance between the international community and support for Libya by misleading it into believing that the other party had already accepted the proposals of regional and international organizations; and sixthly, to take the whole question back to its starting point. At that time, before the official position of the two countries was made public and as a test of the seriousness of the other party, Libya stressed the need for certain considerations. First, we requested a guarantee that the two suspects would not be handed over or moved to either the United States or the United Kingdom. Secondly, we asked for a guarantee of their legal, religious, social, personal and health rights throughout the various phases of the trial. Thirdly, we requested that the Libyan judicial authorities and the defence of the two suspects should handle all technical, legal questions relevant to the legal aspect of the trial. We were now talking about a legal and not a political matter. The legal and judicial authorities of the countries concerned had done so with regard to their side of the question. Our intuition proved right and our suspicions were confirmed. On Monday, 24 August 1998, the United States and the United Kingdom addressed a joint letter to the Secretary-General to which they attached the text of a draft agreement between the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of the United Kingdom, together with the text of a bill which the United Kingdom intended to enact as law to enable the Scottish Court to conduct the trial in the Netherlands. On Tuesday, 25 August, the two countries submitted a draft resolution to the Security Council. On Wednesday, 26 August, the draft resolution was formally submitted to the Council. On Thursday, 27 August, as we expected, the Security Council approved the draft resolution, motivated by a feeling that it was a positive development, without pausing to discover the poison that was slipped surreptitiously into the honey. The letter sent to the Secretary-General, together with its detailed and complicated legal attachments, was approved without giving even the members of the Security Council a chance to study them. Libya then requested the Council to postpone acting on the resolution because it and its attachments required consideration by the competent Libyan judicial authorities. These documents had not at that time reached Libya and had not even been translated into Arabic. The adversary and the arbiter in the Council prevented the Council from responding to Libya?s request. During the review session last March, the same adversary and the same arbiter prevented the Council from studying the Judgments of the International Court of Justice, officially referred to it by Libya, under the pretext that these Judgments needed to be studied by legal experts in their two countries. This stark contradiction in positions and criteria we leave to the judgement of the Assembly, and we have no doubt that it will reach the right conclusions. Security Council resolution 1192 (1998), adopted on 27 August 1998, suggests that the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has not implemented the requirements of Council resolutions, as in paragraph 1 it “Demands once again that the Libyan Government immediately comply with the above- mentioned resolutions.” This refers to resolutions 731 (1992), 748 (1992), 883 (1993). It also suggests that Libya has done nothing in 21 that connection, whereas Libya has responded fully to all of these resolutions. Paragraph 4 of resolution 1192 (1998) states that “the Libyan Government shall ensure that any evidence or witnesses in Libya are, upon the request of the court, promptly made available at the court in the Netherlands for the purpose of the trial”. To ask Libya to provide evidence and witnesses contradicts logic and law. It is not Libya that has accused the two suspects. It is the United States and the United Kingdom that claim to possess evidence which justifies their suspicions. They alone have the responsibility to provide the evidence and the witnesses for the prosecution in order to prove their case. This demand in itself proves that those two countries have no evidence to support the accusation of our two citizens. On what, then, is this suspicion based? It is a suspicion still in search of evidence and witnesses. The best quotation we can cite in this respect is the statement made by the freedom fighter and leader, President Nelson Mandela, last week in Washington: “I know of no system of jurisprudence anywhere in the world where the accused is required to produce witnesses for the prosecution.” On the whole, in the text to which I have been referring, Libya sees interference in the work and procedures of the court, a limitation on the rights of the accused to defend themselves, and an abrogation of Libya?s legal rights guaranteed under international law and custom governing procedures and the provision of proof. Security Council resolution 1192 (1998) referred to the joint letter dated 24 August 1998 from the Governments of the United Kingdom and of the United States, contained in document S/1998/795, to which is annexed the text of the intended agreement between the Governments of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and of the United Kingdom. In its article 16 (2), that agreement refers to the “transfer [of] the accused from the premises of the Scottish Court [in the Netherlands] to the territory of the United Kingdom ..., “(a) ... for the purpose of trial by jury in Scotland”. (S/1998/795, annex II) However, the initiative adopted by the Security Council, which in essence is a political initiative, is based on what was adopted by the regional and international organizations whose letters were cited in the preambular part of Security Council resolution 1192 (1998). Here we would like to refer in particular to the content of the joint letter from the Secretaries-General of the League of Arab States and of the Organization of African Unity, annexed to document S/1997/497. Any text that would make it possible to transfer the two suspects to any place other than the Netherlands, under any circumstances, runs counter to the regional initiatives accepted by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. That is only some of the poison in the honey: the world has heard that the United Kingdom and the United States have agreed to have a trial in the Netherlands. Now they talk about Scotland, the United Kingdom and the United States. We shall clarify this presently. The letter then states, in paragraph 4, that, “If found guilty, the two accused will serve their sentence in the United Kingdom”. Moreover, the intended agreement states in article 16 (2) (b) that the accused would be transferred to the United Kingdom “for the purpose of serving a custodial sentence imposed by the Scottish Court following the conviction of the accused”. That contradicts the initiative; I cannot believe that anyone understood the initiative to mean anything other than that the trial would take place in a third country. This provision runs counter to the general understanding of the initiative, that the purpose of the trial of the two suspects is to reveal the truth in the tragic incident of Pan Am flight 103, and not to exact revenge on two Libyan citizens who are merely suspected, without evidence. It is the understanding also that the ultimate venue of all the trial procedures would be in a third country: in the Netherlands, and not anywhere else. The agreement by the various parties to the holding of the trial in the Netherlands is a political solution that came about as a result of political action. The place where the sentence should be served, if, God forbid, they are convicted, should be the same place as the trial. This is part of the political solution. They claim that Scottish law stipulates that sentences should be served in Scotland, because Scottish courts sit in Scotland. But this court will sit outside Scotland, so any sentence should also be carried out outside Scotland. The court is, exceptionally, sitting in another country, so the sentence must be served in the country where the trial takes place, not in Scotland. Paragraph 8 of Security Council resolution 1192 (1998) reads in part that the Council 22 “decides that the aforementioned measures shall be suspended immediately if the Secretary-General reports to the Council that the two accused have arrived in the Netherlands for the purpose of trial before the court described in paragraph 2 or” — and here pay attention to this new poison in the honey — “have appeared for trial before an appropriate court in the United Kingdom or the United States”. In a dispute that has lasted for more than seven years, this is the first time that the Security Council has adopted a resolution asserting that the trial can take place before a court in the United Kingdom or the United States. I have addressed a letter to the Secretary-General indicating that the proposal of the League of Arab States and the Organization of African Unity regarding a trial under Scottish law, before a Scottish court, at the International Court of Justice in The Hague defines an “appropriate court”. But the resolution says (spoke in English) “an appropriate court in the United Kingdom or the United States”, not an appropriate British or United States court. (spoke in Arabic) For the first time, the resolution refers to such a venue. There is no need for the addition of a reference to an “appropriate court in the United Kingdom or the United States” — unless the purpose is to transfer the two suspects to the Netherlands as a transit station before transferring them to one of the two countries mentioned in that paragraph. If that is the case, it can be qualified only as institutional piracy condoned by Security Council resolution. The world is unaware of this situation. I know that members are busy with their own concerns, but I remind them that I am citing the text of the new Security Council resolution. Along with the rest of the international community, we have agreed to a trial before a Scottish court sitting in a third country, which could be the Netherlands. We have agreed to a Scottish court, to Scottish law and to Scottish judges, in the Netherlands. Those are the terms described in the decisions of the regional organizations. But what does that paragraph mean? But Libya never subscribed to these new terms, and the regional organizations never agreed that a trial should take place in the United States or in the United Kingdom. To suggest that this is the “appropriate court” referred to in paragraph 16 of resolution 883 (1993) is to attempt to deceive the international community, and is yet another example of the poison in the honey. The Council was misled into accepting this because of the existence of a feeling that there was a change in the position of the two countries. Another meaningless reference came in paragraph 8 on the relations between the Libyan Government and the French judicial authorities, relevant to the explosion of Union de Transports Aériens flight 772. This question has nothing to do with the subject of the initiative upon which resolution 1192 (1998) is based. Moreover, it is well established in the Security Council that Libya has done all that has been required of it by the French judge in this respect and that the French authorities have expressed their total satisfaction, and this was endorsed by the Security Council. Libya believes that the optimal, pragmatic and prompt solution lies in conducting negotiations among all parties with a view to reaching an agreement on the practical procedures for the application of the option of trying the two suspects before a Scottish court in a neutral country — the Netherlands — as called for by the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement held in South Africa at the beginning of September 1998. Should direct negotiations prove impossible due to the opposition of the United States and the United Kingdom, these negotiations can be conducted through the Secretary-General. The proposed agreement should determine all practical measures, the commitments of each party and the rights and guarantees to be accorded the two suspects and their defence team. It should also precisely state what all the parties are required to do so that the trial of the two suspects will be the final phase of the implementation of Security Council resolutions, not the first phase. This should lead to the lifting of the sanctions imposed on Libya and put an end to any attempts to change positions or otherwise circumvent the situation under the pretext that Libya has not fully complied with Security Council resolutions — because Libya has fully done what it has been required to do. Even the exchange of goods is governed by agreements and contracts that regulate and explain the responsibilities of various parties, suppliers and exporters. Goods are insured and reinsured against all risks. These are people, human beings we are talking about here. They are not going to the Netherlands for tourism; we?re not going to bid them farewell, have a nice trip. Having said 23 that, we wonder what is meant by electing to hold the trial in a military base used by the Americans in the Netherlands? Is the base that the Americans use as members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization the only place in the Netherlands where the trial can take place? What is this? Following are some of the questions that the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya deems it necessary to resolve and reach an agreement on. First, there is a need to agree on listing, clarifying and determining, in advance, the witnesses needed — not only from Libya, but from all parties. The defence team should have the right to receive and peruse all evidence and cross-examine all witnesses. Secondly, there needs to be agreement on the place where the suspects would spend the time of their sentence in case of conviction, either in the Netherlands or in Libya. Thirdly, we need guarantees that the two suspects will not be extradited or transferred to either the United States or the United Kingdom for any reason whatsoever at any phase of the trial. Fourthly, there needs to be an agreement on the security, legal, personal, social, health and religious rights of the two suspects during the various phases of the trial. We need to conclude an agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya specifying how the two suspects will be transferred to the Netherlands and guaranteeing their security and safety, during their transfer, stay and their return at the end of the trial. Such an agreement should be endorsed by the Security Council and implemented under the supervision of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. In conclusion, I would like to reaffirm that the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has accepted a trial of the two suspects before a Scottish court in accordance with Scottish law, presided over by Scottish judges, that would sit in the Netherlands, but we will not accept the setting of any conditions in relation to the implementation of that proposal. Libya is ready to take this exceptional road in order to reach a solution to the dispute that would satisfy the interests of all parties and in order to settle the outstanding legal issues through direct negotiations or through the Secretary-General. Libya has not interfered in the agreements concluded by the other parties for the purposes of the trial. Also, it has not authorized anyone to decide on her behalf matters relating to her citizens, because this is its constitutional right and duty. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands can conclude an agreement; this has to do with the Netherlands court and because the Netherlands is the seat of the court, but as far as the Libyan citizens are concerned, we never authorized anyone to conclude any agreements on our behalf. We are responsible for our citizens, the suspects included. They have a team of lawyers to defend them. We do not interfere in other States? affairs, nor do we want anyone to interfere with our affairs either. We would like to confirm our seriousness, our desire and our willingness to close the file of this case and other files as well, and open a new chapter in our relations with the countries concerned based on mutual respect and non- interference in internal affairs. It is with the greatest pleasure that I congratulate my colleague from Uruguay, Didier Opertti, on his election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. In his election I see the recognition of the role played internationally by the Republic of Uruguay, an Ibero-American country and a friend of Portugal, as well as our appreciation and our confidence that his personal, intellectual and professional qualities will result in success in our work. I would also like to pay tribute to the outgoing President, Hennadiy Y. Udovenko, for the dedicated and competent manner in which he steered the work of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session. To the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, I renew my tribute for the remarkable manner in which he has been carrying out his difficult functions during a period in which the United Nations is increasingly called upon to intervene in many aspects of international life. I would like to dwell upon some questions of particular importance to my country, beginning with those of a political nature, including Africa. I recall that my Austrian colleague has already addressed the Assembly on behalf of the 15 States members of the European Union. When releasing last April his excellent report on the causes of conflict and the promotion of lasting peace and sustainable development in Africa, the Secretary-General did not hesitate to qualify as “colossal” (S/1998/318, para. 5) the scale of the human tragedy that persists in parts of the African continent, which has been devastated by the conflicts that have affected a number of States since the end of the cold war. Within its possibilities and in accordance with the historical, cultural and social ties that bind it to many regions and countries of Africa, Portugal continues to make efforts towards helping overcome those conflicts by peaceful means and towards the promotion of economic development, social progress and good governance, which are indispensable for their eradication. I would like to underline the readiness Portugal has shown to participate in United Nations peacekeeping missions, particularly in Africa. By way of example, I recall the role played by Portuguese forces within the framework of the peace 15 process in Mozambique, and in the ongoing United Nations missions in Angola, in Western Sahara and, most recently, in the Central African Republic, as well as in the evacuation operations undertaken in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Guinea-Bissau. I must express here the very serious concern of my country at the situation in Angola, a country to which we are bound by so many and such deep ties. The signs of rupture are becoming more dangerously evident in the peace process, which has proceeded with such difficulty. The refusal by the União Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola (UNITA) to comply fully with the obligations of the Lusaka Protocol, which it freely signed, with regard to its demilitarization and transformation into a political party, and its obstruction of the normalization of State administration contribute to the resort to military options outside the framework of the negotiated solutions adopted by the international community. As a member of the troika of observer countries to the Angolan peace process and as one of countries that contributed most to the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM) and to the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA), Portugal remains committed to promoting concord in Angola in close cooperation with the United Nations and, in particular, with the new Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Issa Diallo, whose difficult mission should be helped and supported. We are, however, fully aware of the fact that all the diplomatic efforts will be in vain if those responsible in Angola do not have an effective will for peace. The Government and UNITA must assume their responsibilities to the Angolan people, whose right to peace, security and well-being is legitimate and inalienable. We appeal, once again, for the Lusaka Protocol to be respected, and in particular appeal to UNITA to assure immediately the Protocol?s implementation, in strict accordance with the terms that have been demanded of it by the Security Council. The gains of a multi-party system in Angola must not be jeopardized. Its participants, particularly having endorsed peace and national reconciliation, must not see the erection of barriers to the respective mandates, and all must be given the conditions of security necessary to face the reconstruction of the country. The Secretary-General deserves our full support in continuing to promote all the necessary responses that the gravity of the situation requires from the international community. Guinea-Bissau — a friend of Portugal with which we also share many varied and strong affinities — has since June been the site of a conflict that has had grave human, economic and social consequences for its people. At the express request of the parties to the conflict, Portugal and the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP) — which is principally made up of African countries, and has among its main goals the political and diplomatic coordination of its members? policies — carried out from the start mediation efforts designed to stop the fighting, obtain a negotiated solution to the conflict and bring humanitarian assistance to the population of Guinea-Bissau. At no time was it possible to doubt the legitimate intentions that led the CPLP, of which Guinea-Bissau is a founding member, to respond to the request made to it. The CPLP?s intervention aligned itself with that of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), eventually permitting the signature of a ceasefire agreement between the Government and the military junta, which opened the way to a negotiated settlement of the conflict. Still on the African continent, a word is also due on the events in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We defend unequivocally the need to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of that vast country, whose stability is strategically essential to the region in which it is located. We support unconditionally the African peace initiatives that seek a negotiated and peaceful solution to the complex political problems of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which are at the heart of the conflict and cannot and should not have a solution based on the use of force or on the presence of foreign military forces. Notwithstanding continued difficulties, we still believe in a democratic, free and prosperous future for Africa. We are therefore committed to bringing to fruition the initiative we launched in 1996 to hold a summit between the European Union and Africa, which is now scheduled for 2000. We therefore welcomed with satisfaction the decision taken by the most recent Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit in Ouagadougou to endorse that initiative. I would now like to refer to another source of serious and justified concern for the international community, this time on the European continent: the crisis in Kosovo, which jeopardizes peace and stability in the 16 Balkans and is producing heavy human losses, in terms of deaths, injuries, internally displaced persons and refugees. There can be no doubt as to who bears the primary responsibility for the eruption of the current crisis. The adoption a few minutes ago by the Security Council of a resolution co-sponsored by Portugal is a clear signal of the determination of the international community and cannot be ignored by those to whom it is addressed. Portugal welcomes the constructive spirit that dominated the most recent round of ministerial talks on the question of East Timor, held under the auspices of the Secretary-General, whose efforts at mediation, as well as those of his Special Representative, Ambassador Marker and his collaborators, I would especially like to congratulate. I believe I can, for the first time, say that effective and promising steps have been taken towards creating the conditions to achieve a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to this problem, with full respect for the legitimate rights of the East Timorese people, in accordance with the principles of the Charter and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. While safeguarding the basic positions of principle of the parties, it was agreed to negotiate for East Timor a wide-ranging autonomy that we wish to see rest on genuinely democratic and participatory rules for its people, who, it is hoped, will progressively establish an ample degree of self-government. It was also agreed to associate more closely the East Timorese — whose will, freely expressed in accordance with their legitimate right to self- determination, will be essential to validate any definitive solution to the question — with the process of negotiations under way, entrusting the Secretary-General with the responsibility of promoting that wide consultation. It is necessary now to achieve tangible progress with regard to the more critical aspects of the situation in the territory, such as the reduction of the Indonesian military presence, the release of all East Timorese political prisoners, including Xanana Gusmao, and the monitoring by the United Nations of the evolution of the situation on the ground. We believe that we are still at a turning point. Nothing substantial has yet been settled or guaranteed. That is why we consider it essential that the international community continue to follow closely the evolution of this process in its varied aspects, so that the goal of finally enabling the people of East Timor to enjoy a future of freedom, peace and security is not delayed any further. In just over a year, on 20 December 1999, the territory of Macao, currently under Portuguese administration, will return to the sovereignty of the People?s Republic of China, in fulfilment of the terms of the Luso-Chinese Joint Declaration of 13 April 1987. The transition process has been carried out in a constructive and pragmatic climate, reflecting the good relations that exist between the two countries. We are convinced that this climate will persist until the end, thus guaranteeing a transfer of power conducive to the future stability and prosperity of Macao, while respecting its autonomy and uniqueness. As a short note on the question of official development assistance, I would like to put on record that, according to data on 1997 recently issued by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Portugal was the donor that registered the largest increase in this type of aid — 27.3 per cent. Within the framework of the International Year of the Oceans, Portugal dedicated the last World Exposition of this century — EXPO ?98 — to the theme “The oceans: a heritage for the future”, attempting in this manner to contribute to a progressive enlightenment of humanity with regard to the risks and challenges related to the preservation of the oceans. Still in this area, Portugal has participated actively in various activities undertaken in the context of the United Nations, namely at the level of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Independent World Commission on the Oceans. In fact, Portugal was granted the honour of the presidency of the latter, in the person of Dr. Mario Soares, and its work led to the adoption of the report approved in Lisbon at the beginning of this month, which appeals for a democratic, equitable and peaceful management of the “ocean ... our future”, and which will be submitted to the General Assembly. Portugal is a non-permanent member of the Security Council until the end of this year. We have sought to contribute effectively to the strengthening of the Council?s authority and the effectiveness of its action, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter. On the other hand, increasing the transparency and democratic nature of its functioning is essential to us, allowing, in this way, non-members to better follow the work of the Council. 17 This year, as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, none can purport to defend international law and legitimacy while ignoring the fulfilment of those fundamental rights. Terrorism is one of the most perverse forms of human rights violation, and a coordinated international effort to combat it is urgently required. I should like to mention that Portugal is a candidate for membership in the Commission on Human Rights, for a mandate that will begin in January 2000 and that will coincide with the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union. In an era of globalization — of markets, information, circulation of people and cultural exchange — we also have a duty to include in the international agenda the globalization of human rights. This will be the best tribute we can pay to the Universal Declaration that was issued 50 years ago. Through you, Sir, I would like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly on his election, which was so richly deserved because of his vast experience in international affairs and his well-known personal qualities. Uruguay, a friend to Peru, represents the authentic aspiration to peace and respect for international law that are standards of conduct for Latin America and for Peru. I hereby reaffirm my countryâs unwavering adherence to the purposes, principles and standards enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which provide a guarantee of harmonious relations among States and of the full applicability of international law, as well as a foundation for the worldwide promotion of human rights, economic and social development and cooperation for development â€” all touchstones of international peace and security. Only 10 years ago, the community of nations was moved by the dream of building a peaceful, democratic, equitable and multilateral new world order. Today, while we appreciate the continuing extension throughout the world of those positive tendencies, we note as well an accumulation of negative developments that threaten to initiate a period of uncertainty and change posing unprecedented challenges to our multilateral institutions and urgently demanding analyses and strategies to confront them. The world financial crisis is affecting the very foundations of the international system. The provision of emergency financial relief may help individual countries, but it does not contribute to the health of the system as a whole, and it highlights the imperfections of the existing supervisory mechanisms. There is thus a need for a review of the Bretton Woods institutions and a revision of their policies so as to adapt them to current reality. The growing imbalance among countries in the economic and social areas is another deeply troubling element. The 1998 Human Development Report indicates that 20 per cent of the inhabitants of high-income countries consume 86 per cent of the worldâs goods and services. In contrast, the poorest 20 per cent consume less than 2 per cent. This reality underscores the urgent need to foster real sustainable human development throughout the world, as well as within our countries, which are confronting the challenge of relieving excruciating poverty. Not only is it urgently necessary to strengthen multilateral institutions and achieve friendly cooperation, but it actually can be done. A few indications of current positive trends are the worldwide consolidation of democracy, the recognition of the central value of individuals and their inherent rights, the participation of civil society, the need to modify patterns of consumption and production for the advancement of sustainable development, the development and dissemination of technology and the significant though as yet insufficient progress in the fight against drug-trafficking and the struggle against poverty. Understanding continues to grow among States regarding the concept of sustainable human development. For the past eight years, we Peruvians have been engaged in a process of national reconstruction and structural reform, the overriding aim of which is the eradication of poverty. 31 The Peruvian Government, under the leadership of President Alberto Fujimori, continues to implement a series of policies and programmes to improve the quality of life of all our citizens. The fundamental element of these efforts is the strategy for the fight against poverty. Our firm commitment to eradicating poverty is reflected in the national budget, which allocates more than 40 per cent to social spending. The national priority is the reduction of extreme poverty by 50 per cent â€” from 19 per cent to 10 per cent of the population â€” by the year 2000. Along the same lines, the Peruvian Government accords great importance to policies aimed at achieving gender equality and the full participation of women, population policies and policies for the protection of the most vulnerable: children, the elderly, the handicapped and internally displaced persons. In the year of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Peru remains committed to giving substantive meaning to its content, incorporating its principles in legislation and putting them into practice through education and information and by including them in policies of development. The protection and fostering of human rights is a priority and a duty for Peruvians, which is why we defend the universality, indivisibility, comprehensiveness and non-discriminatory application of human rights. My country has signed and ratified almost all the international instruments concerning human rights, both universal and regional. Consequently, we call upon those countries that still are not parties to the two International Covenants on human rights and to the American Convention on Human Rights to ratify them, not only in honour of the fiftieth anniversary but also so that they will be consistent with the principles they continually espouse in the international arena. The persistence of new non-military global threats â€” such as international terrorism, the intensification of organized crime, corruption and the problem of drugs â€” adds to the gravity of the present international situation. Peru, which has suffered from terrorist violence, knows that this barbarism constitutes an assault on the individual and on society as a whole. It aims to destroy democracy and fundamental freedoms, in addition to threatening the peace and security of nations. In consequence, we consider all terrorist acts a systematic and deliberate violation of human rights that cannot be justified by any ideology or for any other reason, and that they should therefore be treated only as criminal acts. Peru categorically condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and urges the international community to combat it vigorously. With the same determination, Peru reiterates that cases of international terrorism should be resolutely combated within the framework of international law. In 1990 there were 120 thousand hectares of coca in Peru. Today, in a spectacular decline, this has been reduced by half, and with it the number of peasant families linked to the coca economy. Through programmes of alternative development it is possible to avoid a resurgence in the supply of coca leaves. We therefore need to combine national efforts with international support to overcome a complex problem that is a matter of shared responsibility. In this regard, we are promoting debt-swap programmes for alternative development projects. We have also convened a donor consulting group, which will meet next November, sponsored by the Inter-American Bank, the Inter- American Commission for the Control of Drug Abuse and the European Union. As President Alberto Fujimori stated during the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the drug problem, â€œThe purpose of the meeting is to secure the complementary financial resources required to implement alternative development, prevention and rehabilitation programmes within the framework of anti-poverty policies and the sustainable management of natural resources.â€ (A/S-20/PV.2, p. 2) I strongly reaffirm that my country is committed to fighting drug-trafficking and its related effects until they are eradicated. The criminal structures of drug-trafficking cannot be given any respite during which they might reconstitute themselves. For this reason the international community must intensify its joint efforts to put an end to this scourge that affects humanity. Because Peru has recently experienced a crisis situation, we face major difficulties resulting from internally displaced communities. Throughout the world there has been a dramatic increase in the number of the internally displaced in recent years, which makes it essential to strengthen United Nations action in this sphere. Consequently, we declare before the General Assembly the urgent need to further deepen and expand the mandates, programmes and sources of funding for the systemâs specialized agencies and bodies, with the aim of 32 prioritizing assistance to those countries affected by this problem. Peru is a peace-loving nation which works for peace and rejects conflict; which aspires to strengthen political and economic cooperation with all countries and groups of countries in different regions, on the basis of common interests and mutual benefit. In the realm of peace and security, the international community must now unite against new tendencies towards nuclear proliferation and a growing number of internal conflicts and conflicts between States in various parts of the world. To this must be added conventional arms races and the hundreds of thousands of anti-personnel mines that are still deployed in the world, whose shocking and unjust consequences we all know. These facts together threaten to overwhelm the existing capacities of our countries and our international institutions. Peru vigorously supports general and complete disarmament under strict international control. This is both a necessary condition for peace and an ongoing task of our Organization. Deplorable recent developments in the sphere of nuclear proliferation underscore the urgency of perfecting the existing non-proliferation regimes and the imperative need for negotiations on nuclear disarmament to go forward. The proposed fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament will have to consider these questions on a priority basis. We Latin Americans now appreciate all the more the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which created in our region the first inhabited zone of the planet to be free of nuclear weapons, and we are continuing to develop ties of cooperation with other nuclear-weapon-free zones. My country was the first Latin American State to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and consequently rejects any kind of nuclear test anywhere in the world. The Convention on anti-personnel landmines is a positive sign of change on the international scene. This makes plain the humanitarian concerns that inspire the conscience of the world. We are pleased that it will enter into force in March 1999, and are particularly interested in its full implementation after that date. Accordingly, the international community will have to give its active cooperation and make the utmost effort to remove or destroy the mines already planted in every region of the world. Peru was one of the first countries to ratify the Ottawa Convention and it already begun to adopt its applicable provisions. We call upon all countries which have not yet done so to ratify or adhere to the Ottawa Convention as soon as possible, as a contribution to peace, security, human coexistence and the development of our peoples. We trust that those States which have already signed it but have not yet ratified it will comply with article 18 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, under which signatory nations must abstain from acts which would frustrate the purpose of the Ottawa Convention. We believe that the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace, Disarmament and Development in Latin American and the Caribbean, which has its headquarters in Lima, can contribute to promoting a culture of peace and strengthening the efforts towards disarmament in the region, including dealing with the problem of mines. In the foregoing scenario, the reform and strengthening of the United Nations system take on even greater importance. Change and adjustment lead to greater efficiency. The process of structural and functional reform of the United Nations, rendered imperative by globalization and changes on the international scene, makes it necessary to ensure the coherence of its programmes and activities and to transform the Organization into an agent of sustainable human development. We believe that it is appropriate and timely to continue our efforts to define the criteria that should guide reform of the Security Council. Decisions on this fundamental matter should necessarily be adopted on the basis of the broadest possible agreement and in the spirit and letter of the Charter of the United Nations, which would itself be revised. The modifications we desire aim towards a more representative and efficient world Organization. In that regard, this effort must not give way to confrontation and discord. Let us rather support all efforts directed towards allowing the Organization to respond to the real needs of all its Member States. 33 Peru pays tribute to the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations on their fiftieth anniversary and honours the memory of the men and women, soldiers, police and civilians, including Peruvian nationals, who have sacrificed their lives in this noble mission. The peacekeeping operations, in some of which my country took part, are emblematic of the responsibility that the Charter assigns to our Organization. We wish to reiterate, Mr. President, our best wishes to you and to the Assembly in this new period we are entering, which will surely have important implications for the international community.The urgency of the alarming situation in Afghanistan, particularly given the events of the past few months, requires me to explain why and how that situation continues to pose major threats to the peace and security of the world. There is an evil triangle that is haunting our region. This evil triangle has imprisoned and terrorized an entire nation. It has almost engulfed our region in a major confrontation. The spread of this evil triangle like a plague is about to contaminate the entire area, setting off alarm bells from the Far East to the Far West, even echoing in faraway capitals of the world. The evil triangle I am referring to is one between: first, the Pakistani military Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI); secondly, branches of international terrorism and drug traffickers operating from Afghanistan; and thirdly, the infamous Taliban militia. On 7 August 1998, two African capitals suffered major explosions, sending a shock wave of international terrorism throughout the world. The following day, nine Iranian diplomats and a journalist were ferociously gunned down inside the Consulate-General of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Mazar-i-Sharif. According to Amnesty International, from 8 to 10 August thousands of ethnic Hazara civilians were killed in Mazar-i-Sharif. On 21 August 1998, Lieutenant-Colonel Carmine Calo, Military Adviser to the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan, an Italian national, was brutally murdered by two Pakistani terrorists on assignment in Kabul. All of these shocking events have one thing in common: the implementation of an anachronistic socio-political agenda by means of destructive force and violence and the adventurous hegemony of the Pakistani army in the region. These things pose a direct threat to regional peace and security. Three major concerns — namely, terrorism, drugs and the violation of human rights — are originating in the Taliban-held areas of Afghanistan, but they are being instigated from across the border. During the twelfth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, on 3 September 1998 in Durban, South Africa, President Burhanuddin Rabbani brought these issues to the attention of the summit. In its paragraphs on terrorism the Final Document of the summit says it is imperative that no State organize, assist or participate in terrorist acts in the territories of other States or encourage activities directed towards such acts, including permitting the use of national territory or the soil of a neighbouring country for planning and training for such a purpose and or the financing of terrorist activities. Paragraph 153 of the Final Document states that the heads of State or Government solemnly reaffirmed their unequivocal condemnation of any political, diplomatic, moral or material support for terrorism. We fully agree with the generally expressed view that the global phenomenon of terrorism requires a collective and concerted response. Afghanistan, along with other members of the Non- Aligned Movement, also condemns the practice of recruiting, financing, training, using or supporting mercenaries as a violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Let us make it clear once again here that the Taliban are Pakistani mercenaries. 26 On 28 August 1998, pursuant to the deterioration of the situation stemming from a whole new series of military activities evidently directed by the cross-border ISI officers, the Security Council adopted an important resolution, 1193 (1998), for which President Rabbani voiced his firm support at the Durban summit. However, the response of the Taliban mercenaries and their cross-border patrons to the resolution — a major assault on Bamyan valley on 14 September, during which the most atrocious acts were committed against the civilian population of the valley — was yet another vow to continue their military agenda. Presently, the only country that takes pride in recognizing the Taliban and in fact urges others to do the same remains Pakistan. The Pakistani meddling in Afghanistan — which has direct consequences for Pakistan itself and the entire region — has best been summarized in the Pakistani daily The News on 25 September 1998. I quote: “North-West Asia is in great trouble and the Taliban are the catalyst behind it. The Taliban have not just dragged Iran and the Central Asian republics into the conflict, they have also pushed Pakistan into a tense relationship with all its Muslim neighbours. What was supposed to provide Pakistan with strategic depth' has turned into a quagmire. Islamabad is now faced with yet another critical choice between either cutting Taliban to size or siding with them against friendly neighbours.” The article continues, and I quote, “If somebody thinks that with the Taliban victory a lasting peace will be restored in Afghanistan and peace dividends will start flowing in, he is sadly mistaken.” Headlines such as “Crises push Pakistan to the brink of disaster” in the Washington Post of 26 September are early warnings about a state of affairs that will affect the entire region. In fact, when a fragile and vulnerable country like Pakistan involves itself in a great game, as the Afghani people say, it digs its own grave. Article 1 of the United Nations Charter calls for effective and collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to peace. Consistent with this, the Islamic State of Afghanistan, over the past three years, has repeatedly warned the international community of the mounting threat to regional peace and security posed by the Pakistani Government?s military intelligence service, (ISI), and its mercenaries, the Taliban, in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, these early warnings have all gone unheard. Today, the exacerbated situation in Afghanistan and its menacing implications for the region and beyond are exactly what we deserve. The international community must admit that it has done too little in the face of the increasingly bold and aggressive ISI policy towards Afghanistan and has gone too far with its policy of appeasement towards the Taliban in their fight against the rest of the world. The Security Council must determine the existence of this threat to peace, breach of the peace and act of aggression by Pakistan, and should take appropriate measures against the perpetrators in conformity with Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter. The alarming situation in Afghanistan requires definitive action by the Security Council. It is time that the presence of about 28,000 armed Pakistanis in Afghanistan was dealt with in accordance with Article 39 of the United Nations Charter. The Taliban?s obstinately rejectionist and intransigent attitude towards peace and human rights is well known to the international community. Let us recall once again how the Taliban?s retrograde militia, helped and patronized by their cross-border allies, visualize and conceive the events in Afghanistan. The Taliban have their own answer to every issue raised by the United Nations and the international community. When asked to establish a broad-based representative Government, the Taliban reply that they have brought many parts of Afghanistan under their military domination and that this is a broad-based representative Government. When requested to hold elections in Afghanistan, the Taliban state that elections are unIslamic. They say that other Muslim countries which adhere to the principle of elections have overlooked the true teachings of Islam. When told to respect human rights, the Taliban reply that they have their own standards for human rights. They say that human rights in other Muslim countries are not based on Islam. In response to constant appeals to respect the human rights of women and reopen girls? schools, the Taliban, quoted in The Washington Post of 25 September 1998, say that 27 “the countries that shout about freedom for women want to use them only for prostitution and entertainment until they get old and useless”. The Taliban say they know best what to do with women and girls. When asked to put an end to drug production and trafficking, the Taliban say that, though produced in Afghanistan, narcotics are consumed overseas. They also say that drug production and smuggling, operations which the Taliban and some Pakistani military officers jointly maintain, earn them profits. When asked to hold negotiations with the parties to the conflict, the Taliban, again quoted in The Washington Post, say that their first priority has been to disarm the opposition and that negotiations will follow only then. Peace has no place on the Taliban agenda. Even when Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, the Secretary-General?s Special Envoy, urged them to attend the face-to-face talks with us, held in Ashgabat on 5 April 1998, they did not participate. On 25 April 1998, the negotiations between both sides in Islamabad — under the supervision of the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) — were unilaterally abandoned by the Taliban and the ceasefire observed at the request of the United Nations and the United States was pre-emptively broken by a major Taliban offensive north of Kabul. Because of the failure of the Taliban?s military offensive, they returned the following day, 26 April, for further negotiations, but soon unilaterally and definitively abandoned the negotiations once more, as noted by the Secretary-General. In essence, the Taliban?s intransigence stems from their firm and stubborn conviction that the only solution is a military solution. This conviction is also indicative of the ideas of their Pakistani mentors, who are determined to dominate Afghanistan. Thus, any and all efforts to reach a peaceful solution have been intentionally thwarted. It came as a surprise to no one that the Taliban not only refused to attend the intra-Afghan gathering on 18 July 1998 in Bonn, Germany, which sought to initiate what was hoped would be the traditional grand assembly, or Loya jirgah, but also, one week earlier, condemned the all-Afghan gathering and launched major military operations, supported by the Pakistani air force, in northern Afghanistan. The Islamic State of Afghanistan strongly confirms the views that have been expressed in this Assembly for years that there is no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan. The withdrawal of foreign military and armed personnel and the return of the opposition to the negotiating table for a political dialogue aimed at achieving a lasting political settlement of the conflict, along with the formation of a fully representative, broad- based, multi-ethnic Government, are the main points that could ensure an environment of peace in Afghanistan and the entire region. We are proposing such an intra-Afghan dialogue without delay or precondition, on the basis of the following principles, which emanate from our national platform and international commitment to Article 2, paragraph 2 of the United Nations Charter, as well to as our tenets and culture. First, concerning the principles of Islam, the Islamic tenets and teachings are guidelines of supreme value, in compliance with which the future political system, the constitution and other laws shall be founded. Secondly, the principle of democracy and pluralism shall constitute the mainspring of the future political system to be formed in Afghanistan. Thirdly, concerning the principle of human rights, the observation of and respect for human rights — including the rights of women and girls to education, work and beneficial coexistence in harmony with the provisions of human rights instruments — are among the principles that shall be integral parts of any peace agreement. This shows our commitment as a member of the international community. Fourthly, the principle of elections and the delegation of authority to local government shall be incorporated into any peace agreement as urgent and necessary elements of confidence-building and as the realization of the will of the people. Local administrations and their leaders, including the members of provincial councils, shall all be elected. The central representative Government, to be equitably accommodating to all ethnic groups and segments of Afghan society, shall function constitutionally. Fifthly, as to the principles of permanent neutrality and independence, countries of the region and the international community shall recognize the permanent neutrality of Afghanistan. Afghanistan will never enter into any political or military alliance against any State and Afghan soil will not be used as a base for hostilities against another State. International relations shall be 28 conducted independently, in a manner consistent with the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Afghanistan shall actively participate in the processes of regional economic cooperation, transit and transport of trade. It shall be a good partner in the community of nations. The Islamic State of Afghanistan welcomes the meeting of the “Six plus Two” group, held at the level of Foreign Ministers in New York on 21 September 1998. Afghanistan fully agrees with the points of common understanding and expresses its firm support for the Secretary-General?s decision to send his Special Envoy, Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi, to the region. Afghanistan remains committed to giving his mission its full cooperation. The Islamic State of Afghanistan firmly supports the institutional reform of the United Nations, rightly referred to as a “quiet revolution” by the Secretary-General. Similarly, the establishment of a Development Account and the United Nations Fund for International Partnerships, among other innovations, deserve the support of Member States. However, the least developed countries and in particular those stricken by war, have to be given priority attention in this field. In their Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations, Member States promised to “give to the twenty-first century a United Nations equipped, financed and structured to serve effectively the peoples in whose name it was established”. (resolution 50/6) This has to include the institutional framework of the Organization, namely, a Security Council with working methods and a composition that better reflect today?s needs and realities. The Working Group that has been mandated to examine this question will soon start its sixth year of intensive discussions. These discussions cannot go on indefinitely. It is time to set a concrete agenda and to act if we want to meet the challenges of the next millennium. Afghanistan therefore supports an overall reform which would make the Security Council?s work more transparent and its composition more representative. This would mean permanent seats for the developing and the developed world, the latter to include global economic players such as Germany and Japan. At the same time, a sufficient number of non-permanent seats should be added to take into account the interests of smaller and medium-sized countries. The Charter therefore must be amended in order drastically to reduce the use of the right of veto, which is most undemocratic. The coming century requires a Security Council that conforms with the new landscape of the world.  Allow me first of all, on behalf of my country?s delegation, to convey to Mr. Opertti my warm congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. I am convinced that his wisdom and experience will ensure that we are successful in our work. I wish also to thank his predecessor, Mr. Udovenko, who guided the work of the last session so skilfully. I wish also to extend our appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his constant and tireless efforts to strengthen the universality of the United Nations, to enhance its credibility and to strengthen its ability to discharge its responsibilities despite a difficult international situation. On 16 July of last year, the Secretary-General presented to the Assembly his report entitled “Renewing the United Nations: a Programme for Reform” (A/51/950), which provides an overall scheme to 14 modernize the working methods of the Organization in order to give it fresh impetus and enhance its efficiency so that it is better capable of responding optimally to the growing needs of the international community on the threshold of the third millennium. In this regard, we are convinced that implementation of the measures to reform the Organization will assist it in achieving its aims and objectives, namely restoring peace and security to the world and strengthening international cooperation in such a way as to achieve the economic and social development of all nations and peoples. In line with this, the question of reform and expansion of the United Nations Security Council has, for several years, been discussed. In this connection, we would like to reiterate our support for the proposals aiming at enlarging the representative base of that key body in accordance with the norms of democracy, transparency and justice and with equitable geographical distribution, enabling it to reflect the universal nature of our Organization pursuant to Article 24 of the Charter. The threats facing today?s world are not all political or military in nature. Some of them are economic or social and call for prompt and practical solution. The scourge of drugs and psychotropic substances and the ravages resulting from their consumption, marketing and distribution are among the most serious challenges facing us today. In this connection, I wish to express my delegation?s satisfaction that awareness of the dangers inherent in this evil is steadily growing. This has been reflected in a very clear-cut fashion in the unanimous adoption, at the twentieth special session of the General Assembly held last June, of the Political Declaration and the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction. There is no doubt that international peace and security on the one hand and economic growth, social development and the eradication of poverty on the other are organically bound up one with another. The United Nations and its specialized agencies have provided many measures to impress this reality on all of us. This approach has been manifested in the adoption of a large number of programmes and recommendations stemming from important international conferences and forums organized in the last few years under the auspices of the United Nations. However, this enormous effort should be translated into concrete reality through a new mobilization based on partnership and solidarity. The first step should be to devote to these lofty objectives the tremendous resources allocated to the production, development and acquisition of all types of weapons of mass destruction. On this basis, we must likewise enable the developing countries to speed up effectively their pace of growth. To this end, donor countries should augment their official development assistance, increase flows of investments, put an end to the continuous deterioration in terms of commercial trade, and give the products of developing countries free access to their markets without any hindrance. Likewise, the debt problem, which constitutes a heavy burden for the economies of developing countries, should receive the attention that it deserves. The 1997 Human Development Report indicates that debt servicing on average absorbs a fifth of a developing country?s export earnings, which is a significant drain on its modest foreign currency reserves and thus compromises its ability to take part in international trade on an equal footing. In this context, we hope that the initiatives taken on the subject of the external debt of the poorest and most heavily indebted countries will make it possible to find a radical solution to this set of problems, which impedes these countries? development endeavours. Despite the magnitude of the challenges of development and the wide range of priorities involved, and despite an unfavourable world economic situation, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, under the enlightened leadership of the President of the Republic, Mr. Maaouya Ould Sid?Ahmed Taya, has taken significant steps towards comprehensive development aimed at raising our citizens? standard of living and at consolidating democracy and the rule of law in a climate of tranquillity, security and stability. On the political plane, therefore, pluralistic democracy in our country came to fruition with the holding on 12 December 1997 of pluralistic presidential elections, the second of their kind, in which several candidates participated in a spirit of healthy competition and a climate of political plurality and freedom of expression. Furthermore, the third municipal elections, scheduled for the end of this year, are being organized successfully. Alongside this democratic process, which embodies our people?s aspirations to fully exercise its rights, our country is engaged in a decisive struggle to eradicate poverty and to combat illiteracy and marginalization, for 15 we are convinced that genuine enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms cannot be fully achieved except through a sustained effort aimed at enhancing citizens? socio-economic and cultural level. We have created an agency to deal with human rights, poverty and integration. That agency is responsible for promoting the exercise of human rights and implementing the national strategy to combat poverty. The budgetary allocations earmarked for social expenditure are approximately 37 per cent of all public expenditure — almost double the level recommended by the World Summit for Social Development. The Islamic Republic of Mauritania is pursuing a foreign policy that is based on immutable principles aimed at fostering relations of good-neighbourliness, peaceful coexistence and strengthened regional and international cooperation. On the basis of these principles, my country attaches particular importance to the consolidation of stability and the containment of the large number of areas of tension around the world that are likely to threaten international peace and security and to jeopardize the development efforts of many nations and peoples. While reaffirming its full support for the peace process in the Middle East, my country believes that no just and lasting peace can be achieved in that region until Israel has withdrawn from all the occupied Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem, the Syrian Golan and the Lebanese territories, in conformity with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978) and the principle of land for peace. Such a peace cannot be attained until the Palestinian people have been enabled to establish their independent state on their territory with Al-Quds as its capital. In this respect, my country expresses its profound concern at the difficulties besetting the peace process and the negative developments that have taken place in the region. My country also calls for taking the measures necessary for restarting peace negotiations on all tracks, and urges the two sponsors of the peace process to make further efforts to preserve the chances for peace in that region. With respect to the Gulf region, we hope that all regional and international efforts will combine to bring about a return to stability and concord in the area. In this respect my country, while reaffirming its attachment and commitment to international legitimacy and United Nations resolutions, reiterates its repudiation of anything that could undermine the independence of Kuwait and its territorial integrity. It also reaffirms its consistent position of rejecting any measure likely to threaten the unity of Iraq and the integrity of its territory. At the same time, it calls for the lifting of the embargo imposed for seven years now on the Iraqi people. The Iraqis have been very hard hit by this embargo, whose impact has been first and foremost felt by women, children and the elderly. With respect to the Arab Maghreb, my country is acting, together with its sister countries of the Arab Maghreb Union, to develop cooperation and consultation, to respond to the aspirations of the peoples of the Maghreb. As to Western Sahara, my country expresses its satisfaction at the positive steps taken within the framework of the United Nations settlement plan and reiterates its readiness to do its utmost to facilitate its implementation. We call for the lifting of the embargo imposed on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. We hope that the recent positive developments will lead to finding a formula for a prompt settlement of this question, which has harmed the interests of the Libyan people. In many parts of Africa, the situation remains worrisome because of conflicts and civil wars, with the attendant torrent of human suffering and destruction. These crises, along with other crises around the world, should be given more sustained attention by the United Nations, since it is the international community that bears responsibility for containing them and for acting seriously and effectively to prevent their proliferation. My delegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict in Africa and on ways of promoting durable peace and sustainable development. We also welcome Security Council resolution 1170 (1998), adopted last May, which authorizes a number of mechanisms for the implementation of the recommendations contained in that report. We hope too that at its present session the General Assembly, when considering that report, will find ways and means of implementing the recommendations that fall within its purview. The Islamic Republic of Mauritania expresses its concern at the persistent conflict in Somalia and hopes that the Somalis will be able to find the path to 16 constructive dialogue, in order to bring about a settlement that will secure concord and stability in that country. In the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, we hope that the efforts undertaken by the League of Arab States and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) will lead to a solution that will preserve that country?s sovereignty and unity. In Guinea-Bissau, my country welcomes the truce agreement signed last 26 August and supports all the efforts and initiatives aimed at restoring security and stability. Similarly, my country urges Ethiopia and Eritrea to continue to comply with the ceasefire, in the hope that the efforts undertaken by the OAU will result in a fair settlement which will guarantee security and stability in the region. With respect to the Great Lakes region and the serious developments taking place there, my country supports all endeavours to promote a return to stability and to bring about the reconstruction of everything that has been destroyed by war and conflict there. Likewise, my country supports the regional and international endeavours to consolidate peace in Sierra Leone, so that that country may see the beginning of a new era of peace, stability, reconstruction and development. It is regrettable that there are many other regions of the world where there is instability and conflict. In the Balkan region, the situation in Kosovo continues to worsen, compounding the suffering of the population and boding ill with regard to future humanitarian disasters comparable to those experienced in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This calls for decisive international intervention to prevent the situation from worsening further. While war and conflict cause mass tragedies and mass destruction, the international community today is facing the phenomenon of terrorism, which cannot be contained within either time or place and which also threatens the peace and stability of all States and peoples. My country stresses its condemnation of terrorism in all of its forms, whatever its origins. We call for strengthening of cooperation and consultation at the international level in order to confront it resolutely and severely. The world of today witnesses a gigantic leap in the increase of wealth, improvement of means of production, evolution of telecommunications and the informatics revolution. Although the developments offer conditions of comfort and well-being, they do, however, widen the chasm which separates the development and growth levels of the developed and the developing countries. This will exist as long as cooperation, solidarity and partnership do not prevail, until nations and peoples can together benefit from the advantages of globalization, and until the international community is able to give an impetus to international relations based on peace, democracy, justice and sustainable development.   This year we are commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I should like therefore to congratulate Mr. Opertti very warmly upon his election to the presidency of this session. Finland will give him its full support in his demanding task. Finland aligns itself with the statement made by my Austrian colleague, Mr. Wolfgang SchÃ¼ssel, on behalf of the European Union. As has been mentioned in other statements, one of the catchwords of our time is globalization. We all should be ready to contribute to a constructive international dialogue aiming at improving the joint global responses to the various challenges emanating from this globalization. We have also done a lot. The United Nations has in the 1990s convened global conferences to enhance development in the fields of human rights, sustainable environmental development, population policies, social development, the advancement of women, food security, human settlements and the rights of the child. These conferences have set an ambitious global agenda to which Governments are committed. These commitments form a road map which guides the Governments, non- governmental organizations and individuals as well as the United Nations system. The question remains: can the United Nations deliver? Do we, the Member States, want our Organization to be able to deliver? And do we make it our own responsibility to realize our commitments? Then and only then can the United Nations deliver. And are we also able to see good partners? Democratic Member States and free, capable citizens and their organizations form a good basis for an international network of safety in the world of globalization. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights has been and is the basis for developing human rights. We should commemorate the Declaration in the daily activities of our Governments and common international institutions. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has emphasized that human rights are the basis for sustainable human development and for the sustainability of any community. I subscribe to his words and endorse his objective of knitting human rights into all United Nations activities. Adequate resources should be secured for this process. The universal nature of human rights should be beyond question and doubt. All women, men and children who enjoy or are demanding those rights are equal regardless of their nationality or cultural identity. This year, human rights are being made more widely and better known because there are still women, men and children who are not aware of their rights. Yet consciousness of oneâs rights is the basis for the rule of law, democracy, good governance and full enjoyment of human rights. Awareness-raising is the key to concrete results in the field of human rights. The Criminal Court will become an effective mechanism for the trial of war criminals, as well as a real deterrent against genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. It is particularly important that the Court make sure also that those individuals who are responsible for atrocities in connection with internal conflicts will be brought to justice. It is important that special provisions for the protection of women and children were included in the definition of war crimes and crimes against humanity as well as elsewhere in the Statute. The Criminal Court should keep this in mind in its everyday work. As the experience of the two ad hoc tribunals shows, special expertise is needed for that purpose. In this connection, let me emphasize that Finland also strongly supports the finalization of an optional protocol on children in armed conflicts based on an age limit of 18 years. The suffering inflicted on children by conflicts is intolerable. It is high time to act. We have once again been reminded that terrorism constitutes a growing threat to human beings, internal and international security and the functioning of democratic institutions. Within the framework of the United Nations, important work has been done in the fight against terrorism. A sustainable response to terrorism can be found only through intensified efforts within the United Nations and improved operational cooperation between States. In this regard, I want to stress that the fight against terrorism should be carried out in accordance with relevant international instruments, including those related to human rights. Finland calls for ratification and full implementation of the international conventions on the suppression of terrorism and an early finalization and acceptance of the convention on the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism. 25 Another way to secure our global neighbourhood is to continue disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. The ongoing efforts of the international community were challenged by the nuclear test explosions by India and Pakistan. Finland deplored these actions. Now it is important to prevent a nuclear arms race in South Asia. We call on India and Pakistan to confirm their promises not to test again through adherence to the Comprehensive Nuclear- Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The CTBT remains a strong and dynamic cornerstone of the global security system. It serves the interests of all States. Finland welcomes the agreement to begin negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament on a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. A cap on the production of fissile material will serve both nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Conventional weapons are increasingly included in disarmament efforts. Finland warmly welcomes this development. In several conflict areas, the accumulation of weapons is threatening the very existence of nations. We welcome the entry into force of the Ottawa Convention on anti-personnel landmines following the fortieth ratification last week. The issue of small arms is acute. Readily available and easy to use, small arms are the main tools of violence in todayâs conflicts. The world community needs to respond to the problem of small arms through both enhanced global and regional cooperation. Member States need to control their exports and other transfers of small arms. But that is not enough. An integrated approach involving measures addressing both security and development of societies is required. Finland supports a lead role for the United Nations on the issue of small arms. We look forward to the recommendations next year by the United Nations panel on small arms. On the opening day of this session due tribute was paid to the women and men who have served during the past 50 years in United Nations peacekeeping operations. The Organization has a unique role in peacekeeping. Finland reiterates its firm support and commitment to this essential function of the United Nations in global collective security. The world needs the peacekeeping and peace- building capability of the United Nations. We have to strengthen the capacity of the Organization in these fields. Finland calls upon Member States to secure financing for this purpose. Attacks against unarmed United Nations personnel and humanitarian workers are increasing. This trend has to be reversed. Parties to any conflict must respect international humanitarian law. We have the global agenda, and the commitments are there. For implementation we need a strong United Nations. The Secretary-Generalâs reform package must be implemented without delay. The proposals for reform in the economic and social sector need to be realized. It is also high time to enter into real negotiations on the reform of the Security Council. All we need is political will. The reform process must lead to a strengthened and more efficient United Nations. Finland values the reforms undertaken by the Secretary General, Kofi Annan. We highly appreciate his leadership as the head of this Organization, and we continue to support him in his endeavours. Member States must provide the United Nations with sufficient means. They must fulfil their financial obligations towards the United Nations, in full, on time and without conditions. Without a sound financial basis even the efforts at reforming the United Nations are bound to fail. Finland also calls for better cooperation and coordination of development activities both within the United Nations system and between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions. An efficient implementation of the global agenda requires more coherent approaches from the different actors in the field of development. Todayâs global, regional and local problems have their economic, environmental and social dimensions. A large-scale problem of a developmental, ecological or humanitarian nature may even turn into an armed conflict. Intertwined problems call for integrated responses. We have good examples of integrated approaches in southern Africa, as well as in Guatemala and in El Salvador. Peace agreements and operational agendas include agreements on human rights, identity and the rights of indigenous people, social and economic aspects and strengthening of civilian power, as well as defining the role of the armed forces. Constitutional reforms and electoral regimes are also essential, as is monitoring of the functioning of the courts as a prerequisite for the reform of judicial systems. We also see the importance of good governance. We must secure the future of the United Nations, in terms not only of finance but of political support as well. Here Governments and the Organization can benefit from 26 public interest in the United Nations. We attach high expectations to the Millennium Assembly and to the role and participation of civil society in the Millennium Forum. The Forum can give us guidance from all sectors of our societies on which way to continue. I take particular pleasure in extending to Mr. Didier Opertti and to his country, Uruguay, my congratulations on his election to preside over the work of this session of the General Assembly. His eminent qualities, as well as his diplomatic experience, will undoubtedly ensure the success of our work. I also express my deep appreciation for the wise leadership his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, imprinted on the work of the fifty-second session, thus contributing to the positive results achieved. My country appreciates highly the creativity and the intellectual energy brought to United Nations affairs by Secretary-General Kofi Annan since he took over, and we particularly appreciate his efforts to streamline United Nations structures. My Government fully supported the United Nations programme of reforms aimed at conferring more coherence and efficiency on the activities of the United Nations. We have no doubt that the streamlining of the United Nations administration will have a positive impact on the way the Organization handles the various and complex issues confronting the international community. The efforts made over recent years by the international community, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the African subregional organizations and by States individually to deal with the conflicts in the African continent have produced some positive results, some of them remarkable. This has contributed to the restoration of peace and the return to normalcy in several of the affected countries. However, the resurgence of new conflicts and the reappearance of other conflicts which we believed had already been resolved raise serious concerns, particularly because of the threat they pose to peace and stability even beyond national borders. This situation raises the spectre of disastrous consequences for the populations? well-being and security and casts a shadow over the much-needed economic and social development of the affected countries. A strong commitment is required on the part of the international community to find ways and means to deal effectively with the armed conflicts in the African continent. In Africa, as in any other region of the world, internal conflicts arise whenever individuals or groups of people have no channels through which they can funnel their legitimate claims through peacefully and democratically. In the end, the non-existence of dialogue, the practice of intolerance and the absence of reliable judicial means to deal with divergences are the shortest path to armed conflict. 14 In his recent report to the Security Council on this matter, the Secretary-General made a substantial contribution to the understanding of the causes of conflict in our continent and their relationship to development, good governance, democracy and human rights. Maintaining peace in fact becomes a difficult task when we witness the deepening of social gaps; while the overwhelming majority of the population has difficulty obtaining the essentials; when fundamental rights of populations or parts of them, including the right to participate in the governance of their country, are not recognized or respected; or when citizens or groups of citizens are discriminated against on the basis of ethnic, cultural, religious or political considerations. This situation is compounded by the temptation of outside interference aimed at imposing policies or exerting influence on Governments — most of the time causing or aggravating conflict situations. The virus of violence and conflicts that plagues African regions and countries thrives in the precarious living conditions of millions of Africans and the non- recognition in practice of the most fundamental rights of citizenship. Whenever one faces rampant famine, illiteracy, ignorance, illness and oppression, whenever human dignity is not secured by the lofty ideals of full-fledged democracy, or whenever the respect for human rights is not widely upheld, then peace, stability and progress are in question. It is evident that if one wants to reduce the occurrence of armed conflicts it is imperative to uphold respect for the fundamental rights of citizenship, tolerance and social justice and to support the creation of better living conditions that comes with economic development. The United Nations, as the main guarantor of peace in the world, has a major role to play in the mobilization of the resources and political will needed to confront African countries? colossal needs and overcome the prevalent situation of underdevelopment and intolerance, which in the end favour the occurrence or persistence of armed conflicts. However, it must be recognized that it is up to African States, their leaders — especially those that hold the reins of power — and their respective civil societies to assume courageously their responsibilities, particularly in respect of the promotion of the sound and fair management of their resources, the consolidation of democratic institutions, the observation of and respect for the rights of citizenship and the creation of a climate of tolerance and respect for the dignity and liberty of the human person. The sisterly country of Guinea-Bissau has gone through a difficult period in her history over the last two months, as it has been faced with an internal armed conflict. My country, which together with the other Portuguese-speaking countries shares with Guinea-Bissau a long common history, has been following with particular attention the situation unfolding in that sisterly country and has not spared any effort in contributing to the search for a political and negotiated solution to the crisis. In the framework of the Community of Portuguese- Speaking Countries (CPLP) Contact Group, which we have the honour to be coordinating, we will continue to give our best efforts to support a peaceful resolution of the crisis, and we hope that the joint mediation initiative of the CPLP and the Economic Community of West African States will come to play an efficient and decisive role in the ongoing peace process. We hope that the parties to the conflict will continue to strictly observe the ceasefire agreement signed at Praia on 25 August and will also continue to show tolerance to enable Guinea-Bissau society to be reconciled soon. The difficult situation prevailing in Angola, a country to which we are bound by profound brotherly ties and a long common history, demands a strong and decisive commitment on the part of the international community in order to restore as soon as possible compliance with the obligations entered into in the framework of the Lusaka Protocol, while bearing in mind the relevant Security Council resolutions. Of particular concern to my country is the spectre of new armed confrontations in Angola, raised by UNITA?s regrettable defiance. The brotherly people of Angola, who for many years have been victimized by the prevailing situation of war, have the right to peace, political stability and a much-needed national reconciliation. The current international financial crisis that recently shook the economies of many countries, especially in Asia, seems to raise increasing concerns for all of us. It raises doubts about prospects for continuing the global prosperity which, fuelled by economic growth, once seemed so long-lasting. The former optimistic outlook has lately been called into question, especially in respect to developing nations, by a series of financial setbacks that 15 pose a threat to social stability, cohesion and peace in the affected countries. The rapid degradation of economies considered to be healthy and in full expansion only months ago has been the object of the special attention and concern of many that have spoken from this rostrum in the last few days. The fear and apprehensions that the stability of many States may be affected negatively by the fallout resulting from the dynamics of globalization raise justifiable concern, particularly about the speculative attacks against the economies of certain developing nations or the maintenance of not so transparent management practices. At question is the equilibrium of the world economy, the disturbance of which may have disastrous consequences — economic and otherwise — for all of us. The ongoing democratization process taking place at different rhythms in different countries could fall prey to this situation. It could also lead to social and political instability and give rise to risks to peace and security. It is illusory to believe that the negative impact of such an economic situation could be contained within the boundaries of developing nations, since the phenomenon of globalization seems to have created its own dynamics and knows no boundaries. The destinies of our countries, large and small alike, industrialized or developing, are increasingly interlinked. Therefore, it is imperative that collectively we find effective solutions that facilitate the end of the crisis, promote growth on a global scale and secure a sustainable rhythm of social and economic development. As a country severely affected by drought and desertification, Cape Verde pays special attention to the environment. The environmental issues confronting mankind, as well as of the relationship between man and nature, make it incumbent upon us to act in a swift, efficient and global manner so as to guarantee the preservation of the basic conditions that make life possible on Earth. Our primary task should be to find a global strategy that will maintain the balance of our ecosystems and at the same time secure the betterment of living conditions for the world?s population. However, this is easier said than done. Cape Verde shares the view that, in order for us to confront the problem of environmental degradation, we should take a new approach to the dynamics of economic and social development, an approach that focuses on the eradication of poverty. Until this is done, not much can be achieved in this regard, at least not in the developing countries. Against this background, my Government has been enacting various pieces of legislation to bring the issue of the environment into its legal mainstream. However, whatever legislative measures we and other developing countries may enact, in order to reap the expected environmental benefits, resources should be made available by the international community to allow developing nations to build their capacity to implement their own environmental programmes in a sustained manner. The end of the cold war seemed to have created a new dynamic for the issue of poverty through the Agenda for Development. Awareness of this issue seems to have been strengthened, since we cannot remain indifferent to the extreme poverty that severely afflicts more than a quarter of the planet?s inhabitants. The spirit of solidarity that guided the Copenhagen Summit must today be reflected in a gamut of concrete actions aimed at supporting the huge efforts of developing countries in their struggle against poverty, the creation of conditions for sustainable development and, consequently, the general improvement of people?s living conditions. Cape Verde, within the framework of the engagement undertaken at that Summit, has been adopting the necessary measures to combat poverty in the country. Nevertheless, like other developing nations, especially those on the list of least developed countries, we find that our internal efforts will not produce the expected results without additional measures on the part of the international community. We believe that the special follow-up meeting to take place in the year 2000 should be the occasion for a thorough assessment of the situation and for the launching of concrete action targeted at the effective implementation of the engagements undertaken at the Copenhagen Conference. By the same token, I cannot but emphasize the issue of small island States, which, as is known, have special challenges and vulnerabilities, a global assessment of which will be made next year, in keeping with the Barbados Programme of Action. It is expected that the international community will commit itself to concrete measures with a view to implementing the engagements undertaken under that Programme, which is of particular importance for the sustained development of the small island States. 16 As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the international community should seize the occasion to make a detailed assessment of the global performance in protecting and realizing all the rights of the human person. To this end, an assessment of the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action over the last five years would contribute much. It should be borne in mind that the protection and promotion of all human rights constitutes a major challenge to mankind as we approach the next millennium. Regrettably, throughout the world, political, ethnic or religious intolerance, as well as armed conflicts, have brought untold misery to millions of people whose fundamental rights have been violated, including the fundamental right to life. Special emphasis, in this regard, should be put on the right to development, a fundamental human right which, by its very nature, conditions the degree and the modus of realization of the other human rights — political, civil, social, cultural and economic rights. Much talk has been heard on the issue of human rights. It is not enough, however, to proclaim such rights or to brag about them without at the same time ensuring the conditions, including the economic conditions, for their effective implementation, a task that especially requires action on the part of the United Nations system and the international community in general. The people of East Timor are still deprived of their fundamental rights, especially the inalienable right to dispose of their own destiny. Cape Verde, in keeping with the United Nations principles it has always upheld, once again emphasizes the need for the observance of and respect for the right of self-determination of the East Timorese people, and encourages the efforts undertaken by the international community, under the authority of the Secretary-General, with a view to protecting and promoting human rights in that territory, and finding a lasting solution that is acceptable. As we approach the next millennium, our countries are faced with daunting challenges, and the Organization, which has unequivocally scored some successes, should be capable of coping with a rejuvenated role, one which should be increasingly more humane and reflecting more solidarity, aimed at the effective implementation of the lofty ideals that are its foundation.  At the outset, I am pleased to extend to Mr. Opertti my sincere congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. I am confident that his experience and skill will help ensure that we achieve the best results possible in our proceedings this session. I should also like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for his 5 notable success in guiding the proceedings of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session. It am also pleased to express thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his unceasing efforts to reform the United Nations and to enhance its credibility while strengthening its role in maintaining world peace and security. The aspirations of the world?s peoples and States to achieve stability based on security, peace, prosperity and advancement, which are basic objectives of the international community, impose upon us the duty, year after year, to take a realistic account, in this international forum, of the configurations of international realities for which the United Nations serves as the most credible gauge and the most comprehensive reference point for changes in various fields. This would enable us to assess together how close we are to, or how far we are from, our basic human objectives. Developments in recent months and weeks in various parts of the world, and their implications and effects at different international levels, have demonstrated that, despite all the efforts made, this world is a long way from achieving the stability desired. They also demonstrate that no single Power, nation or bloc, however powerful or influential, can distance or protect itself from instability, which is rampant in the world, unless situations in the north, south, east and west are approached in a unified, consensual and fair manner and with balance and interdependence. This must be done in order to radically solve problems and issues, addressing their root causes and avoiding double standards and partial or temporary solutions, and without deferring seemingly chronic problems that are bound to rear their heads again in one form or another. The failure of the international community to take proper advantage of the end of the cold war has been made manifest by the nuclear arms race erupting in Asia, obstacles in the Middle East peace process, the rise of terrorism and other acts of violence committed indiscriminately in various parts of the world, as well as the worsening of economic crises in several regions. The international situation is once again precarious, and it is incumbent upon all of us to treat these matters comprehensively, and with greater firmness and determination. The increased gravity of the phenomenon of terrorism on the one hand, and the divergence of views regarding that phenomenon on the other, underline the need for greater international understanding and more effective joint coordination. This calls for the need to convene an international conference at the highest possible level to combat terrorism, for it is illogical to condemn terrorism at one level, while giving haven to persons involved in it at another level. Such an enormous task cannot be undertaken by any single State or bloc alone, whatever resources it may have. Thus we are once again faced with an enormous and renewed responsibility placed on the shoulders of our international Organization, which has now been required, in the light of the new conditions and the profound changes in the international environment, to adopt effective and unconventional working methods so as to confront these new and unprecedented situations in the history of humankind. This bestows a renewed importance and should also give new impetus to both the United Nations reform programme put forward by the Secretary-General last year and to approaches to reactivating the performance of the Security Council in line with more effective formulas for its restructuring and functioning which may be acceptable to the international community within the United Nations. These formulas should take into account equitable geographical distribution and an appropriate increase in the Council?s membership, commensurate with the increase in the Organization?s membership. Bahrain takes pride in the fact that at present it is the representative of the Asian Group in the Security Council. Experience has shown that the end of an era, or victory in a confrontation, does not mean the end of crises or confrontations in the world, and that continuous international vigilance and permanent joint action are indispensable if we are to avoid inertia and prevent the recurrence of such crises. Creative visions and innovative methods to deal with new challenges are required. That does not mean that we have reached the end of history, as some have imagined. Rather, it means that we have reached an unprecedented phase of history on the practical and political plane of the international situation. Insofar as the theoretical and intellectual aspects are concerned, it is a fact that — however numerous may be the views and interpretations in research and discussions in the world?s different cultures and civilizations that have captured the attention of the world in an unprecedented manner in respect of the “globalization” phenomenon and its dimensions and possible impacts, both positive and negative — the United Nations, established over half a century ago, remains the indisputable mother institution for this phenomenon. The United Nations represents an early concretization of globalization in world history, 6 despite the fact that globalization was not then as mature or comprehensive as it is today. If there is to be a global focal point qualified to carry out balanced and objective research on the dimensions of this phenomenon whose impact is yet to be agreed upon, this international Organization should be the common melting pot for the various visions and diverging interpretations concerning the globalization of the international scene, irrespective of the cultural, intellectual and spiritual directions of their proponents. This should also be achieved in a manner whereby the fashionable phrase “clash of civilizations” can be transcended and replaced by harmony and dialogue. Should the United Nations, with its institutions and intellect, be unable to absorb this international phenomenon and its consequences for human and international reality, this may lead to a different global reality that is incompatible with the spirit and philosophy of the Organization. The result of such a situation might in the long run become difficult to contain and control within the bounds of international legitimacy and existing international cooperation, as attested to by the increase in acts of terrorism and the breaches of established norms in more than one field. It goes without saying that the United Nations will be unable to meet historical and future obligations of this magnitude, without adequate support from all its Member States, whether at the level of financial obligations, practical facilities or, more importantly, political support for its programmes and plans. In the final analysis, the United Nations is merely the sum total of the joint political will of Member States. This sum total, be it positive or negative, is but an expression of the capacity of that political will to undertake joint international action. In spite of the apprehensions and risks that loom over the international horizon, the future for the third millennium is laden with promises, hopes and potentials that are worthy of sacrifice and hard work for the sake of a better future. Accruing scientific and technological advancement, the increasing speed of communications and the information revolution, the spread of free trade and the deepening interaction among nations, cultures and civilizations are all harbingers of a better world for all mankind. As it witnesses these positive new developments on the world scene, Bahrain, with its deep-rooted civilization, is hardly a stranger to this. Five thousand years ago, Bahrain was one of the most important commercial ports in the world. By virtue of its openness, based as it was on freedom of commerce, it constituted a meeting place for cultures and human thought. Since that early time, by symbolizing the heritage of the old world regarding coexistence and interaction between human contributions, it became qualified to be an island for peace and to be a civic and spiritual centre in its natural and human environment in the Arabian Gulf. The existing legacy of its old civilization bears witness to that. Consequently, and since the beginning of its current renaissance, Bahrain has sought to meet the requirements of modern advancement in the areas of administration and management, educational and cultural enlightenment and the creation of an open and civilized society that is capable of evolution based primarily on the Bahraini individual?s innovation, capabilities and basic rights to a free and honourable life. It has thus become a model for balanced modernization that preserves the traditions of our region of the world. By virtue of this distinctive role, the State of Bahrain, small in size as it is, today bears a hefty regional and international responsibility on three levels simultaneously: first, in its capacity as the financial and banking centre of one of the world?s most important economic areas; secondly, in its capacity as a fundamental link at the forefront of the joint defence strategy of that vital region of the world — as has been the case continuously over the last half-century, coinciding with the history of the United Nations; and thirdly, in its capacity as a social, cultural and civic model that has, since the beginning of this century, been open to modern thought and reforms and to progressive human development for both men and women equally in various fields of education and work, and in responsible social and national partnership. This has been reflected in this year?s United Nations Development Programme Human Development Report. That report placed Bahrain first in the Arab world for the fourth consecutive year, for its achievements in human development. Furthermore, the accomplishments in the field of economic and industrial development in Bahrain reflect model diversification of the means of production, which goes beyond an exclusive dependence on oil. As it takes part in the United Nations celebrations marking the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Bahrain in fact does so as a reflection of its real and historic contribution to the 7 building of the social, educational and developmental foundations for these basic human rights — the very core of the general structure of society — in a manner that transcends slogans and efforts to politicize this venerable human issue. In addressing this issue, due consideration should be given to the historical and legislative peculiarities and values of every society, religion and culture, so that the outlook of one system cannot predominate over the legitimate and unique outlook of another. The United Nations played a positive role in defusing the crisis between Iraq and the international inspection teams earlier this year. The State of Bahrain welcomed the Memorandum of Understanding reached between the Secretary-General and the Iraqi Government. In view of our keen interest in the preservation of security and peace in the Gulf region, we applaud the effective role undertaken by the Secretary-General in defusing the crisis and sparing the region from dangerous ramifications and consequences. We wish to reaffirm the need for Iraq to continue fulfilling its international obligations concerning the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and the release of Kuwaiti and other prisoners of war and detainees. Any progress in this respect should be recognized as a first step towards the alleviation of the suffering of the brotherly Iraqi people. The State of Bahrain has always emphasized the need for ensuring the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq and the rejection of any interference in its internal affairs. The continued occupation by the Islamic Republic of Iran of the three islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb, which belong to the United Arab Emirates, remains a cause of concern to the State of Bahrain and the other sister members of the Gulf Cooperation Council. We hope that ongoing contacts between the sisterly United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran will lead to the settlement of the question of these islands by means of serious bilateral negotiations and other available peaceful means for the settlement of disputes among States through reconciliation. As far as the general situation in the Gulf is concerned, we, of course, welcome the easing of tension and the progress toward rapprochement and dialogue between the States members of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Islamic Republic of Iran as being in the interest of all their peoples and of the preservation of peace in that region. The painful events in the Gulf region during the last two decades explain why the question of regional security remains one to which the State of Bahrain accords the utmost importance in view of its serious ramifications and repercussions in relation to the security, stability and safety of the States and peoples of the region. The territorial and boundary claims currently seen in the Gulf region, which aim at changing established and traditionally accepted boundaries, upset the security and stability of the region. In our view, the optimal and most judicious course for avoiding that scenario is to respect the status quo, to refrain from all claims, total or partial, and to settle any related differences by peaceful means acceptable to the parties to the dispute. The establishment of relations among the States of the region on the basis of good-neighbourliness, mutual respect, non-interference in the internal affairs of others and recognition of every State?s national sovereignty are also fundamental elements for the maintenance of security and stability in the region. Regarding the Middle East peace process, this year has not witnessed any positive developments or progress, despite all the efforts to move the process forward. We believe that the lack of progress in the peace process will lead to an escalation of tension, extremism and violence in the region. Having supported the peace process since its very beginnings at the Madrid Conference as a strategic option for the achievement of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region, Bahrain is deeply concerned at the stalemate in the peace process resulting from the Israeli Government?s insistence on following policies of procrastination, non-compliance with commitments previously agreed upon with the Palestinian Authority, and construction of more settlements both in Holy Jerusalem and in the Syrian Golan. That is in addition to the continued confiscation of land in the occupied Palestinian territories. Therefore, we call upon the international community, and in particular the two co- sponsors of the peace process, to intensify efforts to rescue the faltering process, prevent its failure and put it back on the right course on all tracks so that just and comprehensive peace may be attained on the basis of the principle of land for peace, the return to their owners of the Palestinian territories, including in the first place Holy Jerusalem, recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent State of its own on its national territory, complete withdrawal by Israel from the occupied Syrian Arab Golan to the borders that existed on 4 June 1967, in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), and the unconditional withdrawal from occupied southern Lebanon in accordance with Council resolution 425 (1978). With regard to the question of disarmament relevant to weapons of mass destruction, it should be recalled that 8 Israel continues to avoid accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and a commitment to end a nuclear arms race in the region. Such a position is apt to force other States to enter such a race, as has happened in South Asia, and as could happen anywhere in the world. This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the world?s multilateral trading system. Since the system was established, numerous rounds of multilateral trade negotiations contributed to the creation of the World Trade Organization. We hope that the forthcoming round of trade negotiations, expected to begin before the end of the century, will lead to the creation of an environment conducive to the development and diversification of world trade, and to the enhancement of economic and commercial cooperation among States on the basis of equality and reciprocal benefits. The financial crisis that has afflicted a number of States and regions has caused economic tremors and has visibly affected the economies of numerous States, thus affirming the interdependence of the world economic system. In view of the consequences of this crisis, the international community must pay special attention to the treatment of economic factors that have a bearing on world growth rates and find effective solutions to them. It is our view that dialogue and cooperation between States of the North and of the South with a view to addressing world economic conditions would enhance world economic stability, lead to a greater flow of financial resources for development purposes and solve problems related to indebtedness, transfer of technology and the promotion of international investment. Environmental issues constitute a challenge that will face mankind during the twenty-first century. Concerted international efforts will be called for to address and prevent the dangers related to that challenge. Accordingly, the State of Bahrain has endorsed the Protocol adopted by the third session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held last December at Kyoto, Japan. We look forward to the fulfilment by the developed countries of their obligations under that Protocol. On the threshold of the twenty-first century, we view assertion of the importance of one civilization at the expense of others as incongruous at the dawning of a new era, an era based on peaceful coexistence between civilizations, their integration, their mutual enrichment, and their interaction with one another on an equal footing. The experience of the United Nations since its establishment has shown that variety and diversity of cultures are means towards fusion and harmony rather than towards antagonism and divisiveness. Therefore, it is incumbent upon us, during the forthcoming period, to build relations among all nations, peoples, States and cultures on the basis of cooperation, consensus and understanding, rather than confrontation, hegemony or collision. Let us together promote close and enduring ties among peoples and cultures in a world of interdependence and fraternity. Let national and cultural pluralism be elements of fruitful solidarity and mutual understanding in the creation of an era of peace and tranquillity. This Organization, which over the last 50 years has guided mankind towards better understanding and greater cooperation and coordination, is capable of pursuing its historic role and undertaking a positive role in the ongoing evolution of the international community throughout the next century. It is thus no exaggeration to say that the world has never before witnessed as historic a juncture as this, where it needs a joint international vision and concerted international action with a view to crossing to the shore of safety for which we all yearn.  Allow me to begin by expressing our sorrow at the loss of human life and the material damage caused by the inclemencies of nature in our sister nations of the Caribbean. We feel the greatest solidarity with them and urge the international community quickly and generously to provide them with emergency assistance to deal with this crisis. We would like to extend to you, Sir, our sincere congratulations on your election to preside over this session of the General Assembly. We are particularly delighted by your election, as we enjoy excellent relations of friendship and cooperation with your country. We would also like to extend our thanks to your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his work in promoting the objectives of the United Nations, particularly in the area of encouraging reform of this Organization. We extend our thanks to the Secretary-General for his excellent work in discharge of his mandate in an extremely complex international situation in which a great variety of interests are represented. This will be my last participation here as President of the Republic of El Salvador, and I should therefore like to reiterate our appreciation to this Organization for having been a decisive factor in the signing and verification of the Peace Accords that ended the armed conflict in El Salvador. From the beginning of our Administration, we declared our political will and our Government?s commitment to comply fully with the Peace Accords, and we are pleased to say we have done so, despite the difficulties and obstacles encountered along the way. We can say that profound transformations have taken place in El Salvador, resulting in the replacement of authoritarianism, abuse of power and impunity by a system founded on strict respect for the law and the principles and values of democracy. The restoration of peace and the consolidation of democracy have enabled the state of law in El Salvador to be strengthened, guaranteeing full independence for the basic organs of the Government of our Republic, as well as respect for the rights of the individual. We have also been able to proceed with a strategy of economic and social development with emphasis on the eradication of the underlying causes of poverty. El Salvador now has a solid economy that is growing progressively and is internationally recognized and trusted. We are carrying out a successful plan for modernizing the country, seeking greater efficiency, productivity and competitiveness; one important component of this approach is the elimination of State monopolies through the privatization of such sectors as energy, telecommunications and social security. We are implementing an economic policy of promoting our exports and attracting foreign investment, with a view to stimulating production, creating more jobs and making better use of the opening of international markets. We have focused on programmes for promoting human resources and the progress of communities, especially in the neediest and most vulnerable sectors of society. To this end, we have allocated increasing percentages of our national budget to education, health and housing. As part of our strategy for fighting against poverty, the National Department for the Family is carrying out support programmes for women, children and the elderly. Because we attach great importance to the ecology, we have established a Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources and we have now adopted a special law on this issue, in the aim of seeking solutions to the serious environmental problems facing our country and the world. We are pleased to report that currently we are carrying out consultations across the country on the conclusion of a draft basic agreement for a national plan, involving the general agreement of all the various representative sectors of El Salvador?s society. Our greatest hope is that the national plan will encourage participation by all Salvadoran men and women in a common long-term undertaking in which the interests of all are intertwined, without distinctions or political or ideological conditions, and which will be established as the nation?s second great political agreement, after the Peace Accords. El Salvador fully supports Central American integration, and along with the other Governments and private sectors in the region we are updating our legal instruments and strengthening the institutions that make up this system of regional integration. From a multilateral perspective, we can say that we have participated in and supported the declarations and plans of action adopted at international summits and conferences, responsibly shouldering our commitments in the areas of environment, human rights, social issues, development of women, rights of the child, population and the fight against drug abuse, inter alia. The profound changes that have taken place in recent years have had a strong impact on the international system, including the United Nations, resulting in agreement on the need for restructuring so as to respond properly to and solve global problems, particularly those of the developing countries. We believe that Member States must join forces, act in solidarity with each other, shoulder their responsibilities and reach agreements to promote the changes that are needed in the United Nations so that it can fully discharge its mandate. We support implementation of the Secretary- General?s proposals to complete the restructuring of the Secretariat, and we advocate a change in attitude so that there can be real reform in the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies. We need a Security Council that is more transparent, democratic and representative, so that it can enjoy the support of all Members of the Organization, and accordingly can become more effective in adopting practical and efficient measures to prevent and resolve conflicts. We are pleased that progress has been made in the political situation worldwide, but we must express our concern over the fragile state of peace and stability in some parts of the world as a result of continuing conflict, failure to implement agreements, deadlocks and possible breakdowns in peace processes, acts of terrorism, hostility and lack of trust among States. We are concerned about the deadlock in the peace process in the Middle East, and we urge the parties to seek a swift solution in accordance with the agreements made. 2 The Preamble to the Charter states that the peoples of the United Nations are resolved to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to unite their strength for the maintenance of international peace and security. Unfortunately, not all Member States are convinced of this or ready to put into practice these ideas so as to achieve the objectives that are of concern to us all. The recent nuclear tests run counter to our efforts to achieve a world free from nuclear weapons. We have supported every initiative to ensure a safer world for our peoples, and, in a spirit of international solidarity, I am pleased to report that earlier this month El Salvador deposited its instrument of ratification on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We believe that terrorism in any of its manifestations is an affront to the civilized principles of the human race and constitutes criminal conduct, which we strongly condemn and which cannot be justified on political, ideological, philosophical, ethnic or religious grounds. We accordingly condemn the terrorist attacks in Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa and Northern Ireland, which took innocent lives, wounded thousands and destroyed property. That is why we support Security Council resolution 1189 (1998), which calls on all States and international institutions to cooperate with and provide support and assistance to investigations with a view to bringing to justice those who planned and carried out those reprehensible acts. The Government of El Salvador recognizes and supports the efforts of the international community strongly to fight against drug abuse. We reaffirm our commitment made in the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction and in the measures to enhance international cooperation, which we adopted during the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the drugs problem last June. The fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the fifth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action will be important milestones providing an opportunity for us to think about the progress made and the effective enjoyment of fundamental freedoms. They also provide an opportunity for every State to renew its commitment to comply with the obligations it has entered into, as part of the international legal machinery that protects and promotes these rights. El Salvador reaffirms its support for the restoration of the rights of the Republic of China on Taiwan as a State Member of this Organization because we believe it is a matter of justice to respect the sovereign will and aspirations of its people in accordance with the principle of universality enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The changes that have occurred in the international arena since the end of the cold war have not narrowed the gap between the developed and developing countries — rather, the gap has become wider. The globalization, liberalization and interdependence that characterize the new international order are challenges and opportunities of which many of our countries cannot take proper advantage because of the constraints we face. Integrating into the competitive world requires resources, technology and financing that go well beyond the national capacities of the least developed countries. This situation can be overcome only with the participation of the countries that are better developed. In his report on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General said again that the volume of external assistance to the developing countries has declined steadily during the current decade, and much of what is given is not appropriate for or aimed at the needs of the recipient countries. El Salvador urges donor countries to try to increase their cooperation for development, and particularly urges the industrialized countries to facilitate access to their markets for products from less developed countries. The great advances made in recent times in all areas of human knowledge highlight the need to make more of an effort to resolve the basic problems facing the majority of the world?s population. If we truly wish to have a world free from poverty, war, drugs, crime, terrorism and environmental degradation, we must join forces so that together we can find new mechanisms and new paths of action that lead us to a swift solution to the problems and concerns of our peoples. We appeal for the wisdom and help of the gods of the nations to ensure that in all corners of the earth peace, harmony, solidarity and progress will reign.  First of all, permit me to congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay, on his election to the post of President of the General Assembly. I would also like to address words of gratitude to Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko for the dynamic and competent manner in which he carried out his duties as President of the previous session of the General Assembly. We have very attentively studied the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization and have a very positive opinion of it. The quiet revolution begun by the Secretary-General one year ago — the institutional reform of the United Nations — has become an irreversible process tied to the rapidly changing conditions of our new era. One of the major problems confronting the community of nations is how to better understand emerging socio-economic forces and the modalities of globalization, and how to channel them towards the fulfilment of our requirements. Acting within the framework of the United Nations, Turkmenistan is expanding the scope of its responsibilities within the world community of nations. I have the honour to inform the Assembly that yesterday, here at United Nations Headquarters, Turkmenistan signed the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Furthermore, today, during my meeting with the Secretary-General, I handed him the instrument of Turkmenistan?s accession to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, signed by the President of Turkmenistan. Although we know that accession by several countries more is still lacking for the Convention?s entry into force, Turkmenistan by its example would like to call on other States Members of the Organization to join the Convention, adding their voices in its support — or rather in support of their citizens working for the United Nations. The Secretary-General?s proposal concerning real partnerships between the United Nations and multilateral regional organizations seems to be highly relevant, because regional organizations are especially effective in early warning and preventive diplomacy, as well as in finding optimal ways to carry out globalization. The proposal on the establishment of a special unit to combat crime, terrorism, drug and weapons trafficking and money-laundering is very timely. A recent wave of terrorist acts around the world, including the bombings in Tanzania and Kenya and the killing of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan, requires consolidation of efforts by the world community and decisive action. Turkmenistan resolutely fights against those negative phenomena and is prepared to contribute to the implementation of special United Nations programmes aimed at eradicating these evils. Turkmenistan welcomes the strengthening of the framework mechanism for interaction among all organizations of the United Nations system. I would like to take this opportunity to express on behalf of the Government of Turkmenistan our gratitude to the missions of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Children?s Fund (UNICEF), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other United Nations agencies, the positive results of whose work in Turkmenistan cannot be overestimated. Turkmenistan also expresses its gratitude to the donor countries supporting those programmes in our country. 28 We are gravely concerned about the continuing armed conflict in Afghanistan because it has a negative impact on the stability of the region and on its economic development. Its impact also bears on Turkmenistan, which has one of the longest borders with Afghanistan, stretching for nearly 1,000 kilometres. Turkmenistan shares the opinion that there is no alternative to a peaceful, negotiated settlement in that country and that violence gives birth to violence and will only lead the process to a dead end. That is why we in Turkmenistan believe that the road to peace in that long- suffering nation lies through political negotiations among all parties to the conflict under the auspices of the United Nations. Turkmenistan fully supports the efforts of the United Nations, its Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and his Special Envoy, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, and joint steps undertaken within the framework of the 6 + 2 mechanism. Turkmenistan?s President, Mr. Saparmurat Niyazov, maintains constant contacts regarding this matter with the Secretary-General and with the leaders of neighbouring States. Turkmenistan will continue to cooperate closely with the United Nations in this regard. Interaction among Afghanistan?s neighbouring countries, the United Nations, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and all the parties concerned should lead to the termination of one of the most protracted and violent conflicts of this century. In view of the global changes that are taking place in the sphere of international relations, Turkmenistan believes that development of the Central Asian region objectively deserves the attention of the world. The States of that region have opened to the world a huge geopolitical and geoeconomic potential, enormous natural wealth, and geographical and transport opportunities. Turkmenistan is vigorously seeking alternative routes for delivery of its energy resources to international markets. In developing a strategy for the implementation of pipeline construction projects, we have proceeded and continue to proceed on the basis of various options. Pipeline infrastructure based on a variety of options will ensure an increased volume and greater diversification of energy deliveries, and will enable us to stabilize and guarantee their international distribution. There is one more issue that I would like to dwell upon in this context. It concerns inter-State pipeline routes. The problem of international pipeline routes can well be compared to that of international sea straits, which was one of the most complex political and diplomatic challenges at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Today such straits ensure freedom of navigation, including for landlocked States. Their international legal recognition is called for by the economic and political interests of the world community in developing mutual relations. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, adopted in 1982, reaffirmed the importance of maintaining freedom of navigation through straits and passages in archipelago waters and the need to do so. Freedom of navigation, which existed in the past as an international custom, was legally codified as one of the most important principles of international law. In this context, of great interest are modern problems relating to the transportation of energy resources to international markets. It so happens that these enormous resources are located far away from the world markets. Usually it is landlocked nations that possess such resources, and the choice of delivery routes and the location of transnational pipelines has turned into a major problem of our times. The resolution of this problem lies at the centre of the geopolitical and geoeconomic interests of the States that own the resources, the transit States and the consumer countries. In this respect, Turkmenistan promotes the initiative of security guarantees and unimpeded transit of energy resources along international pipelines. This initiative has already been discussed with a number of State leaders, as well as with the United Nations Secretary-General. We advocate the establishment of an international legal mechanism designed to protect the interests of the producers, transit countries and the consumers. It is necessary to fully preclude the possibility of pipelines being used as a means of political pressure and economic domination. The process of globalization in international economic relations calls for the elaboration of an international convention that will govern the regime of inter-State pipelines and guarantee their functioning. Turkmenistan regards this matter as one of the most important challenges of the coming twenty-first century and is prepared to sponsor a document on this matter in the United Nations. A change in the geopolitical situation has brought about a new correlation of interests in the Caspian Sea region, thus making it necessary to elaborate new approaches for the determination of the status of the Caspian Sea. The uncertainty that exists today with respect to this issue hampers rational use of the enormous potential of the Sea by the littoral States. A majority of the Caspian Sea States today favour the option of dividing the Caspian Sea into different sectors. Turkmenistan also supports this approach, just as it had previously supported the concept of condominium. 29 What is most important to us under either of the two approaches is that the interests of all littoral States should be fully taken into consideration and that cooperation in the Caspian Sea region should be built on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit. The Caspian Sea should be a sea of accord, and its wealth should be a common heritage of all littoral States, with each of them having a right to a corresponding national share of the sea. Turkmenistan believes that the search for a new legal status of the Caspian Sea, which would require all littoral States to look for reasonable compromises and display readiness to have an appropriate perception of new realities, should be ensured by means of monitoring by the United Nations. Today the process of establishing a new international legal status of the Caspian Sea confronts a number of difficulties fraught with very negative consequences for regional stability. Under these conditions we consider that United Nations involvement would be highly appropriate. We are happy to see that today there is a growing tendency towards restraint with respect to the attempts aimed at associating extremism and other negative phenomena with the world of Islam. The Muslim world is multifaceted and diverse. It faces a great range of universal and global problems of development. In this context, there emerges an objective need for mutual understanding and dialogue among various religious trends, a need for restraint and tolerance. The President of the United States, the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Prime Minister of Turkey and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Germany and Russia have expressed very wise and politically promising ideas and statements during the current session. In this respect, we find of great interest the idea voiced by the President of Iran, Mr. Khatami, on declaring the year 2001 the year of dialogue between civilizations. The point is that the resolution of today?s global challenges is inconceivable without a meaningful dialogue, an exchange of opinions and a search for ways to resolve the most pressing problems. It is already three years since Turkmenistan began pursuing its policy as a State of permanent neutrality. Turkmenistan?s neutrality is not a shell that protects it from dangers and tribulations of the outside world. On the contrary, it is a position of strength that allows us to actively influence the situation in our region and the world as a whole and to develop effective international cooperation. We seek to maintain equal and equitable relations with all nations, and our national interests are pursued through economic openness and political impartiality. Proceeding from this position, Turkmenistan attaches great importance to the United Nations role as a unique international institution in which all countries of our planet have equal access to international debate and the resolution of problems that concern them. Turkmenistan believes that on the eve of the twenty- first century the United Nations should acquire additional powers and responsibilities, and strengthen its current ones, by becoming a major factor in establishing a climate of mutual respect and trust both in separate regions and the world as a whole. In conclusion, I would like to recall a proposal made by the Secretary-General regarding the holding of the General Assembly session in the year 2000 in the form of the Millennium Assembly. That Assembly would give all the Member States of the United Nations a unique opportunity to take a look into the future, to ponder how they perceive the United Nations of today and to speculate on what kind of United Nations they will support in the next century.  It is my privilege and honour to address the fifty-third session of the General Assembly on behalf of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 12 At the outset I would like to congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti on his election as President. His well-known skills and experience in international affairs guarantee the wise conduct of this session. Our gratitude goes to the outgoing President, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine. Just a few days ago the outcome of the recent general elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina was made public. We are satisfied with the fact that those important elections, conducted under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), passed practically without incident or disruption. According to the general assessment by the international and local monitors, we had free and fair elections. A new chapter in the political life of Bosnia and Herzegovina is about to begin. The new Parliament and the new Council of Ministers will have to address without delay a number of issues of vital importance for our country. Indeed, at stake is the destiny of a country with a particular internal structure: three constitutive peoples, two entities and one internationally recognized State. Only through scrupulous respect for equal rights and adequate participation in power by the parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina can we achieve the goal, which has no credible alternative: a modern State based on the rule of law, parliamentary democracy, respect for human rights and a market economy. This will also open the door for integration into European and transatlantic institutions. The most encouraging sign in this direction was the recent Declaration of support by the European Union and the establishment of its Joint Task Force with Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is obvious that we in Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot do this alone. We must prove to our friends and supporters from around the world that we can be a reliable, responsible partner in this joint project, which in the end should place Bosnia and Herzegovina in the family of democratic States. But it also must be remembered that, inevitably, those in Bosnia and Herzegovina who behave differently or against the rules will not be allowed to participate in this endeavour of crucial importance. The question about the future of my country is being asked in many quarters of the world. The same question, but certainly with an additional existential and emotional charge, is in the air in Bosnia and Herzegovina itself. There are no easy answers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, since we are talking here about the future of a very specific country, the possible answer is at the same time both simple and complicated. It is simple because of the fact that whoever holds public office in Bosnia and Herzegovina is obliged to implement the provisions of the Dayton Agreement fully and unconditionally. On the other hand, it is complicated because it will, to a large extent, depend on good political will, a sense of historical responsibility and the determination of each player in the complex State structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina to do so. Almost three years after the signing of the Peace Agreement, the consolidation of peace and the reconstruction process in Bosnia and Herzegovina is entering a new stage. From the very beginning, the military component was implemented well and an environment of overall security was created. Thus, we were able to focus our energy on the civilian aspects of the Agreement, which proved to be extremely complex. We went through the rough waters of various obstacles, mistrust, misunderstanding and obstruction. But it was also a time of the first signs of confidence-building and the establishment of the necessary foundation for a healthy partnership. In spite of the often justified criticism regarding the pace of progress, one must recall some of the important positive steps that have been made: one flag, a common currency, common license plates, common passports, generally improved freedom of movement and significant reconstruction results. On the other hand, the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes of origin, the proper functioning of State institutions, an independent judicial system, and the uniform protection of human rights still represent major problems in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Therefore, with the elections behind us, the renewed political resolve and energy must be applied to finding a solution to all the aforementioned issues. A multi-ethnic, multicultural Bosnia and Herzegovina within both its entities, in which mutual respect, equality and cooperation among the constitutive peoples and different ethnic groups are shared assets, will be the best answer to superficial theories on the inevitable clashes between different cultures and civilizations. The continued presence of the international community in Bosnia and Herzegovina is certainly needed. Without the generous help and support it has 13 extended so far, little would have been achieved. The United Nations and its specialized agencies stand high among those that are doing their best to help Bosnia and Herzegovina overcome its problems. But the time has come to consider that one future path may lie in changing the donor-recipient relationship into a concrete, project-oriented joint venture, in which local companies and infrastructure could have a more substantial participation. This would no doubt contribute to the faster economic rehabilitation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and to reaching the level of self-sustainable growth. Better economic prospects will certainly enhance our ability to overcome many existing obstacles and to achieve the overall stability of the country; and the ultimate goal of handing over the business of running the country to the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina would be better served. At a more global level, this is the way for Bosnia and Herzegovina to become a factor for stability in the region and an active partner in building security architecture on the continent. As has already been mentioned, we in Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot do this alone. But, hand in hand with the international community, we can all continue our journey into the next millennium with more hope and better prospects. In less than two years, the century — full of achievements and unbelievable technological progress, but also a period of two world wars and a number of smaller but no less tragic conflicts — will be over. We are stepping into a new millennium with a lot of expectations, but also with heavy baggage. Here, I would be morally and politically reckless if I did not highlight the tragic and increasingly alarming situation in the Kosovo region of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Events there certainly have a contaminating effect on Bosnia and Herzegovina, at least psychologically. However, the situation is in itself worthy of our great consideration and engagement, regardless of its impact on Bosnia and Herzegovina or beyond. Lessons must have been learned from the international treatment Bosnia and Herzegovina received during our recent crisis. Decisiveness, urgency and the proper combination of tools and remedies available to the key factors must all be there in order for us to achieve a speedy and proper solution. The human, national and democratic rights of all the parties must be taken into consideration, as must the territorial integrity of all States in the region. No matter how we get there, all lasting solutions end with a political settlement — one which all the parties need to abide by, if not always enthusiastically support. We are there to help in any way we can and the active support of us all will be necessary. Bosnia and Herzegovina, on the other hand, has tried to learn from its recent past. When you have to pay a high price for a lesson, you also learn well. Among other steps, Bosnia and Herzegovina has ratified the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. We now need to continue our efforts to decontaminate the ground, and the assistance of the international community is also essential in this endeavour. Bosnia and Herzegovina’s experience was also critical to the recent adoption of the Statute of the International Criminal Court in Rome. We played a vital and active role in Rome, since we are convinced that justice and reconciliation, legality and peace, are intertwined. The new Court should take into consideration the experiences of the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, whose impact on lasting peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina is critical. We in Bosnia and Herzegovina are convinced that those responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law should be brought to justice, regardless of the ethnicity of the victims or perpetrators. We have a direct and decisive interest in securing compliance by all signatories, and all others who are obligated, with all their commitments under the peace Agreement, including full compliance with the International Tribunal. One thing we can be proud of is our universal Organization, the United Nations, which, throughout this time, has been the main vehicle for promoting peace, cooperation and development on our planet. In the face of new challenges, we would like to see the United Nations even more efficient and instrumental in dealing with a number of global issues. The struggle against terrorism, illegal arms and drug- trafficking and violations of human rights is in the forefront of our common agenda for a better future. The role of a dynamic, effective, well-focused United Nations is indispensable in that respect. This year, we are also celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Thanks to that document and to the tireless 14 activities of people around the world, human rights have become a genuine global issue, and ensuring their respect and protection is one of the most important ongoing tasks of the international community. The end of this millennium in human history has witnessed a growing number of massive humanitarian emergencies. We need to draw conclusions from them because the flagrant violation of human rights and humanitarian law and the barbaric acts of savagery that we have witnessed in various parts of the globe in recent years are an affront to our common humanity. Based on our own experience in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we have learned lessons that we must share with the international community as a part of our humanitarian duty. We owe it to ourselves and to our children. That is why my Government intends to propose for the favourable consideration of this Assembly a set of basic tenets of humanitarian action in emergency situations. The purpose is neither to duplicate nor to downgrade the ongoing efforts, but rather to supplement what exists and to enhance awareness of the need to adjust international norms and practices to new realities. We trust that all Member States will join us in this effort so that, together, we are able to contribute to the development of a new international humanitarian order.   At the outset, I wish to convey the apologies of President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, who was supposed to address the Assembly. He is unable to come to New York because of other pressing State duties. Allow me, on behalf of my delegation, to convey our warm congratulations to you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. Let me pay a special tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for the excellent manner in which he presided over the work of the fifty- second session of the General Assembly. I wish also to thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for all the endeavours he is undertaking in shaping our Organization to enable it to effectively meet the challenges of the next millennium. The United Nations has been at the forefront of efforts to tackle problems of international peace and security and social and economic development. It has helped many communities around the world attain peace, greater security and higher standards of living. Africa faces a number of challenges which must be urgently addressed. It is a volatile region in which a multiplicity of conflicts have combined to create a very explosive atmosphere. Refugee populations have multiplied to provide a further recipe for future instability. The situation has been further complicated by large numbers of internally displaced people. Indeed, a large political and humanitarian tragedy is taking place in the region. There is therefore an urgent need for the international community to support Africa?s efforts to address the fundamental causes of the conflict. It has been alleged that ethnic differences are the prime causes of conflict in the region. My delegation does not share this view. We believe that poor leadership, poverty and low levels of economic development in the region are the main underlying causes. The leadership in our region must correctly define and analyse the root causes of the problems and establish clear priorities. It is also imperative that, for a permanent and durable peace to prevail in the region, a comprehensive programme of economic recovery and development be implemented in Africa. Concerted efforts must therefore be made to reduce and ultimately eradicate poverty in the world. In this regard, Uganda had the honour of hosting a leaders? forum in Kampala in January this year at which the heads of State and Government of countries in the eastern, southern and central regions of Africa met and held discussions with the President of the World Bank. That meeting, which in many ways was unique and inspiring, opened a new chapter in Africa?s relations with 18 the Bank. It ushered in a genuine spirit of partnership between Africa and the Bank. Two of the significant outcomes of the meeting were, first, the decision that Africa would be considered a priority development region by the World Bank and, secondly, a commitment to depoliticize foreign aid. It was also agreed at the meeting that African countries must set their own priorities for development. It is the hope of my delegation that the agreements reached at the Kampala leaders? forum will be translated into concrete action by the international community in the near future. We believe that similar initiatives could be undertaken together with other organs of the United Nations system. For too long, international efforts have been expended on short-term humanitarian programmes, ignoring the long- term requirements for sustainable peace and development. Past experience has shown that this approach cannot ensure durable peace and development. Indeed, as the Secretary- General noted in his report on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa, “Preventing such wars is no longer a matter of defending States or protecting allies. It is a matter of defending humanity”. (A/52/871, para. 3) Conflict prevention, including post-conflict peace- building, requires a sustained effort to infuse funds into the region. In this regard, we urge serious consideration and expeditious implementation of the recommendations contained in the Secretary-General?s report. The massive cuts in social spending and public investments, with the attendant high levels of unemployment, create new centres of discontent and thus further fuel the embers of conflict. Attempts to impose conditionalities which are antithetical to the peace process and the cutting off of aid from weak Governments making sincere efforts to pursue reconciliation or implement peace agreements have been counterproductive. My delegation would wish to argue for “peace-friendly” structural adjustment programmes, if durable peace and sustainable development are to be achieved in Africa and elsewhere. A number of delegations have expressed their views on the situation in the Great Lakes region with specific reference to the ongoing crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. My country was specifically accused of involvement in the crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The facts of the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are not clear to some member States of this Assembly. Since, many speakers have raised this issue, we would like to make the following clarifications. Uganda?s interest in the situation in the Great Lakes region has always been and is still based on the following: the need to ensure total security in all parts of Uganda and the protection of the lives and property of the people of Uganda; and the desire to ensure maximum stability in the Great Lakes region, because instability in any neighbouring country directly affects our security and economy. These concerns are legitimate. Our position on this crisis therefore reflects our efforts to pursue those interests. Before the fall of former President Mobutu, it was not possible for Uganda to get cooperation from the then Government in Zaire to ensure that Zairian territory was not used by terrorist organizations to create insecurity along the Uganda-Zaire border and inside Uganda. When President Laurent Kabila came to power it was mutually agreed between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo that our two armies would jointly operate in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to contain and eventually remove the bandits who were using the bases they had in the area to destabilize Uganda. Pursuant to that understanding, Uganda has since maintained a military presence in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in accordance with the provision of the bilateral agreement between our two countries. The situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo today necessitates that Uganda must maintain that military presence, which is crucial for the security of our country and our people. Let me make it clear to all and sundry that Uganda has no territorial designs on the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is not the primary responsibility of Uganda to dictate the political arrangements of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, any internal arrangement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo which does not take into account the legitimate security concerns of its neighbours is our concern. We would like to say that unilateral military intervention by individual countries or sectional intervention by groups of countries is unacceptable. These actions are likely to escalate the problem. If there are good reasons for an intervention, it should be regional, carried out, for example, through the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the Organization of African Unity (OAU) or 19 even the United Nations, and in the context of the peace initiatives that are already in place. We would therefore like to stress that there are serious regional efforts to address the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We believe these efforts should be supported by the entire membership of this Organization and by all parties that are interested in the conflict and have a vested interest in peace and security in the Great Lakes region. Uganda?s commitment to the full respect for and universal enjoyment of human rights is well known. However, we regret that crimes are now being committed on a daily basis against the people of Uganda by surrogate forces of the so-called Lord?s Resistance Army (LRA) with the full knowledge and assistance of their sponsors, who do not believe in freedom and respect for human rights. Innocent children are abducted daily, subjected to forced labour and military service and made victims of other, similar crimes, with the support of the sponsors of these terrorist groups. The world awoke to this horrendous crime at the fifty-fourth session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, when it adopted draft resolution E/CN.4/1998/L.40, which calls upon the LRA and its sponsors to release all the abducted children immediately and unconditionally. My delegation believes that without external support the Lord?s Resistance Army would not be in a position to commit these atrocities and defy international public opinion on this extremely important matter. We call upon the international community to intensify pressure on the countries involved to stop backing these terrorists. On the other hand, we wish to thank the United Nations bodies, non-governmental organizations and all others who have been involved in seeking the freedom of these children. We hope their efforts will not be in vain. The United Nations is a vibrant institution for many reasons, among them its unwavering support for actions aimed at advancing freedom, peace and security. Today, terrorism poses a serious threat to these values. Individuals and organizations whose stock in trade is the violation of these values roam the globe with impunity. Recent attacks in East Africa came at a time when we thought the world had learned the futility of such senseless, wanton murder and destruction. It is the firm belief of my delegation that the international community should collectively take action to deny sanctuary to these savages. Countries known to harbour such elements should be isolated and punished severely so that human freedom can be protected. My delegation further believes that this is an opportune moment to convene an international conference on terrorism which must map out strategies to deal with this escalating problem. Last year the world had only five declared nuclear States; today we have seven; next year we may have more. In essence, such non-proliferation agreements as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) have not deterred the emergence of new nuclear States. The philosophy of dependence on nuclear weapons for security is, in a creeping and disturbing fashion, becoming universal. This situation is creating new dangers for the survival of mankind. My delegation believes that a new universal security doctrine needs to evolve. All nuclear weapons should be eliminated. In line with this belief, my delegation calls for the adoption of an action plan for the elimination of all nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework. Such an approach should be universal, and not regional or discriminatory, if it is to achieve the desired goals. Since the last session of the General Assembly, several developments have taken place in the international arena, some of which have offered hope and encouragement, while others have led to destruction and despair. The issue of Western Sahara is of concern to my delegation. We are concerned by the slow progress towards the holding of a United Nations-supervised referendum on the self-determination of the people of that territory. We appeal to the parties to overcome their differences and allow a just and impartial referendum to take place. On the Lockerbie incident, Uganda welcomes the initial moves taken in a bid to solve the problem between the United States of America and the United Kingdom on the one hand and Libya on the other. We encourage the Secretary-General to work out comprehensive and clear arrangements, acceptable to all concerned parties, so that the matter can finally be resolved. Today we live in a globalized world. Globalization has created new opportunities as well as grave risks and challenges. Its impact has strengthened the developed countries and weakened the developing countries. Such a situation does not augur well for international peace and 20 security. There is an urgent need for deliberate policies to reorient international trade and finance. The crisis in South- East Asia should serve as a warning to the world of the catastrophe that inaction will breed. The ever widening gap between the developed and the developing countries and among countries in the South could also become a source of future instability. There should be no delay in addressing these problems. My delegation calls upon the developed countries to honour their obligations and increase the transfer of resources to the developing countries for the transformation of their economies, so that they may become equal partners in the global economy. In the recent past, despite drastic limitations in both human and financial resources, the United Nations has responded admirably to the challenges of the era, including peacekeeping, emergency operations and development. It has a commendable record which should serve to strengthen our confidence in the Organization. As we inch our way into the twenty-first century, we should translate this confidence into the necessary political will to strengthen the Organization. We should demonstrate our faith and dedication to the United Nations and its component parts by providing it with the resources necessary to fulfil its immense mandate. Our challenge is to bequeath to succeeding generations a strong United Nations, able to guarantee the principles enshrined in the preamble of its Charter. I have the honour and privilege to speak on behalf of the European Union. In this capacity I would like to extend my warm and sincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. We are pleased that a distinguished Latin American statesman chairs our deliberations. I am confident that your experience, talent and energy will ensure a successful outcome for the work of our session. I wish to express the high appreciation of the European Union for the outstanding leadership of the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, and for his excellent work at the helm of the United Nations. His â€œquiet revolutionâ€ of institutional reforms has our full support. We are looking forward to working with him to prepare the Millennium Assembly in the year 2000 in order to meet the challenges of human solidarity. At the turn of the century, we live in a fascinating and challenging, but also difficult and complex, period of time, characterized by uncertainty and unpredictability. Local wars and ethnic conflicts have continued and new ones have broken out. â€œPeace processesâ€ have had rather mixed success, and some show a distressing tendency to unravel. The threat from weapons of mass destruction is as alarming as ever. A majority of the Earthâs population still lives in poverty. Enormous environmental disasters hit our planet all too often, and organized crime, illicit drug trafficking and terrorism are the plague of our time. Financial and economic crises of unprecedented dimensions do not spare any region â€” Asia and Russia being the most recent examples. The impact of these phenomena is felt directly and immediately by every citizen in the world. Economies are more intertwined than ever, and information travels around the globe within seconds. No one can escape the forces of globalization, but all of us can join not only in confronting transnational threats but also in collecting the fruits of globalization. The United Nations has a key part to play in this collective effort. Only our universal organization has the scope and legitimacy to generate the principles, norms and rules that are essential to harness the potential of globalization while managing its negative effects. 7 Todayâs turmoil in the financial markets can be dealt with only at a global level, addressing the political causes as well as the financial and economic aspects. It is imperative that industrial and developing countries elaborate a common strategy in a framework of international financial cooperation, including the G-22, and formulate standards and rules for financial transactions. What is needed now is leadership. Short-term remedies are not enough; long-term forward looking policies are required. We must invest in both sustainable growth and solidarity. As serious as the crisis is, there is every reason not to panic. The world economy is basically sound, with two thirds â€” 70 per cent â€” of the worldâs population living in growth zones. We sometimes forget that. The European model of social market economy has served well to harness the forces of globalization. Respecting the interests and wishes of the people, showing solidarity for the poor and disadvantaged, promoting social partnership between employers and employees and combating unemployment by creating jobs and so on are intrinsic elements of a social market economy. We believe that this European model of a social market economy deserves serious consideration in our turbulent and complex age. To be honest, this is a kind of third way some are looking for. Europeâs answer to the challenges of globalization is two millennium projects which will shape the face of our continent: the introduction of the euro and the enlargement of the Union. The single currency will improve the functioning of the internal market, help to secure employment and provide incentives for the market-oriented structural reforms needed to safeguard Europeâs competitiveness. The creation of the euro has the potential to stabilize the international economic environment and to promote international trade. From the perspective of the world economy, this will be the most important effect of the single currency. Markets have already anticipated the introduction of the euro, as borne out by the monetary stability of the participating currencies, at a time when other countries and regions are experiencing severe financial crises. Consequently, the euro is creating a zone of stability and prosperity which will benefit the entire world economy. The second millennium project, which has far-reaching consequences, is the enlargement of the European Union. We are convinced that the integration of our neighbours is the best way to safeguard lasting political stability and economic progress in Europe. Successful enlargement will bring a new dynamic to the Union and strengthen its role to the benefit of all the citizens of both Europe and the world. The process of enlarging the Union does not mean that the Union will become more inward-oriented or Eurocentric. On the contrary, we are convinced that the Union must continue to be outward- and forward-looking. Enlarging the European Union will go hand-in-hand with developing our traditional relations with countries and exporting stability around the world. As President of the Council of the European Union, I would like to assure Members of the United Nations that an enlarged Union with a strong common currency will be a reliable and strong partner for the United Nations and the world. I would like to stress the paramount interest of the European Union in the political and economic stability of Russia. We hope that the new Government of Russia will be able to re-establish confidence among the Russian people and the international financial community. We stand ready to cooperate further with the Russian authorities in support of sustained efforts towards stabilization and reform. Let me now draw attention to a subject to which I attach the highest priority: the protection of the most vulnerable group in societies, our children. I am deeply convinced that a far-sighted policy, both internal and external, should be geared to the well-being of future generations. We, the statesmen, diplomats and decision makers of 185 nations, meeting in this Assembly, bear an enormous responsibility to formulate future-oriented policies in the service of young citizens on our planet. These include a fundamental principle. Our children must live childhood in peace, freedom, prosperity and security, free of abuse, violence and exploitation. Millions of children and juveniles are exploited worldwide, their basic human rights denied in many ways. A global coalition must be forged to fight the abuse of children, in particular sexual exploitation, the despicable phenomenon of child soldiers and child labour. The European Union supports the International Labour Organization draft convention on child labour. The involvement of children in armed conflict and its disastrous consequences require particular attention and action by the international community. I call upon all States and parties to conflicts to respect existing international standards, to stop the use of children as combatants and to fully support the work of the Secretary-Generalâs Special Representative for Children in Armed Conflict, Olara Otunnu. 8 Sexual exploitation of children is one of the most abhorrent phenomena of our time. The European Union puts special emphasis on combating child prostitution and child pornography. This includes the spread of child pornography on the Internet. New information technologies create new challenges. But that is why, more than ever, we have to prohibit the production, dissemination and possession of child pornography in all its forms â€” print, audio, electronic media and video. Many countries have already enacted such legislation nationally. But only a worldwide ban on child pornography will be effective. In this context, we hope that the optional protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography can be finalized in the near future. Legislative action has to be complemented by improved cooperation between national and international law enforcement and judicial authorities. I appeal to Governments, the United Nations, non-governmental organizations and private business â€” including online services and Internet service providers â€” to join efforts in a crusade against child abuse. For every day we fail to do so, the innocent children of our world pay a terrible price. Human rights, good and democratic governance and the rule of law have moved to centre stage in promoting peace, security and sustainable development. Respect for and promotion of human rights have become a crucial component of Union policies. They play a significant role in contractual relations with third countries, in development cooperation and in the common foreign and security policy. The fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the five-year implementation review of the Vienna Declaration should provide an opportunity for a critical assessment of the progress made by all States. The Council of the European Union, in commemorating this anniversary on 10 December this year in Vienna, will send a strong signal to further strengthen the United Nations human rights programme, in particular the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The European Union will continue to work towards the full integration of human rights, as well as a gender perspective, into all activities of the United Nations system. We hope that the adoption of the human rights defenders declaration will send a strong message of support to human rights activists worldwide. The European Union welcomes the progress on a draft protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and a draft protocol to the Convention against Torture. We hope that the respective Working Groups can complete their work next year. I would like to stress our strong interest in cooperating with other Governments and civil society to improve the human rights situation in all parts of the world. To this end, the Union supports a wide range of projects and programmes in the field of human rights, the rule of law and electoral assistance. We will also work for the complete abolition of the death penalty. In the meantime, we shall call for a moratorium on all executions worldwide. The international community is confronted with an increasing number of new and more diverse forms of conflict, which often turn violent. Apart from taking measures of operational prevention, which address the consequences of conflicts and range from preventive diplomacy to all forms of peaceful settlement of disputes and the preventive deployment of forces, we have to concentrate on the root causes, such as disrespect for minorities. We therefore need a pro-active policy, focusing on preventing the outbreak of violence at an early stage. Early warning is a key element of a comprehensive strategy of conflict prevention and a prerequisite for any further action. Finally, post-conflict rehabilitation has to be more comprehensive and coordinated to address the wider issues of humanitarian assistance, reconstruction and respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law. The European Union firmly supports United Nations efforts to strengthen its conflict-prevention and crisis- management capacity. We are deeply committed to the primary role of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security and to the core functions of United Nations peacekeeping operations. This strong support is reflected in the facts: 4,500 troops and policemen from European Union countries serve in United Nations peacekeeping operations, which is one third of United Nations peacekeeping personnel; thousands more men and women from the European Union have served and are serving in United Nations-mandated operations such as the Stabilization Force in Bosnia; and our financial contribution represents almost 40 per cent of the United Nations peacekeeping budget. We welcome the increasingly multidimensional nature of peacekeeping operations, which poses new challenges to the average peacekeeper in the field. Peacekeeping today encompasses not only military tasks but a variety of other functions, such as civilian police activities, humanitarian assistance, demining, disarmament measures, demobilization, reintegration of former soldiers, 9 enhancing and monitoring respect for human rights and, last but not least, public information. At United Nations Headquarters, this requires a strong Department of Peacekeeping Operations which is able to fulfil its functions effectively. In the wake of the decision by the General Assembly to reduce progressively the number of posts filled by personnel on loan, we strongly underline that the Departmentâs expertise and gains of recent years must be retained. The European Union is gravely concerned about the increasing security threat to United Nations personnel in the field, not least to unarmed military observers and civilian personnel. Bearing in mind the responsibility of the United Nations and Member States towards those participating in United Nations peacekeeping operations, we wish to recall the obligation of host countries and parties to conflicts to ensure the safety of these operations. I would like to express our admiration and gratitude to all the men and women who serve under the banner of the United Nations in peace operations around the globe. They show remarkable courage, motivation and idealism. Likewise, I wish to express my deep sympathy to the families of United Nations personnel who have lost their lives in the service of peace. The European Union attaches the utmost importance to progress in the areas of disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation as a key element in the maintenance of peace and the strengthening of security. In this respect, the Union wishes to reiterate its deep concern about the grave threat to international peace and security posed by the nuclear tests carried out by India and Pakistan in May this year. The Union has called on both countries to adhere to international non-proliferation regimes, in particular by signing the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as it stands. The Union strongly urges India and Pakistan to refrain from nuclear tests and from the development or deployment of nuclear weapons and nuclear-capable missiles. Likewise, we call on both countries to engage in a substantive dialogue with each other and to agree on confidence-building measures. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime and the essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament. We are committed to the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and welcome the recent ratifications by several countries. We call upon all States which have not yet done so to accede to it, without any change. The conclusion of a fissile material cut-off treaty will constitute a significant contribution to non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. We warmly welcome the fact that all impediments to starting such negotiations finally have been overcome, and we are looking forward to contributing to the substantive negotiations. We continue to believe that the systematic and progressive efforts by nuclear-weapon States to reduce nuclear weapons need to be intensified and pursued with determination. Biological weapons pose grave dangers. It is shocking that they can also be produced by non-State actors. Therefore, the European Union gives priority to strengthening the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. We strive for the successful conclusion of the negotiations on a legally binding protocol establishing a verification and compliance regime in 1999. I would also like to underline our commitment to the universality and the full and effective implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, a landmark in the disarmament process. The European Union reaffirms its commitment to the goal of totally eliminating anti-personnel landmines worldwide and welcomes the opening for signature of the Ottawa Convention. We are pleased that the number of signatories and ratifications is rising steadily and that the Convention will enter into force on 1 March 1999. The fact that the required number of 40 ratifications was reached so quickly underlines the importance that the international community attaches to this endeavour. The European Union, being the major donor to anti-mine activities, is contributing significantly to solving the problems caused by those weapons. A serious challenge to the international community is raised by the combination of internal conflicts and the proliferation of small arms. This issue requires a multi- pronged response. The Union, for its part, has adopted a code of conduct on arms exports and has thereby set high common standards. Moreover, we are currently engaged in the implementation of the European Union programme for preventing and combating illicit trafficking in conventional arms. Under this programme, we will assist third countries in preventing and combating illicit trafficking in arms, and we will also assist affected countries. As we approach the new millennium, nearly a quarter of the worldâs people â€” foremost among them women and children â€” continue to live in absolute poverty, while almost a third more are very poor. While the blight of poverty thus continues to challenge the international community, recent decades have also shown 10 that progress in the reduction of poverty is possible. The goal of poverty eradication, through sustained growth and economic and social development, must be placed at the centre of international development cooperation. Poverty has many dimensions and needs to be tackled in a gender-sensitive and comprehensive way within the context of sustainable development, based on the interdependence and mutually reinforcing nature of economic development, social development and environmental protection. The European Union therefore attaches great importance to an integrated and coordinated follow-up to global conferences. While the first responsibility lies with Governments, the United Nations system, as the global framework for international cooperation, has a key role to play in supporting and coordinating national efforts. A new global partnership between developing countries, developed countries, multilateral institutions and civil society, with emphasis put on local ownership and complementarity of efforts, must be forged in order to achieve people-centred sustainable development. The strong commitment of the Union to such a global partnership is based on its unique position as the worldâs largest provider of development assistance. Among the various frameworks, the present LomÃ© Convention, which will expire in February 2000, remains essential. During the upcoming negotiations on a successor, the European Union will aim at strengthening its partnership with the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. Building on the experience gained so far, the aim is to develop a modern and efficient framework for cooperation in order to keep the relationship between the Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries strong and prominent in the twenty-first century. I am convinced that cooperation in the context of the LomÃ© Convention will make an effective contribution to eradicating poverty and integrating the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries into our worldwide economic system. We are committed to sustainable development as the overarching principle of national policy and international cooperation in our policies. Recognizing the central role of a healthy environment in quality of life, the European Union attaches great importance to reform of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (HABITAT). We would welcome more coordination, focus and efficiency in these areas. The Kyoto Protocol, in which the member States of the European Union committed themselves to a reduction of 8 per cent in greenhouse gases, constitutes an important step towards sustainable development. As developed countries, we are prepared to take the lead in combating climate change. The European Community and its member States are determined to translate the commitments made at Kyoto into concrete actions and achievements. In the context of sustainable development, population issues are of particular concern. They directly relate to human health and the quality of life. Over the coming decades, population size and age structure will be important factors interacting with economic development and the environment in all parts of the world. It is therefore very timely that a special session of the General Assembly will be convened next year to review and appraise the implementation of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, held in Cairo in 1994. The fight against drugs is a major priority in the policy of the European Union. The recent special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem was an important step in the international effort to counter the global scourge of drug abuse. I should like to pay tribute to the Executive Director of the United Nations Drug Control Programme (UNDCP), Pino Arlacchi, and all others involved, for the excellent preparation of the session. Political leaders unanimously endorsed a series of important documents, including a Political Declaration, several action plans, time-frames and a number of concrete measures. We welcome the balanced, integrated and gender- sensitive anti-drug strategy adopted by the special session. Our new commitments embrace efforts on both the supply and the demand side, constituting equal parameters of the drug-control equation. In particular, we look forward to the elaboration of an operational action programme on demand reduction. We from the European Union fully support an effective and rapid follow-up and implementation programme of the outcome of the special session. In the light of the important new and extensive mandates in the field of international drug control, the donor base of UNDCP must be broadened. The European Union will continue to support the valuable work of UNDCP, the international lead agency in the follow-up to the special session. The fight against organized crime â€” and the work of the United Nations Centre for International Crime Prevention â€” is of foremost importance. In this context 11 we welcome closer cooperation between UNDCP and the Crime Prevention Centre in order to enhance the synergy of these programmes. The danger which transnational organized crime poses to the world community by creeping into many aspects of our societies must be met by effective international measures. Therefore, we support the elaboration of a convention against transnational organized crime and are pleased about the constructive and productive spirit of the preparatory meeting in Buenos Aires. The horrible bomb attacks in Africa and Northern Ireland have brought terrorism back to the forefront of international concern. The General Assembly, setting norms and standards for the fight against terrorism, has passed a number of resolutions and adopted no fewer than 11 anti- terrorism conventions. The Sixth Committee is currently negotiating a convention on the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism. Its early finalization would signal the determination of the international community to relentlessly pursue terrorists. Only through concerted action can we win the battle against terrorists. The more countries join in this effort, the fewer the safe havens where terrorists can run or hide. The successful completion of the Conference for the establishment of an International Criminal Court is an achievement of historic dimensions. The European Union fully endorses the outcome of the Rome Conference and the Statute, which was adopted by an overwhelming majority of participating States. This Statute lays the foundation for an effective and credible Court as an institution to fight impunity for the most heinous crimes and to deter, once and for all, their commission, thereby contributing to the global advancement of peace and democracy. This session of the General Assembly must adopt the appropriate decisions to make the Court a reality. The European Union stands ready to do its utmost to contribute to the accomplishment of these tasks. As in the past, the European Union describes its relations with third countries, and its position on areas of conflict throughout the world, in a memorandum that is circulated as an integral part of this address. The memorandum is a useful compendium of the common foreign and security policy of the Union and of relevant Community policies. I will highlight just a few positions. We are extremely concerned at the dramatic escalation of tension in Kosovo. Hundreds of people have been killed, more than 250,000 refugees have been forced to leave their homes as a result of armed clashes, and the threat of a humanitarian catastrophe is becoming ever more real. The primary responsibility for the devastating situation rests with the Serb and Yugoslav authorities, since their police and military operations have led to consequences for the civilian population that are out of any justifiable proportion. Therefore, it is up to President Slobodan Milosevic to order a halt to all repressive actions against the civilian population in Kosovo. At the same time, the Union expects that all parties concerned reject all forms of violence. The Union, together with humanitarian organizations, has started a series of projects in order to create favourable conditions for a return process for refugees before the winter comes. A complete cessation of armed activities and a progressive withdrawal of Serb forces is needed now to make people confident enough to return to their homes. The European Union urges the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia authorities to allow unimpeded access to all areas of Kosovo for humanitarian organizations and observers and international forensic experts. Negotiations between both sides, with international involvement, should take place as soon as possible to agree upon confidence-building measures and to define a new status for Kosovo. However, without a cessation of the ongoing Serb offensive, an end to further bloodshed and a significant improvement of the catastrophic humanitarian situation, a meaningful dialogue cannot be started. The European Union hopes that progress towards democracy, which is a prerequisite for the resolution of the conflict, can be achieved in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The final objective of the reform process should be the full integration of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into the international community. The Union remains fully committed to the implementation of the Dayton Accords, to political and economic stabilization, the return of refugees and the strengthening of civil society in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The past year has seen substantial progress due to strong pressure by the international community. We hope that the recent elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina will contribute to the reconciliation of the ethnic communities and to the construction of a new civil society. With regard to Albania, the European Union is seriously concerned at the recent outbreak of violence following the assassination of a leading politician of an opposition party. The European Union calls on all Albanian political parties to adopt a constructive attitude to solving the crisis by peaceful means through political consultations. It urges the parties to renounce any strategy of confrontation and to avoid fighting and violent 12 demonstrations. Further violence will make national reconciliation even more difficult. We sincerely hope that the instability still widespread in Albania will soon be overcome, in particular by overcoming the current political difficulties caused by hatred, mutual mistrust and various actions by both the Government and the main opposition party. The Union reminds all political factions of their obligation not to deepen the political divide, but rather to develop a spirit of cooperation. The Union will continue its assistance according to progress made in the political dialogue as well as in the stabilization of institutions, especially in the field of police action. The European Union stresses once again that the status quo in Cyprus is not acceptable. It reaffirms its strong support for the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative aimed at a negotiated and lasting solution to the Cyprus question, respecting the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity of the country in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions, with the goal of a bizonal, bicommunal federation on Cyprus. The Union started accession negotiations with the Republic of Cyprus on 31 March of this year. The accession process and progress towards a political solution should reinforce one another. Accession to the Union should benefit all communities and help to bring about peace and reconciliation on the island. In this context, we welcome the appointment of the new United Nations Deputy Special Representative, Dame Ann Hercus. The European Union remains deeply concerned at the continuing standstill in the Middle East peace process, which constitutes a threat to the stability of the region. The Union considers the Middle East peace process to be the only path to security and peace for Israel, the Palestinians and the neighbouring States. A just and durable solution is in the fundamental interest of the European Union. Our approach was reaffirmed at the meeting of the European Council held in Cardiff in June 1998. We contribute actively to efforts to promote the peace process, providing not only substantial economic support but also adding our political weight to the search for a solution. It is of the utmost importance to restore trust and confidence between the parties. The pillars of a solution continue to be in the principles agreed at Madrid and Oslo, especially land for peace, the full implementation of existing commitments of the Israeli/Palestinian Interim Agreement and the relevant Security Council resolutions. We call on Israel to recognize the right of the Palestinians to self-determination without excluding the option of a state of their own. On the other side, we call upon the Palestinians to reaffirm their commitment to Israelâs right to live within recognized and safe borders. We also reiterate our opposition to Israeli settlements in occupied Arab territories and to other unilateral measures, such as the changing of the status of Jerusalem. More than any other issues, such acts, as well as the continued expansion of settlements, undermine the Palestiniansâ confidence in the peace process. The European Union will continue to provide assistance to the Palestinian people. The positive development of the Palestinian economy is a precondition for political stability. We want to express our concern at the lack of progress on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, and we underline the need for a continuing effort in order to achieve a solution. The Union supports the efforts of the United States to relaunch the negotiations. We consider that every avenue should be explored in order to restore a spirit of mutual trust and constructive negotiations. In this respect, we think that the recent proposals put forward by France and Egypt, as well as by our European Union Special Envoy, should be studied positively. Africa, in particular sub-Saharan Africa, stands at the crossroads once more. In his landmark report (A/52/871) entitled â€œThe causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africaâ€, Secretary-General Kofi Annan provided us with a clear analysis and a framework for a comprehensive policy. The European Union is deeply concerned about the terrible toll that recent and current conflicts have taken, especially on innocent civilians. In spite of important regional and subregional efforts, the instability appears to be spreading, and creating a downward spiral that simply has to be stopped. I therefore urge the international community to continue to complement African efforts to solve their problems, as it has done by establishing the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA) and the United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL). The Union would welcome further development of regional and subregional 13 cooperation and integration among African countries. We hope that the summit between the European Union and the Southern African Development Community in Vienna in November will make an important contribution. The Secretary-Generalâs report rightly focuses on the importance of creating an environment in which durable peace is sustained and economic growth promoted. Recognizing that peace and security are indispensable preconditions, we emphasize the need for good governance, including respect for human rights and the rule of law. These values are essential pillars of the European Unionâs development policy, which over several decades has been centred on a genuine partnership with Africa. The European Union is particularly concerned about the ongoing crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the wider dangers for the region as a whole from the escalation of the conflict. In this respect, we hope that the European Union Special Envoy for the Great Lakes region, Mr. Aldo Ajello, will continue to work together with the representatives of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. We urge all the parties involved in the conflict of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to respect human rights and humanitarian law and to abstain from acts of violence against civilians. We welcome African initiatives to find a peaceful solution to this conflict, which can be solved only through a negotiated settlement acceptable to all Congolese. This would allow the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other countries of the region to find the peace and stability that are prerequisites for their development. The Union remains ready to help this political dialogue and to support any negotiation scheme obtaining the consent of all parties involved, inter alia, through the assistance of our Special Envoy for the Great Lakes region. A regional conference could be useful at a later stage to consider the relevant aspects and to strengthen regional cooperation. We are determined to play an effective role in efforts to stop the fighting and restore peace, stability and respect for human rights in Afghanistan. We are committed to bringing about a sustainable peace in Afghanistan, putting an end to foreign intervention, and encouraging intra- Afghan dialogue, in particular through support for the central role of the United Nations. The European Union attaches special importance to the fight against illegal drugs and terrorism in Afghanistan. We remain gravely concerned at the persistent human rights violations and breaches of humanitarian law in Afghanistan. We denounce the continuing discrimination against girls and women in that country. We strongly urge all factions, and in particular the Taliban, to recognize, protect and promote human rights. And we strongly urge them to end discriminatory policies and to recognize, protect and promote equal rights and dignity for men and women. Non-governmental organizations will be able to return to Kabul only when the authorities in Afghanistan have met the necessary conditions. We reiterate our strong concern for the security of United Nations personnel, other related personnel and personnel of non-governmental organizations in Afghanistan, and we recall the responsibility of all factions to ensure safety, security and freedom of movement. We condemn the recent attack against two staff members of the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA) and the killing of Iranian diplomats in northern Afghanistan, and we demand an urgent investigation into these atrocious acts. We call on the Taliban to cooperate fully in ensuring the safe release of the remaining diplomats and other Iranian nationals missing in Afghanistan. We have been deeply involved in the electoral process in Cambodia, especially in voter registration and poll observation, dispatching some 200 election observers who cooperated exceptionally well with the United Nations and other observer groups in the Joint International Observer Group. We call upon all political forces in Cambodia to seize this opportunity to work together, to the fullest extent possible, towards national reconciliation, and express the hope that, with the elections, the foundation for the future well-being and prosperity of the people of Cambodia has been laid. Return to political normalcy will encourage the Union to consider new assistance programmes to help Cambodia in its economic recovery. The Union notes with satisfaction the results achieved at the August meeting in New York, under the auspices of Mr. Kofi Annan, between the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and Portugal on the question of East Timor. We commend the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative for their efforts in this regard. We welcome the Ministersâ agreement to enter into in-depth negotiations on issues related to the question of East Timor, addressed in the final communiquÃ© of the meeting, without prejudice to their basic positions of principle. We hope that these negotiations will lead to a 14 just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution in the near future, respecting the rights and legitimate aspirations of the people, in accordance with the resolutions of the General Assembly and with the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. We welcome the prospect of the closer involvement of the East Timorese in the search for a solution. I am deeply concerned at the continuing violations of human rights and lack of progress towards democracy in Burma/Myanmar. We strongly deplore the repressive actions of the Burmese authorities, including the arrest of several hundred members of the opposition. We call upon the State Peace and Development Council once again to bring human rights violations to an end and to enter into a substantive dialogue with opposition leaders, especially and including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and representatives of ethnic minorities, in order to establish democratic rule in accordance with the will of the people as expressed in democratic elections held in 1990. The Union seeks to cooperate closely with other countries, in particular in the region, to resolve the worrying situation in the country. Although the challenges of the twenty-first century will be different from those we have been used to dealing with in past decades, we are convinced that the United Nations will become more indispensable than ever as the forum for global cooperation. What we have to do now is to make our world Organization fit for the next century. The Secretary-Generalâs reform programme is excellent. The reform of our world Organization is in the interest of all Member States. Of course, reform is not a cost- cutting exercise alone, but an ongoing process which will ultimately lead to a substantial improvement of the work done in the United Nations family. This process will help the Organization to better focus on the fulfilment of mandates and on the improvement of programme delivery. Consequently, the European Union will continue vigorously to support reform based on the proposals of the Secretary- General and the decisions of the General Assembly. As far as the organization and methods of work of intergovernmental bodies are concerned, and especially of the General Assembly, we attach particular importance to the implementation of the reforms already agreed upon. We would welcome further improvements, particularly the streamlining of agendas, the reduction of duplication and better coordination between bodies dealing with similar issues. The European Union firmly believes that the General Assembly should concentrate on implementing the significant agreements reached in some working groups of the General Assembly and at the major United Nations conferences. Carefully wrought compromises that allowed adoption by consensus were the result of a great amount of time and energy invested by all Member States. The European Union is firmly committed to finding solutions to the United Nations financial crisis. Continuing high levels of unpaid assessments are undermining the financial stability and liquidity, and therefore the purpose and goal, of the United Nations. This places a heavy and unfair burden upon troop- contributing countries. The member States of the European Union have consistently honoured their financial obligations towards the United Nations. They pay their contributions in full, on time and without conditions. A sound financial basis requires that all Member States fulfil their Charter obligations. The United States cannot be exempt from such obligations. As a permanent member of the Security Council, the United States has a special responsibility towards the United Nations. We express our sincere hope that Washington will soon settle its arrears and live up to the legitimate expectations of Member States of the United Statesâ role in the world Organization. The European Union has grown from 100 million people to 400 million today. With only 8 per cent of the world population, the Union provides for 60 per cent of development and 50 per cent of humanitarian assistance. Eighty per cent of international aid to Russia and the republics of the former Soviet Union, and 50 per cent of the assistance to the Palestinian territories are paid by the European Union. Forty per cent of the reconstruction help to Bosnia and Herzegovina come from the member States of the European Union. We are the strongest supporter of the United Nations. Our contributions account for 36 per cent of the regular budget and 39 per cent of the peacekeeping budget. The Union is ready to use its political weight for the benefit of the entire international community, in particular developing countries. Let me conclude by reaffirming the European Unionâs deep commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. We will continue to support strongly the United Nations and the Secretary- General in carrying out the key objectives: the maintenance of international peace and security, economic and social progress, and the promotion of human rights and democratic freedoms. 15 The message of the European Union to the United Nations is clear. At the threshold of the new millennium, we face common threats and challenges. We must join forces to harness the benefits and diminish the risks of globalization. We must form a global alliance for human security. Global cooperation, as understood by the European Union, means human solidarity to ensure the survival of our planet and safeguard the future of coming generations. Allow me at the outset to convey my sincere congratulations to Mr. Opertti upon his election as President of the General Assembly at this session and to express my full confidence that he will lead its work wisely and ably. It gives me pleasure as well to pay tribute to the wise leadership of the former Foreign Minister of Ukraine, President of the Assembly at its last session, particularly in promoting the efforts for reform and renewal in the United Nations. 14 I would like also to salute the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who displayed his wisdom and expertise in dealing with world crises and for his outstanding contribution to increasing the efficiency of the Organization in order for it to keep pace with the changing times, contribute to the building of the new international order and avoid the pitfalls. This is the next-to-last session of the General Assembly in this century. Let it be a session for reflection and preparation for the last session of the twentieth century, next year. Let us take stock of the international work of a whole century, its positive and negative aspects alike. Let us evaluate the achievements and innovations of mankind, where it failed and why. Let us list and analyse the work done and the progress made by the United Nations to create constructive international cooperation and establish peace. Let us also talk about what remains on the international agenda and what will be left for succeeding generations to finish and accomplish. In the Charter of the United Nations, we determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. Have we done so? Where did we succeed, where did we fail, and why? We also reaffirmed our faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity of nations and human beings. How far have we gone in translating this solemn reaffirmation into a reality? We committed ourselves to promoting social progress and better standards of life, and to using the United Nations for the promotion of the social and economic advancement of all peoples. Have we honoured that commitment? We determined to practise tolerance and live together in peace and neighbourliness. Have we achieved that? We determined to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security and not to use armed force except for common interest. Has this determination come true? Have we achieved what we determined to do? Immediately after the end of the cold war in the late 1980s, some spoke of “the clash of civilizations”. This is a dangerous theory that concerns humanity and the course it will chart for itself — whether conflict and conflagration or coexistence and peace. We, the representatives of the international community, cannot, at this historical juncture, ignore such a dangerous argument and a destructive theory that runs counter to the common work and collective obligations we agreed upon for international life. We, the children of the twentieth century, must deal with this theory and respond to it clearly. We cannot let such a negative call go without a response or correction. What President Clinton said in his address before the Assembly, rejecting this theory and expressing respect for Islamic civilization, is really worthy of consideration and appreciation. In our opinion, we must offer the next century our confident view that we are one community based on pluralism — intellectual, religious and cultural pluralism and diversity. We must reaffirm that this diversity does not prejudice the unity of the international community. Rather, it strengthens that unity, making the international community a dynamic whole based on healthy competition, positive coexistence and a common appreciation for the achievements of the many societies that constitute the international community. Our community cannot be dependent on the achievements of one single society or tend to follow one single culture. The true path lies in positive interaction, complementarity and coexistence among civilizations. It does not lie in the creation of causes for conflict or in fanning the flames of confrontation and of clash between civilizations. If this is allowed to happen, it will create a dangerous hotbed of world tension and will ultimately result in a grave loss for one and all. Once again we are at a historic juncture where a strong message from this generation is indeed necessary. We want to see the rights of people and nations upheld without differences as to priorities and definitions. We want rational disarmament and an end to the arms race without distinction or discrimination. We want genuine development that does not entrench poverty or ignore its causes. We want a clean environment, a science that benefits all and a technology whose achievements and applications are beneficial to all. We want a common position in the face of international terrorism. We want freedom and liberation for all peoples and a firm stand in the face of the forces of oppression, racism and occupation. We want a commitment to the rule of law and respect for established norms and for the purposes and principles we consensually consecrated in the Charter of the United Nations. In order to evaluate the experiences of the past and to chart our future course, I propose that this session create a committee to commence drafting a clear statement to history to be issued at the close of the next session. This statement should include our assessment of the past and our vision of the future. It should be issued a few days before the end of the century and the beginning of the new millennium. The world today is passing through a stage of chaos, and there is a general feeling of discontent. Wars, 15 terrorism, backwardness, racism, religious intolerance: are these the remnants of past eras? Or are they the result of practices that continue to plague our societies? Or are they an integral part of the fabric of human life? Or are they the result of globalization and the factors of tension and instability contained in the new world order? I believe we all sense the instability in international life. We have witnessed and continue to witness widespread acts of terrorism throughout all continents of the world. We have witnessed widespread extremism in various faiths and widespread injustice in various societies. All this points to the fact that richness and poverty, despite their undisputed importance as two of the facts of life, do not constitute the only causes of world instability. There are other causes, foremost among which is the policy of double standards, the lack of democracy in international relations, the brazen call for a clash of civilizations and the varying interpretations of the principles of legality. All these elements lead to the feeling of discontent, indeed, to the general feeling of insecurity. I believe it is incumbent upon us to consider this matter. These questions call for a clear answer because the challenge is enormous, and the results could therefore be grave. We are all in the same boat. This responsibility is not the responsibility of any one society. If globalization and universality are much talked about, this should mean that they call for a sharing of responsibility. I would like to deal briefly with some of the central issues that occupy our minds at this stage. I shall start with terrorism. Some note, and rightly so, that this international crime against all societies is perpetrated using tight organizations, facilitated sometimes by circumstances in which some have misguidedly supported certain groups by encouraging and dealing with them until those groups turned against them. This is a lesson we must learn in order to avoid its repetition. Furthermore, some have noted, and rightly so, that the hand of terrorism has struck more than one place at the same time: Nairobi, Dar-es-Salaam and Omagh in Ireland. Before then, that hand of terrorism struck many places in the world, for different motives, certainly. But the phenomenon is one and the same, and it is intolerable. We must reflect upon this matter together. In this regard, I would like to underline the importance of the legislation enacted by the British House of Commons on dealing with the acts of conspiracy committed on British territory, of the proposal of President Jacques Chirac of France on controlling the financing of terrorist groups, and of what was said by President Clinton in his statement before the Assembly in this regard. I find it important also in this connection to put before the Assembly the call of President Hosni Mubarak to convene an international summit under the auspices of the United Nations. The summit should direct the international community to deal with terrorism legally, politically, economically and technologically. This call was supported in the final communiqué of the recent summit of the Non- Aligned Movement. I suggest that the General Assembly consider the Egyptian call for the proposed summit. I also call upon the Secretary-General to start working towards its convening. Turning to disarmament, allow me to say that recent developments have proved the shortcomings of the nuclear non-proliferation regime in its current form, which lacks universality. This reaffirms the need for urgent and serious steps to remedy that shortcoming, and to strengthen the efficiency of the regime through achieving its universality and avoiding the policy of double standards; otherwise, we will end up with a state of deep mistrust and an arms race that would in turn lead to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons. For the last three decades, Egypt has consistently called for making the Middle East free from nuclear weapons. This call was further reinforced by its 1990 initiative to make the region free from weapons of mass destruction. Today, we reiterate this call with a view to maintaining peace and security in the region. Starting from this same premise, Egypt, together with seven other States, recently proposed a new agenda to strengthen the international commitment towards a world free of weapons of mass destruction, an initiative we invite the Assembly to support. In this connection, allow me to place on record the call of President Hosni Mubarak to convene an international conference to consider the elimination of those weapons from the whole world within an agreed time-frame. I invite members of the Assembly to work together in order to translate that call into a reality. I now move to the question of the reform of the United Nations. Here, the premise of the Egyptian policy is the same as that adopted by the summit of the Non- Aligned Movement in Durban: we call for commitment to the principles of the Charter and international law as a common position on the agenda for reform. 16 Here, I would like to pay tribute to the Secretary- General for his ideas and initiatives in this regard. I would also like to reaffirm what the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement adopted concerning the importance of taking into account the views of the Member States of the United Nations in the implementation of the reform policies and the reaffirmation of the pivotal role of the General Assembly in the decision-making process, as the main democratic framework of the United Nations. Concerning the Security Council, the position of Egypt is based on the same elements adopted by the non-aligned States as follows: first, the need to deal with the questions of the reform of the working methods of the Security Council and the expansion of its membership within an integrated framework; secondly, increasing the membership of the Security Council by no fewer than 11 members and the allocation of a number of permanent seats for developing countries, with strict observance of the principles of equitable geographical distribution and equality of States; thirdly, the unacceptability of any attempt at a partial or selective expansion of the membership of the Security Council; fourthly, the inadmissibility of any predetermined time-frame to complete the process of restructuring the Security Council; and lastly, the need for any resolution that would result in amending the Charter, the so-called framework resolution, to be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the States Members of the United Nations, in accordance with Article 108 of the Charter. In addition, Egypt is committed to the decision of the summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Harare in 1997 on the allocation of five non-permanent seats and two permanent seats for the African continent, to be rotated in accordance with agreed criteria of the Group of African States. On the subject of the reform of the United Nations, I would like to refer to a matter that was the subject of extensive deliberations in the United Nations and in the recent summit of the Non-Aligned Movement — namely, the sanctions imposed by the Security Council. As the ultimate objective of such sanctions is to influence certain political regimes to bring them into compliance with the rules of international legality, it is therefore necessary that all means under Chapter VI of the Charter be exhausted before resorting to Chapter VII and its applications. The clarity of the objective of imposing sanctions and a thorough consideration of their consequences in the short and long terms, including human suffering, are of paramount importance. An excessive imposition of sanctions, or their perpetuation without acceptable reason or a clear time- frame, will erode their credibility and the commitments made to applying them. Therefore, there is a need for patience, prudence and a determination of the time-frame of sanctions. I now turn to the Middle East, which is suffering from numerous problems, some chronic and others fairly recent, which we hope will not also become chronic ones. I am referring here to the situation of Iraq, which must reach its natural conclusion: the lifting of the sanctions through implementation of the Security Council?s resolutions and in accordance with their provisions. This requires goodwill, proper conduct and the establishment of constructive and stable cooperation between Iraq and the mechanisms of the Security Council. This is a shared responsibility, not the responsibility of one party alone. Needless to say, the elimination of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq is an integral part of their elimination in the region as a whole, as was indeed reflected in Security Council resolution 687 (1991). I would also like to refer to the Lockerbie issue and express our satisfaction at the recent positive development of the situation by the consent of the parties to that yet- to-be settled dispute. This represents significant progress towards the trial of the two suspects and establishing the truth. We all hope that progress will be made, in good faith, as soon as possible within the framework of the contacts made by the Secretary-General and that an agreement will be reached on the required procedures and guarantees. Thus, the whole matter will be put behind us, the sanctions imposed on Libya will be lifted and a long overdue end to a period of tension will come to pass. At another level, we believe that the region must avoid anything that could add to its tensions: declarations of strategic alliances that create discord and lead to counter-alliances; sneaking into the nuclear club, which will lead to an arms race in the region, unless Israel, like all other States of the region, accedes to the Non- Proliferation Treaty; the lack of a solution to the problems and disputes of sovereignty, foremost among which is the question of the three islands of the United Arab Emirates in the Gulf; and attempts at partitioning and jeopardizing the unity and territorial integrity of States, as is the case with Iraq and Sudan. As for the peace process, which is about to collapse, the situation is indeed grave, not only because of the deadlock it has reached, but also because the roots of the 17 problem go much deeper than that. The deadlock is related to the negative change in the policy of Israel, which believes that the current international situation enables it to impose its exaggerated demands on the Arab parties and to impose an Israeli peace on the Middle East. This is probably due to the belief which it has evolved, namely that no person, no Government and no State would be able to stand in its way, pressure it or refuse its demands. We reject this policy, which uses security considerations to justify occupation, thus stripping security requirements, which could be legitimate, of any meaning. Such requirements could have been negotiated and reasonable ones accepted on a reciprocal basis. Yet the validity, true weight and credibility of those Israeli security requirements have become dubious. Egypt, the first Arab State to establish peace with Israel and the largest one with a role in the Middle East and the Arab and Islamic worlds, cannot accept such negative policies, which will drive the region once more towards the flames of tension, conflict and instability. We have made peace with Israel. The Arab States have moved towards the same objective on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which is based on the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force and on Israel?s right to live in peace within its borders — which are, of course, the borders and the lines of June 1967 — as well as on the basis of the Madrid framework, namely, the principle of land for peace. With respect to the Palestinians, the Oslo accord provides for significant Israeli withdrawals before the final status negotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian sides can begin. At their summit meeting in Cairo in 1996, Arab leaders at the highest level expressed the commitment of Arab States to the peace process, since Arab-Israeli peace is a strategic objective to be achieved under international legality. But it requires a corresponding commitment from Israel to follow the road to peace in a manner that restores the rights and the occupied territories of the Palestinians and ensures balanced and equal security to all the States of the region, in accordance with the principle of land for peace. The Arab summit decided that any disruption by Israel of these principles and bases of the peace process; that any reneging on the commitments it has made and agreements reached on the same path; and that any procrastination in their implementation will only set back the peace process. The attendant dangers and repercussions of such actions would relaunch the region into the spiral of tension and compel the Arab States to reconsider the steps they have taken towards Israel within the framework of the peace process. The Israeli Government alone would bear the full responsibility for such a development. Regrettably, it has become evident that the Israeli Government is reneging on the commitments it has undertaken in the context of the Security Council?s resolutions, the Madrid framework and the Oslo accord. This attitude logically compels us to take a forthright and determined opposition to Israel?s negative position, which runs counter to the objective requirements for peace. If we do not, the effective international action necessary to deal with this grave situation will not be forthcoming. We wonder what the Israeli Government really wants. The Arabs have given it acceptance, coexistence, peace and recognition. But it would seem that what the Israeli Government really wants is all of the above, plus most of the land and the privilege to disregard the rights of the Palestinians. This is simply unacceptable. Peoples have their dignity and the rights to their own land and to self-determination. No generation is entitled to cede such rights. They are the rights of all generations — past, present and future — throughout history. We reiterate that Israel must reconsider its position and its policy. The international situation is ever changing. What may be imposed today without justice or balance will disintegrate tomorrow. We want a stable, enduring agreement. This can be achieved only once we agree on a comprehensive package that includes Israel?s complete withdrawal from the territories of Syria, Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza in Palestine; the establishment of a Palestinian State; an agreement on the final status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Palestinian refugees; an agreement on security requirements, without undue exaggeration; the recognition of Israel as a State; and coexistence with it as a member of the family of the Middle East, within the framework of normal relations. I repeat that all this must constitute a package deal that cannot be divided to serve the interests of one party at the expense of the others. Does the Israeli Government recognize the importance of justice and legitimacy? Does it realize the grave and present danger of spurning this opportunity to achieve peace? Letting this historic opportunity slip away and entering the next century with the file of the Arab- Israeli conflict still open will lead to tension and instability not only in the Middle East, but in the 18 international community as a whole. Historical experience has proven that tension knows no boundaries, that instability cannot be confined to one specific region and that international peace and security are indivisible. The international community must therefore raise its voice against the setback of the peace process and play its role in salvaging it. We are not calling for an international trial. Rather, we ask the international community to play its role in safeguarding the bases of peace agreed upon unanimously in the Security Council and at the Madrid Conference, and in the consideration of the measures necessary to restore the process to its correct track and to avert the eruption of further crises in the future. It was in this spirit that Presidents Hosni Mubarak and Jacques Chirac announced their initiative to convene a conference of States determined to save the peace. We must emphasize that this Franco-Egyptian initiative does not aim at replacing or hampering any current positive efforts. It aims, rather, at reinforcing these efforts and ensuring their success, particularly those of the United States, which we support as long as they seek balanced agreements. Egypt accords equal attention to issues of the African continent. Today, we are faced with two urgent and serious matters. The first pertains to the Horn of Africa, namely, the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. We strongly support the mediation efforts, led by the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, to arrive at a peaceful solution and the continued cessation of military hostilities. In this way will normalcy be restored and peace established. The second question is the situation in and around the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Here, the efforts made by the leaders of Africa and the United Nations Secretary- General continue to be important. Such efforts preserve the unity and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and establish positive relations between it and its neighbours in the larger context of a cessation of military operations and of interference in its internal affairs. They also require the maintenance of its national unity within rational democracy. The situation in Africa is being dangerously aggravated by these problems and by the continent?s grave socio-economic situation. This requires special attention, which we call on the international community and the United Nations to give. In conclusion, I must refer to the phenomenon of globalization. We must face its challenges and address its negative aspects, while maximizing its benefits. A number of developing countries have successfully dealt with globalization and achieved their necessary integration into the world economy. At the same time, many developed countries have adopted covert protectionist measures and new conditionalities, such as environmental and labour standards, and continue to maintain tariff barriers against the primary exports of the developing countries. These measures run counter to the equitable bases of the world trading system. This is an important issue which we must address in the context of evaluating past achievements and challenges, and of shaping a new international order. These are the questions which Egypt wished to put before this session as a modest contribution to shaping a common vision that would inspire the march of humanity in the coming decades, during which we hope that justice, equality, progress and prosperity will prevail.  Uruguay comes to the Assembly today with happiness, pride and even excitement at seeing you, Sir, a countryman of ours, representing Uruguay, as President of the Assembly. Uruguay was a founding Member of the United Nations and has been one of the its most active participants ever since, in all its endeavours. It has even contributed its best soldiers, who put their lives on the line every day in the difficult peacekeeping operations of the United Nations. Our country came to this Organization at the time of its founding with the hopes and dreams of a world that was being rebuilt in order to usher in a time of peace, 19 prosperity and stability. It certainly did not come here with any dreams of power, which could have had no place in our country given its small land area and relatively small economy. But we did harbour the dream that has inspired all our great statesmen — that of being a small, model country which in the past century made secular education universal, free and compulsory and built a State of well- being with a solid middle class as the foundation of its political democracy. Thus did our country feel that it was a fundamental part of the democratic development of nations. Unfortunately, we were not exempt from the upheavals and consequences of the cold war. As the Assembly knows, the cold war was bloody and fierce in Latin America. The hemispheres were locked in a state of conflict over positions: here guerrilla wars and there coups d’état, both manifestations themselves as part of a hellish dialectic in which democracies were wounded and sometimes fell. The last few years have shown Uruguay to be a country which is making strides in its economy and prosperity and which, as the recently published United Nations Human Development Index states, is once again making progress. It ranks third among developing countries, and we can say that we have attained the best improvement in the hemisphere with regard to poverty indicators. However, we come to this session not only with the concerns about its institutions and peace which always permeate the spirit of the Assembly; we come here also having seen the spectre of a crisis which began as an Asian financial crisis and which today is a global economic crisis that touches all of us. This undoubtedly deserves particular concern. When we see stock markets carried away by a microclimate of psychosis, and when we see so many irrational phenomena spread, we feel like Anatole France, who saw life as a struggle among various forces, of which we are not always able to know which is the strongest. At times it seems that science and intelligence predominate. At other times it seems that lunacy and fear prevail. This is also part of this phenomenon that started as a financial crisis and then became a very peculiar psychological phenomenon. The point is that, both as Latin Americans and as a member State of the international community, we must once again face this situation. Shakespeare, who is often quoted in connection with major tragedies, said that fate dealt the cards but we were the players. That is our challenge today: how to play our cards in this crisis which could even affect not just finances and economies but also the democratic stability of our countries, our social peace and the fundamental values which inspire us. In the 1980s Latin America went through very difficult economic years. This is referred to — mistakenly in my judgement — as the lost decade, for those were also the years in which we consolidated the strongest process of democratization in our continent, which today allows it to have more democracies and freedoms than ever before. Countries which had never before known democracy are now building republics and institutions and developing their societies. The fact is that after that crisis our countries made enormous efforts at transformation. They lowered their rates of inflation, opened up their economies and began strong processes of integration — in the Andean area, in Mexico to the north and with us in the south, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, and now with Bolivia and Chile as associate partners, to the south. All of this meant that we had a Latin America which was growing again and which would once again be a place for investments; a Latin America which was able to harmonize the return of democracy and peace with economic growth. We now find ourselves faced with the new crisis. What should we do? In our view, the first thing to do is to consolidate and support the Organization and the international community. We should do that here, in this institution, which is a hymn to internationalism, as well as in the economic area. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank — which is the main source of financing for our hemisphere — are the tools we rely on today. We must strengthen them. Indeed, this crisis will leave behind consequences once it is over. Somehow the debate that took place between Lord Keynes and Harry White, at the time of the establishment of the International Monetary Fund at Bretton Woods, hangs over the world today. The British economist held the view that it was necessary to have a central bank of central banks. I shall not bring in that debate here today, but I think that it will nevertheless have to take place once the crucial moments of this crisis are over, because of the need for prevention and for a market economy which actually works. We must all feel and know that the origins of this crisis have been identified. First, there has been excessive speculation, which has been clearly reflected in stock markets. It also stems from macroeconomic imbalances in 20 many States, which have not been able to correct those imbalances, mainly their fiscal gaps, that have been fundamental causes of this situation. Fortunately, the North American economy and the European economy still appear to be solid. Japan is the country of which we are all hoping for a recovery so that the measures under way today will allow us to view much more calmly the future of this situation, which could very well continue for a long time. As the Brazilian Foreign Minister said today, the magnitude and the duration of this crisis are unpredictable, but what should not be unpredictable is the behaviour of States. Therefore, it is essential that we act to bring to an end those financial imbalances and avoid the mistakes and temptations related to such crises. First, we should not believe that by isolating ourselves in neo-protectionism we will find a way out of the crisis. In Latin America in the 1980s we had an external debt crisis. There were those who advocated not repaying the debt and returning in some way to more protected economies. There were those of us, on the other hand, who thought that the debt should be refinanced and that we should join the international community more actively and in that way grow again. Only by growing our economies could the external debt be made manageable in the future. The former, unfortunately, were not lucky and the latter, fortunately, were. In that way, we were able to refinance the external debt and return to investment, and growth enabled us to pay off the debt effectively and thus achieve better living conditions for our peoples. Turmoil and speculation are not what are most needed for the prosperity of needy peoples. To the contrary, profit- making opportunities for speculators come at the expense of the majority. That is the path that we see clearly defined today for this situation, and we must all redouble our efforts in that direction. We will also have to strengthen anew the international financial community so that there can exist a real international safety net that will allow us to work in peace. Of course, the leading economic countries have a great responsibility. President Clinton said last week that this was the most important economic and financial crisis of the second half of the century, and no doubt it is. That is all the more reason for the major economies to assume their responsibilities and for smaller economies, such as ours, which basically seeks more and more equitable living conditions, to try not to bring bad news to the world, even while lacking the capacity and opportunity to be those who can offer the world good news. We should thus protect ourselves from a dangerous neo-protectionism and continue to fight for increasingly open and transparent markets, from which the persistent subsidies in the large States disappear — subsidies in the United States and the European Community, agricultural subsidies which undoubtedly are a troublesome factor in international economic activities and must be left behind. If the crisis teaches us anything, it is that we must find balance, and balance will not be found on the basis of subsidies which continue to promote opportunity for artificial economic sectors. We must also protect ourselves from messianic demagoguery, which is the political dimension of this crisis. For that reason, warding off and resolving the crisis through international cooperation and concrete measures are also very important in a democratic context. When such instabilities occur, messianic demagogues appear, all those pyrotechnists of prosperity who have always led peoples to misfortune and to whom we should not offer, through instability, another opportunity. This is therefore a financial and economic crisis, and ultimately a crisis in political democracy. It is the fundamental chapter through which we must continue to work here. Our world is living in disconcerting times. In 1989, it seemed, with the market economy triumphant over the socialist economy and liberal democracy triumphant over the Communist world, that we were entering an era of peace and stability in which the old Hegelian dialectics would yield to a world of synthesis — what was termed the end of history, what others called the pensée unique. Undoubtedly, that was an oversimplification. Today it would also be an oversimplification to believe that we have once again entered the crisis of capitalism. In my long political career, I have been invited many times to the funeral of capitalism. Times have definitely shown that the market economy, with its dynamics and its spirit of initiative, once again recovered, and this will happen again now because no one is pointing to a better alternative. Therefore, we must not fall into another oversimplification. At one point we believed that the 21 simple freeing of markets would bring about the miraculous result of achieving growth and equity; we cannot now return to the past and believe that through closed economies, through stronger protectionist measures or even through authoritarianism we will be able to resolve a situation that, now more than ever, must be addressed with the guidance of democratic principles. No one has a clear road map. Thus, there is all the more reason to reaffirm the basic principles, the first one being political democracy, which calls on us, as President Clinton said earlier, to fight against terrorism, which through violence attacks democracy, in all its forms, from the outside; and to fight against the enemies which democracy generates from within. At times we have suffered from excessive political passion, which sometimes leads to divisions within countries, intolerance, racial hatred, abuse of economic power and abuse of the media; all of these factors are part of a democracy, but when used without ethical limits they may weaken it. We also have a right to ask the citizen to participate. It is not through an alienated or indifferent citizenry that democracy will be strengthened. Democracy will be closely related to an efficient State, for only an efficient State can stand united if the objective is to improve the lives of our people, only a State which is not a mechanism for waste, but rather a strong instrument to promote the forces of society; to a market economy and increasingly open trade based on standards that protect us from unfair competition; and to a process of integration such as those being carried out in the Latin American countries to enable us to join the world with suitable economies to improve our production. We must also think of the basic values of our societies, such as the family, which is the historic nucleus of our civilization. The weakening of the family has come at a high price. Today, the drug trade reflects the spiritual scourge of societies which, in their economic development, have lost sight of spiritual values. Such societies have weakened the family in a world where images, emptiness and passing trends have caused a vacuum that in turn causes the phenomenon of the search for artificial paradises that aim to replace a meaningful life. We must enhance spiritual factors to give democracies genuine content. We must, of course, be pragmatical in economic matters, but pragmatism alone will not keep alive the hopes of peoples. We must strengthen family values, human dignity and the universality of human rights, as our friend President Mandela has said. We must all respect ethnic individuality; in the final analysis we are all the same. We must all fight against racial discrimination; we must all respect and be very mindful of cultural diversity. But no ethnic or cultural diversity can sanction the enslavement of women or the killing of men: we are speaking here of universal values that are essential to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and that we must not only proclaim but must also practice. As Toynbee said, “Civilization is a movement and not a condition, a voyage and not a harbour” (Readers Digest, October 1958). We must therefore clearly identify the stars that will guide us on that voyage. It is in those stars that Uruguay believes.  On behalf of the Government and the people of the Kingdom of Thailand, I should like to extend my warmest congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti upon his unanimous election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. I wish also to take this opportunity to pay tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko of Ukraine, for his leadership and his tireless dedication to the heavy responsibilities entrusted to him during the past year. With his wisdom and experience, he led us successfully through the fifty-second session, which took place against a backdrop of political transition and economic transformation in the world, as well as of the reform of this Organization. Allow me also to warmly welcome Ms. Louise Fréchette, who has brought creative energy to her new post of Deputy Secretary-General since the beginning of this year. As we gather here to discuss United Nations reform and other issues of vital importance to this world body, it is imperative for us to be clear about what exactly we are trying to achieve. To my mind, many vital questions beg to be answered as the United Nations prepares to meet the challenges of a new millennium. One question that looms large above all others is: What kind of global community do we wish to see in the next century, and what role can the United Nations play in such a community? As Members of the United Nations, what are our shared responsibilities, both individually and collectively, in working towards a global community that fulfils the vision of our founding fathers and reflects today?s changing needs? By what means can we prevent the current economic crisis from undermining the vast progress achieved during the past decade in the social, economic and political areas? In what ways can we transform the challenges emanating from the crisis into opportunities to strengthen the fabric of peace, prosperity and stability around the world? When will we achieve our common aspiration to a world in which democracy is cherished, human rights are respected, sustainable development is practised, economic freedom is exercised, and people are given the opportunity to realize their full potential? I do not pretend to have the answers to all these questions, but I am convinced that, together, we can assist one another in addressing these crucial issues. The United Nations should be exactly what its name implies: a community of nations united in a common vision and common purpose. For in this age of globalization, our destinies are truly intertwined and interdependent. One has to look no further than the economic crisis to realize how necessary it is for us to think and act as a global community possessed of a sense of shared responsibility. For, indeed, the United Nations can only be what we make of it. The United Nations can only be an effective and efficient instrument for peace and prosperity to the extent that we, the Members of the United Nations, demonstrate the will, the resolve and the commitment to move the reform process forward. I therefore wish to take this opportunity to commend the Secretary-General for having so promptly responded to the calls by the Member States to reform the 24 managerial structure and working methods of the Secretariat and to strengthen cooperation among various United Nations agencies. Now that the Secretary-General has done what we have called upon him to do, we, the Members States, must do our part to reform the intergovernmental structure and processes of the United Nations, and we must do so expeditiously. What is plain is that the reforms will not be of any meaningful consequence if we fail to deliver on our support, politically and financially. It certainly serves no purpose to talk about an enhanced role of the United Nations if we fail in our responsibility to provide the United Nations with the means and resources to carry out its mission. For its part, Thailand has done its best to meet its obligations despite the financial difficulties we are going through. That is the least we can do to show our steadfast support for the United Nations and the causes it represents. But the reforms are not an end in themselves. They are the means by which we can make the United Nations relevant to the demands of the changing times. No one can predict what new challenges the twenty-first century may bring. Only one thing is certain, such challenges will be more complex, more multifaceted and more demanding than ever before. At the same time, many current issues promise to play an increasingly significant role in the international arena. These include globalization, human rights, disarmament and illicit drugs. Allow me to touch briefly on each of these issues. The biggest and most complex challenge of our time is globalization, which has emerged as an elemental force of nature, not yet well understood but with the power to build and the power to destroy. In the early part of this decade, we saw mainly the positive side of globalization — more open markets, greater material well-being, more choice and more convenient dissemination of ideas and information. As the end of a decade draws nearer, we are also seeing that globalization is not without cost. Economies are succumbing to volatility beyond their borders. Seemingly isolated crises can send shock waves rippling through the international system. Over the past year, Thailand and a growing number of countries have been penalized by the global financial markets. We recognize that domestic institutional shortcomings were partly to blame for the mismanagement of the economy. Reforms are therefore being undertaken in many of the affected economies, but they will likely take many years to bear fruit. At this point it seems clear that the severity of the crisis has been all out of proportion to the severity of our mistakes. The crisis is no longer an Asian crisis, but a global crisis and a systemic crisis. The industrialized countries, insofar as they stand to gain the most from globalization and lose the most from a worldwide retreat from it, have an obligation to help contain the spreading contagion. The perception that this will stop at a certain point — at Thailand, at Indonesia, at South Korea — has time and again been proven wrong. Now, with the world teetering on the brink of global recession, the G-7, by acting to check the financial crisis, will not be performing an act of global charity but one of self-preservation. The destabilizing potential of unfettered global financial flows, as demonstrated by the Asian crisis, points to a glaring gap in our global economic architecture. I wish to add my voice to the growing calls for the international community — developing nations in conjunction with developed nations — to come up with a mechanism or framework entrusted with the global monitoring and regulation of international financial flows. The United Nations should propose a world conference on the world financial system to be held in the very near future. The proposal by the Committee for Development Planning (CDP) of the United Nations for the creation of such a body or mechanism also merits serious consideration. While such a mechanism is being worked out, we must pay greater attention to the human and social costs of the crisis. To cushion the impact, the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its dialogue partners will be discussing how to promote human welfare and development within the framework of the ASEAN Post-ministerial Conference caucus on social safety nets proposed by Thailand. In this age where ideas can be carried far and wide by the currents of global media, such concepts as democracy, human rights and sustainable development have stirred the imagination of peoples in developing nations everywhere. My delegation would like to congratulate the Secretary-General for strengthening the work of the United Nations on human rights, particularly in bringing Geneva and New York together and appointing Mary Robinson as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Her grace, her experiences, her devotion and her competency will contribute to the protection and promotion of human rights worldwide. 25 ln today?s global village, human rights have become not a luxury but a necessity. Advancing the cause of human rights makes sense not only from a philosophical standpoint, but also from a pragmatic standpoint. Obstacles to and violations of human rights lead to the displacement of populations across borders, with a host of attendant social and economic problems, posing an immense burden on countries of first refuge, receiving third countries, and the international community as a whole. The primary responsibility for observing human rights necessarily rests with the State. Respect for human rights and civil liberties must begin at home. But progress can be slow. Democratization is by definition driven by each country?s own internal dynamics. In South-East Asia the economic crisis has given momentum to the struggle for democracy and human rights. Governments are being challenged to reconcile rising public expectations and demands with pre-existing norms and institutional structures. It may well be that democracy and human rights will gain ground as a result, but there is also a lurking danger that Governments will respond harshly and reverse any progress made. In Cambodia, for example, a fragile democracy is taking root, but the outcome is far from certain. Continuing factionalism threatens to unravel the peace and stability which took so many years to build. As a neighbour, Thailand cannot but be concerned that should this latest attempt at democracy fail, mission fatigue might set in. After spending so much time, energy and money on Cambodia, it is not unreasonable for the international community to expect some compromise among the political leadership, if only for the sake of the country?s long- suffering people. It would be unfortunate indeed if the international community were to give up on Cambodia and turn its attention elsewhere. But Thailand recognizes as well as any country that building democracy is not an overnight process. Thailand does not advocate human rights promotion merely because it is fashionable to do so. Human rights and democracy in Thailand were won the hard way — paid for with blood, sweat and tears. Something that comes at so high a price cannot but command great value. Thailand therefore fully supports the United Nations initiative to strengthen its human rights mechanisms and believes that the global community should step up international and regional cooperation to uphold and promote fundamental human rights. For Thailand?s part, the advancement of human rights and democracy has become an integral part of our national development policy. The most recent manifestation of this effort is our new Constitution, adopted in 1997. I am proud to say that this Constitution — the most democratic in Thai history — accords human rights in Thailand their most prominent position to date and embodies practically all the important elements of the international instruments on human rights. Thailand also gives high priority to the advancement of women and the protection of children?s rights, in keeping with its obligations and commitments under the framework of the international instruments, plans and programmes of action. Moreover, as part of the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, apart from the organization of a series of seminars, Thailand is making plans to accede to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Over the past decade, humanity has made great strides towards global peace, but we have yet to fully reap its dividends. Despite the end of the cold war, nations continue to place greater value on armaments than on meeting the basic needs of their people. One statistic I saw in this year?s Human Development Report was at once startling and disheartening. It indicated that just last year the nations of the world spent a total of $6 billion on basic education for their people, $9 billion dollars on water and sanitation, $13 billion on basic health and nutrition, and a staggering $780 billion on military expenditures. Of the potentially most devastating threats to humanity, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remains particularly worrisome. Thailand is fully committed to the multilateral effort towards disarmament. We welcome the establishment of the Department for Disarmament Affairs, under the leadership of Under-Secretary-General Jayantha Dhanapala, as part of the Secretary-General?s reform measures approved by the General Assembly last year. We will also continue to support, financially and materially, the activities of the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, in spite of financial difficulties at home. Even as we continue our efforts to dismantle and eliminate weapons of mass destruction, we must continue to work towards reducing the conditions that would prompt their use in the first place. Confidence-building 26 through closer dialogue and interaction must be a core component of any effort to build lasting peace. For nuclear weapons, the task of disarmament cannot be left to only the nuclear Powers. The global community must also bring pressure to bear to emphasize that nuclear arms have no place in confidence-building efforts. Thailand thus joined with nine other South-East Asian nations in signing the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, which has already come into force. We are hopeful that the nuclear-weapon States will support our endeavours in this regard by acceding to the Protocol of that Treaty. Thailand also hopes for South-East Asia and the world to be free of anti-personnel landmines. Multilateral attempts to address the problem should not be confined merely to the banning and destruction of landmines. The international community must also tackle other equally important related issues, including the provision of financial and technical assistance on demining to mine-affected countries as well as humanitarian assistance to victims of landmines. My delegation has learned with great pleasure of the rapid process of ratification by signatory States, which would result in the Ottawa Convention entering into force less than six months from now. As a signatory State, Thailand looks forward to ratifying the Convention in the near future. A more insidious but no less destructive threat to humanity is the scourge of narcotics. We all know the corrosive effects that drugs have on the fabric of society, the lives and dreams they shatter on a daily basis. Yet for all our efforts, the problem has never been completely eradicated. My Government has therefore made the fight against narcotics a high national priority. On the occasion of the twentieth special session of the General Assembly in June, Thailand joined with other signatory countries of the 1993 memorandum of understanding on drug control to issue a joint Declaration reaffirming our strong determination to fight the narcotics problem. The following month, in July 1998, Thailand and its fellow ASEAN members issued a joint declaration stating our intention to achieve a drug-free ASEAN by the year 2020. Thailand?s success in opium-supply reduction is a matter of record. But effective drug control also requires demand reduction, towards which the Thai Government is also undertaking various national measures. Accordingly, we welcome the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction adopted at the special session earlier this year. As food for thought, I would like to reiterate my delegation?s view that, for the next decade, international drug-control efforts should focus on the problem of amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) as well as on ways and means to prevent the diversion of precursors used for illicit drug production. This idea was recently agreed upon by members of the Non-Aligned Movement at the summit in South Africa. We urge all States to cooperate in eliminating the supply of ATS and precursors, the illicit market for which is now much larger than that for drugs derived from narcotic crops, the natural sources. As we approach the new century, it is becoming clear that we are also entering a new epoch in human history, unlike any that has gone before. As the forces of technology, globalization and complex interdependence exert ever greater influence on international relations, the coming epoch will be one of great peril but also of great promise. The past year has shown us that our accomplishments rest on fragile foundations. The world now faces a crossroads. One path offers the choice of working harder to forge ever stronger international cooperation, spurred on by the prospect of continued peace and prosperity. Or we can choose the other path and remain apathetic and complacent, lulled by a sense of our own infallibility. The choice is clear enough. But the challenge will be to translate all the good intentions into effective action. Much uncertainty exists in the way international financial markets work, in the appropriate measures and strategies the international community will need to evolve in response to new economic and political challenges, and, of course, in the age-old problems of war and peace. The United Nations, as always, will have a central role to play in resolving the differences among nations and regions, in ensuring the promotion of international codes of conduct and norms, in strengthening preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping, in bridging the gap between the rich and poor nations, in fighting the scourge of international crime, and in promoting and protecting human rights. The United Nations alone cannot achieve these objectives. The fulfilment of our common hopes and aspirations rests not only with the United Nations Organization, but with the united nations of the world. It is up to all of us to make the right choices, to make the difference as humanity prepares to enter the new century with resolve and hope for a better world.
